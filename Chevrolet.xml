[[File:Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]
The Chevrolet Equinox was introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year. Originally, the Equinox was shown at the [[Detroit Auto Show#2003|2003 Detroit Auto Show]].

The Pontiac Torrent was introduced in 2005 for the 2006 model year. The Pontiac Torrent was originally shown at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show#2005|2005 Los Angeles Auto Show]]

Riding on the [[GM Theta platform]], the [[monocoque|unibody]] is mechanically similar to the [[Saturn Vue]] and the [[Suzuki XL7]]. However, the Equinox and the Torrent are larger than the Vue, riding on a {{convert|112.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, {{convert|5.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer than the Vue. [[Front-wheel drive]] is standard, with optional [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]]. They are not designed for serious off-roading like the truck-based [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]].

For the 2006 model year, GM updated the Equinox for the first time, adding GM badges on the front doors, as well as recoloring the dashboard panel from gray to black.

The first generation Equinox and Torrent were produced exclusively at the [[CAMI Automotive]] [[General Motors|GM]]/[[Suzuki]] [[joint venture]] plant in [[Ingersoll, Ontario]], Canada. The 3.4 L ''[[LNJ]]'' [[V6 engine]] is made in [[People's Republic of China|China]] (by [[SAIC-GM-Wuling|Shanghai GM]]), while the [[Aisin AF33 transmission]] is made in [[Japan]]. Starting with the 2008 model year, the Equinox Sport and Pontiac GXP were available with a 3.6&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine that was made in the [[United States]].
Production ended in May 2009.

The Chevrolet Equinox was not sold in [[Mexico]] during the 2009 model year.

=== Pontiac Torrent ===
[[File:Pontiac Torrent -- 08-28-2009.jpg|thumb|left|Pontiac Torrent]]

While the Torrent shares its basic body structure and mechanicals with the Equinox, it does have a different front and rear styling. The suspension (''FE2'') and electronic power steering were both modified to feel firmer and sportier.

The Torrent was discontinued after the 2009 model year as part of the discontinuation of the [[Pontiac]] brand, with the last one rolling off the assembly line on September 2, 2009. A [[Buick]] Theta crossover SUV was to be made, effectively taking place of the Pontiac Torrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig |last=Migliori |work=AutoWeek |date=August 19, 2009 |url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20090819/CARNEWS/908199989 |title=General Motors cancels plans for Buick compact crossover |accessdate=2009-08-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821190742/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20090819/CARNEWS/908199989 |archivedate=August 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, GM replaced the Torrent with the [[GMC Terrain]], which shares the Theta platform with the second generation Equinox.

=== Sport Trims ===
[[File:2008 Pontiac Torrent GXP.jpg|thumb|2008 Pontiac Torrent GXP]]
For the 2008 and 2009 model years, [[General Motors|GM]] offered sportier versions of the Equinox and Torrent; called '''Sport''' and '''GXP''', respectively. Featuring the new 3.6 ''[[General Motors High Feature engine#LY7|LY7]]'' [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[V6 engine]] paired with a new 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] (with Manual Tap Up/Down shifting capability). This larger and more powerful ({{convert|264|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} or 40% increase) engine allowed acceleration from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in under seven seconds.

These models also received a {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} lowered ride height with a performance-tuned suspension and unique front and rear body kits. The lower stance is accented by the 18&amp;nbsp;inch 5-spoke chrome wheels and the absence of the roof rack, giving them a smoother design flow compared to the standard models. The GXP had twin hood scoops, hydraulic power-assisted steering (as opposed to the electric power-assisted standard Torrent), improved interior trim with unique gauges, and a dual chrome-tipped exhaust.

Optional features included [[navigation system|navigation]], heated sport leather seats, DVD entertainment system, a sunroof and all-wheel drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/2008-chevrolet-equinox-sport-revealed.html |title=2008 Chevrolet Equinox Sport |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Motors|GM]] stated the Equinox Sport was the first vehicle to reflect its more cautious naming standards. Instead of using the [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]] badge as it had in the past on higher performance vehicles (such as this one), GM opted to reserve the SS nomenclature for special models worthy of its namesake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/gm-overusing-ss-label-a-mistake.html |title=GM: Overusing SS label a mistake |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date=2006-12-15 |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM also prominently promoted the GXP in television advertisements by touting its horsepower advantage over the BMW X3, in an effort to brand Pontiac more as a direct, low-cost rival to BMW.

=== Equinox LTZ ===
[[File:Nox chrome.jpg|thumb|right|Chevrolet Equinox LTZ]]

An Equinox LTZ model was added{{When|date=June 2018}}. It is differentiated by its 17-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels, bright chrome door handles and bright chrome luggage rack side rail inserts. Standard interior features include heated front seats, leather seating inserts, head [[Side curtain airbag|curtain side impact air bags]], AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD changer and [[MP3]] CD playback capability, and a [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] premium seven-speaker audio system. Equinox LTZ came with the same ride and handling package as LS and LT models.

=== 2008 model features ===
Changes to 2008 Equinox and Torrent models included the relocation of the [[compass]] readout from the inside rearview mirror to the driver information center (on models so-equipped), and three new exterior colors: Navy Blue Metallic, Black Granite Metallic, and Golden Teal Metallic.

[[OnStar]] was standard on the 2008 Equinox and Torrent. This system included for Turn-by-Turn [[Navigation]], the first factory-installed, fully integrated GPS navigation system from OnStar. The 2008 models included an enhanced ride and handling package with stiffer shocks, bushings, and tuned spring rates. Four-wheel disc brakes with [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] and tire pressure monitoring system was standard.

An Electronic Trailer Sway Control was introduced that integrated into the standard [[StabiliTrak]] system. This can detect the occurrence of trailer sway that may be caused by improper trailer weight balance or excessive vehicle speed. If the trailer begins to sway, [[StabiliTrak]] will apply brakes individually, independent of the driver controlling the brake pedal, to assist stabilizing the vehicle. Under these conditions a light will flash to signal the driver to reduce vehicle speed. If trailer sway continues, the system will reduce engine torque to reduce the speed of the vehicle.

Head curtain side air bags were optional.

=== Olympic-themed Special Editions ===
[[File:'08 Pontiac Torrent Podium Edition (Montreal).JPG|thumb|2008 Pontiac Torrent Podium Edition at the [[Montreal Auto Show]]]]

For the 2008 model year, in tribute to the [[Vancouver 2010]] [[Winter Olympic Games]], the Equinox and Torrent each received a special edition; the '''Team Canada Edition''' and the '''Podium Edition''', respectively. This package added chrome-clad wheels, sunroof, premium sound system, and special badging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gm.ca/gm/english/vehicles/chevrolet/equinox/overview | title = 2009 Chevrolet Equinox Overview Page | publisher = GM Canada | accessdate = 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trims were sold only in Canada.

[[File:Chevrolet Equinox 3.6 LTZ AWD 2011 (15200556529).jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Equinox LTZ AWD (Chile)]]
The second generation Equinox was announced by GM on December 21, 2008, and debuted at the 2009 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2008/12/22/2010-chevy-equinox/ |title=2010 Chevy Equinox Unveiled |work=Automoblog.net |accessdate=2008-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606081109/http://www.automoblog.net/2008/12/22/2010-chevy-equinox/ |archivedate=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/auto_shows/2009_detroit_auto_show_naias_auto_shows/production_debuts/2010_chevrolet_equinox_auto_shows |title= 2010 chevrolet equinox auto shows |accessdate= 2009-02-26 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121031161923/http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2010-chevrolet-equinox-auto-shows |archivedate= 2012-10-31 |date= 2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Equinox went on sale in June 2009. It is built on a stiffened version of the same "Theta" platform used in the previous model. The second generation Equinox was built with a pair of upgraded [[gasoline direct injection]] engines, with better fuel economy claimed by GM. Earlier 2010 models had the GM badges on the front doors, but were later deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.detnews.com/article/20090825/AUTO01/908250320/1148/rss25 |title=GM to drop corporate logo from vehicles |publisher=The Detroit News |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing of Chevrolet Equinox resumed in [[Mexico]] during late November 2009, for the 2010 model year after a year of absence. Sales of the Chevrolet Equinox to Mexico were stopped after the 2011 model year. However, in October 2015 the Equinox was reintroduced in Mexico to replace the Captiva Sport for the 2016 model year.

The second generation Equinox is available standard with a 2.4-liter [[Inline-four engine|I4]] engine produced in [[Tonawanda (city), New York|Tonawanda, New York]] and [[Spring Hill Manufacturing|Spring Hill, Tennessee]], with a 3.0-liter V6 engine is available as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/6509317/auto-news/2010-chevrolet-equinox-gets-32-mpg-highway-in-early-tests-awaits-epa-validation/index.html |title=2010 2010 Chevrolet Equinox Gets 32 MPG (13.6km/L) Highway in Early Tests; Awaits EPA Validation |publisher=MotorTrend.com |accessdate=2009-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614184912/http://wot.motortrend.com/6509317/auto-news/2010-chevrolet-equinox-gets-32-mpg-highway-in-early-tests-awaits-epa-validation/index.html |archivedate=June 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both powertrains contain six-speed automatics and optional all-wheel-drive systems, with front-wheel-drive being standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/09/19/2010-chevy-equinox-review/|title=2010 Chevy Equinox Review|publisher=Automoblog.net|date=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation Equinox is Chevrolet's third best-selling vehicle in North America, after the [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado]] and [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-chevrolet-equinox-crossover-photos-and-info-news |title=2016 Chevrolet Equinox Unveiled: New Cosmetics and Gadgets |work=Car and Driver |last=Wendler |first=Andrew |date=Feb 2015 |accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model year changes ===
====2013====
For the 2013 model year, a new direct-injected 3.6L V-6 became available on LT and LTZ models, providing 301 horsepower (225&amp;nbsp;kW) and 272&amp;nbsp;lb.-ft. of torque (369 Nm). This engine offered 14 percent more horsepower and 22 percent more torque than the previous 3.0L V-6, with the same [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]-estimated fuel economy. A new FE2 suspension package was offered, matched with the 3.6L V-6 and packaged with 18-inch or 19-inch chrome-clad wheels on LTZ models. The 2013 model year introduced [[Chevrolet MyLink]] telematics system to the Equinox.

Additional new features for 2013 models included a dual-player DVD entertainment system, a Power convenience package, a safety package with [[lane departure warning system]], [[forward collision warning]] and [[rear park assist]], as well as three new exterior colors; Champagne Silver Metallic, Atlantis Metallic and Tungsten Metallic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/Equinox/2013.html |title=Chevrolet Equinox - 2013 |publisher=Media.gm.com |date=2014-12-15 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014====
For the 2014 model year, chrome-clad wheels became standard on LTZ models, and two new exterior colors, Red Rock Metallic and Silver Topaz Metallic, became available.

====2015====
The 2015 model year saw the addition of OnStar with 4G LTE and built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, which included a 3GB/three-month data trial, standard on LT and LTZ models, with navigation available on LTZ and 2LT. Blue Velvet Metallic and Sea Grass Metallic were added to the list of available exterior colors.

====2016====
For 2016, the Chevrolet Equinox received its first mid-cycle refresh along with its cousin the [[GMC Terrain]], which was unveiled at the 2015 [[Chicago Auto Show]] on February 12, 2015. The refreshed Equinox received a new [[Grille (motor vehicle)|grille]], headlights and front fascia as well as reworked tail lights. In the interior, the Equinox gained a new gear selector, a second storage shelf underneath the dashboard, as well as deletion of the door lock buttons from the dashboard. A new level trim, L, was introduced as the base level, as LS was made the second level, followed by LT and another new trim Premier (replacing LTZ for 2017). Both LT1, LT2, and LTZ level trims were discontinued. Premier took the place of LTZ.
[[File:'16 Chevrolet Equinox.jpg|thumb|2016 Chevrolet Equinox]]
More features are in LTZ and LS trims, while LT is unchanged from 2015. However, the OnStar delete feature was removed along with the discontinuation of five color palates, the CD/AM/FM/MP3/WMA Playback audio system, the rear seat entertainment system and one set of 19-inch chrome wheels. In its place are the Chevrolet MyLink system that became standard on all trims, four new color palates, and new 17- and 18-inch wheel trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/06/2016-chevy-equinox-gets-new-colors-equipment-changes-and-more |title=2016 Chevy Equinox Gets New Colors, Equipment Changes, And More |work=GM Authority|date=June 8, 2015 |first=Chris |last=Ecclestone |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPA fuel economy ratings ===
Skepticism about the Equinox's EPA fuel economy ratings has been raised after a number of road tests at the model's launch achieved 20 to 30% lower fuel economy than the official EPA ratings. After achieving {{convert|18.8|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} in a road test, ''[[Edmunds.com|Edmunds InsideLine]]'' stated, "...our testing didn't come close to achieving [the EPA's numbers], even though we're usually within 1 mpg of the EPA combined number.

[[File:2018 Chevrolet Equinox LT, rear 3.24.19.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
[[File:Chevrolet Equinox 2017 CUV Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]
Chevrolet unveiled the third-generation Equinox on the [[autumnal equinox]] on September 22, 2016.&lt;ref name="2018Equinox"&gt;http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2016/sep/0922-2018-equinox.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gasoline-powered variants of the 2018 Chevrolet Equinox went on sale in early 2017, while diesel-powered variants arrived in autumn 2017.

The third-generation Equinox is available with up to three engine choices.  Gasoline engines are identical to the 2016 [[Chevrolet Malibu]]: a 1.5L turbocharged inline four-cylinder (I4) engine that produces 170 horsepower (12&amp;nbsp;hp less than the 2.4L engine in the previous Equinox but more torque), a 2.0L turbocharged I4 engine that produces 252 horsepower (48&amp;nbsp;hp less than the 3.6L V6 engine in the previous Equinox), or a 1.6L turbo-diesel I4 engine that produces 136 horsepower (the latter will also be available in future [[Chevrolet Cruze]] models as well). The 3.6L V6 engine option did not carry on to the third generation. The 2.0L unit will also be paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission.

New safety features introduced in the third-generation Equinox include a [[Omniview technology|surround-view camera]], [[forward collision warning]], low-speed [[Anti-lock braking system|automatic braking]], a Safety Alert Seat that uses vibration pulses to help alert the driver and avoid crashes, as well as a Rear Seat Alert system that alerts drivers who had opened the back door at the start of a trip to check the back seat once they get to their destination, a feature first introduced on the 2017 [[GMC Acadia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2016/09/22/2018-chevy-equinox-turbo-diesel-engine/ |title=2018 Chevy Equinox gains turbo power and an optional diesel |work=[[Weblogs, Inc.|Autoblog]] |author=Turkus, Brandon |date=September 22, 2016 |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-generation Equinox also introduced a new [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] system from [[GKN Driveline]], which allows the driver to disengage the driveshaft to reduce friction and rotational inertia during the times when AWD is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/equinox/2018/2018-chevrolet-equinox-first-look-review/ |title=2018 CHEVROLET EQUINOX FIRST LOOK |work=[[Motortrend]] |author=Markus, Frank |date=September 23, 2016 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2019 model year, AWD was no longer offered for the diesel-powered Equinox, due to low consumer demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/05/2020-chevy-equinox-gmc-terrain-diesel-say-so-long-to-awd/ "2020 Chevy Equinox, GMC Terrain Diesel Say So Long To AWD"] from GM Authority (May 1, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trim levels===
Chevrolet has released preliminary specifications for the 2018 Equinox. The third-generation Equinox will be available in eight trim levels: '''L 1.5L Turbo''', '''LS 1.5L Turbo''', '''LT 1.5L Turbo''', '''LT 1.6L Turbo Diesel''', '''LT 2.0L Turbo''', '''Premier 1.5L Turbo''', '''Premier 1.6L Turbo Diesel''', and '''Premier 2.0L Turbo'''. Each trim level will feature its own list of standard equipment:&lt;ref&gt;http://gmfleetorderguide.com/NASApp/domestic/proddesc.jsp?year=2017&amp;regionID=1&amp;divisionID=1&amp;type=0&amp;vehicleID=20745&amp;section=oi_def&amp;page=7&amp;butID=16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''L'''/'''1SM''': 1.5L Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine, six-speed automatic transmission, Seventeen-inch all-season tires, seventeen-inch aluminum alloy wheels, Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system (Seven-inch (7.0") color touch-screen display, AM/FM radio, Bluetooth with A2DP wireless streaming stereo audio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, USB integration, and OnStar 4G LTE connectivity), rear view backup camera system, six-speaker audio system, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, keyless access system, keyless ignition with push-button start,  and premium cloth seating surfaces. There are no available options for this trim, being the "base" Chevrolet Equinox trim and is aimed towards fleet purchases, but is still available for public sale. The base trim is available only with Front-Wheel-Drive (FWD) and in only three (neutral only) colors.

'''LS'''/'''1LS''': Sixteen-inch compact spare tire with steel spare wheel. Available options are limited for this trim, being one of the less-expensive Chevrolet Equinox trims, but still comes with a couple packages (one of which includes privacy glass) and adds more color options.

'''LT'''/'''1LT''': Optional 2.0L Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder engine with 9 speed automatic transmission, AWD optional, [[Sirius XM Satellite Radio]], power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, remote start, High Intensity Discharge (HID) front head lamps, and leather-wrapped transmission gear selector. Available options include an eight-inch (8.0") [[Chevrolet MyLink]] infotainment system, and advanced driver assistance technologies.

'''Premier'''/'''1LZ''': Optional 2.0L Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder engine with 9 speed automatic transmission, AWD optional, Eighteen-inch all-season tires, Eighteen-inch aluminum alloy wheels Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system (Eight-inch (8.0") color touch-screen display, AM-FM radio, [[HD Radio]], SiriusXM Satellite Radio, [[Bluetooth]] with [[A2DP]] streaming stereo audio, [[CarPlay|Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]], wireless charging capabilities, USB integration, and OnStar 4G LTE connectivity), remote vehicle starter system, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, heated dual front bucket seats, rear park assist system, leather-wrapped steering wheel, front-mounted fog lamps, LED front headlamps and LED rear tail lamps, and power rear tailgate. Available options include a GPS navigation radio, a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] premium seven-speaker audio system, and advanced driver assistance technologies.

Also there will be one appearance package available on the Equinox known as the Redline Edition. The Redline Edition is only available on the LT trim without the panoramic sunroof or diesel engine. The Redline Edition will be available in October 2017.

The Midnight trim line came to Mexico on September 2, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motorpasion.com.mx/industria/chevrolet-equinox-midnight-mexico-precio&lt;/ref&gt;

===2021 refresh===
On February 6, 2020, Chevrolet unveiled a refresh Equinox at the [[Chicago Auto Show]]. The updated vehicle now sports a new front grille (adopting the Chevrolet design language and having a similar look as the Blazer), which extends into the redesigned headlamps, along with a restyled lower fascia with different foglamps. The rear also sees small changes in the way of redesigned taillamps and a different bumper. The level trims also expands as well, with the RS joining the primary LS, LT, and Premier offerings. The sport/street-centric RS trim is set apart by its unique front and rear fascias, black exterior accents, black badges, “Dark Android” 19-inch wheels and quad-tip exhaust. Inside, the sport-inspired crossover features black upholstery with red contrasting stitching and an RS-branded shift knob. The refreshed Equinox will go on sale in the third quarter of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/02/2021-chevrolet-equinox-unveiled-at-the-chicago-auto-show/ "2021 Chevrolet Equinox Unveiled At The Chicago Auto Show"] from Autoblog (February 6, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holden Equinox===
[[File:2018 Holden Equinox (EQ) LS wagon (2018-11-29) 01.jpg|thumb|Holden Equinox (Australia and New Zealand)]]
[[Holden]] launched the Holden Equinox (EQ series) in [[Australia]] in November 2017, with the first cars arriving in December. It was available with a 1.5 L [[Turbocharged petrol engines|turbocharged]] engine on the base LS and LS+ models, while the more potent 2.0 L turbocharged model was available for all other models - LT, LTZ and LTZ-V. The 1.6 L [[turbo-diesel]] engine launched in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/600902/2018-holden-equinox-pricing-and-specs/|title=2018 Holden Equinox pricing and specs {{!}} CarAdvice|work=CarAdvice.com|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced at GM's [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly|Ramos Arizpe assembly]] facility in Mexico, and replaced the Korean-built five-seat [[Holden Captiva|Captiva]].

The Australasian Equinox was sold alongside the seven-seat Holden Acadia, known as the [[GMC Acadia]] in the Americas, rather than the [[Chevrolet Traverse]], which sits above the Equinox in select [[Chevrolet]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/568625/2018-holden-acadia-quick-drive-review/|title=2018 Holden Acadia quick drive review {{!}} CarAdvice|work=CarAdvice.com|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2018, Holden halted production on the Equinox due to slow sales and unsold inventory at its dealerships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/10/amid-sales-downturn-holden-stops-production-of-commodore-equinox/ "Holden Stops Commodore, Equinox Production"] from GM Authority (October 17, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The Equinox was discontinued in 2020, along with the rest of the Holden lineup, following GM's decision to terminate the marque in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.gm.com/media/au/en/holden/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/au/en/2020/feb/0217_Holden.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuel Cell ==
{{see also|GM HydroGen4}}
[[File:Equinox Fuel Cell EDTA DC 04 2011 1813.jpg|thumb|right|Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell with its first generation]]

The Chevrolet Equinox [[Fuel cell vehicle]] uses [[hydrogen]] for fuel with water as its only exhaust. The Equinox Fuel Cell uses the fourth-generation hydrogen technology found in the [[Chevrolet Sequel]] concept, which was unveiled in September 2009. The fuel cell is designed for only {{convert|50000|mi|km}} of driving, but is engineered to be operable in subfreezing temperatures throughout its life. GM states that the Equinox Fuel Cell is about {{convert|500|lb}} heavier than the original Equinox and has one inch less ground clearance. To reduce weight, it has aluminum doors and a carbon fiber hood. It uses headlights from the [[Pontiac Torrent]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

A dashboard mounted screen calculates the fuel savings to that of a gasoline-powered Equinox. It also includes a kilowatt meter and a fuel cell energy display. The fuel cell has four vapor outlets that replace the exhaust pipe. Three [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon-fiber]] fuel tanks store up to a maximum of 9.25 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s (4.2&amp;nbsp;kg) of gaseous hydrogen at 10,000&amp;nbsp;psi (70 [[megapascal|MPa]]), and give the Equinox a range of {{convert|200|mi|km}}. The Equinox Fuel Cell is certified by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] as a [[zero-emission vehicle]] (ZEV). GM built 115 Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell vehicles and deployed them in 2007–2008 in several target areas including New York and California as part of a comprehensive plan dubbed "Project Driveway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/experience/fuel-solutions/fuel-cell/ |title=The Best Emissions Strategy Is A Zero-Emissions Strategy |publisher=Chevrolet.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Equinox Fuel Cell includes safety features such as [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[traction control system]], and GM's [[OnStar]] telematics service, which offers drivers advice on operating the cars as well as information on nearby hydrogen filling stations. The car meets all 2007 federal safety standards.

=== Performance ===
''[[Motor Trend]]'' assessed the vehicle's performance as nearly the same as the 3.6-liter gasoline-powered equivalent, while bemoaning the dearth of high-pressure hydrogen filling stations near Riverside, California, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kim Reynolds |title=First Test: 2008 Chevrolet Equinox FCV - Waterworks: Fourteen Days In The Hydrogen Economy |journal=Motor Trend |date=October 2008 |url= http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/112_0812_2008_chevrolet_equinox_fcv_first_test/ |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas version==
In 2013, Nat G CNG Solutions and AGA Systems announced that they had begun offering a [[Compressed Natural Gas]] (CNG) version of the Chevy Equinox and the [[GMC Terrain]] using the 2.4 L Direct Injection engine. The natural gas version is a "bi-fuel" CNG vehicle, meaning that it can run on either gasoline or natural gas, giving it extended range. The Terrain/Equinox were the first direct-injection natural gas vehicles ever approved by the US EPA.&lt;ref name="Piellisch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piellisch|first=Rich|title=Nat G CNG for New GM Crossovers|url=http://www.fleetsandfuels.com/fuels/cng/2013/12/nat-g-cng-for-gm-crossovers/|publisher=Fleets and Fuels.com|accessdate=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419100215/http://www.fleetsandfuels.com/fuels/cng/2013/12/nat-g-cng-for-gm-crossovers/|archive-date=19 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver Eagle Distributors, a distributor of [[Anheuser-Busch]] products, was the launch customer for the natural gas version with an initial order of up to 100 of the natural gas GMC Terrains. [[CenterPoint Energy]] was an early customer of the natural gas Chevy Equinox.&lt;ref name="Yahoo Finance"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aga-systems-nat-g-cng-150000994.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420074442/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/aga-systems-nat-g-cng-150000994.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 20, 2014 |date=November 18, 2013 |work=Business Wire |publisher=yahoo.com |accessdate=November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CNG configurations ===
The CNG version was available as a newly purchased Equinox through select dealers or as a retrofit on 2013 and 2014 models. Nat G CNG Solutions offered the vehicle in two options: a two-seater "cargo version" and a five-seat "passenger version." The cargo version has an 837-mile combined gasoline / natural gas (9.2 [[Gasoline gallon equivalent|gge]] of CNG) while the passenger version has a 775-mile combined highway range (6.8 [[Gasoline gallon equivalent|gge]] of CNG).

=== Emissions and performance ===
The companies claimed that the natural gas version had tested at the EPA lab at 31 mpg highway on natural gas and had achieved a Bin 3 emissions equivalent to the [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref name="Piellisch"/&gt;

== Electric conversion ==
[[File:Equinox amp EV EDTA DC 04 2011 1834.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Equinox [[Amp Electric Vehicles|AMP]]-converted [[battery electric vehicle]]]]
[[Amp Electric Vehicles]] sells an [[all-electric vehicle|all-electric]] conversion of the Chevrolet Equinox. They have sold their first electric Equinox to [[DPL Inc.|Dayton Power &amp; Light]], and had a five-year, thousand-SUV order from Northern Lights Energy in [[Iceland]].

The '''Chevrolet Biscayne''' was a series of [[full-size car]]s produced by the [[United States|American]] manufacturer [[Chevrolet]] between 1958 and 1972. Named after a show car displayed at the 1955 [[General Motors Motorama]], the Biscayne was the least expensive model in the Chevrolet full-size car range (except the 1958-only [[Chevrolet Delray]]). The absence of most exterior and fancy interior trimmings remained through the life of the series, as the slightly costlier [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] offered more interior and exterior features at a price significantly lower than the top of the line [[Chevrolet Impala]].

The Biscayne was named after [[Biscayne Bay]], near [[Miami]], [[Florida]], following a trend by Chevrolet at the time to name cars after coastal cities or beaches such as the Bel Air and the later [[Chevrolet Malibu]].

__TOC__

==Overview==
Biscaynes were produced primarily for the fleet market, though they were also available to the general public — particularly to those who wanted low-cost, [[no-frills]] transportation with the convenience, room and power of a [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[car|automobile]]. While most Biscaynes were sold with a six-cylinder engine through the late 1960s, the [[V8 engine|V8]] engine became the more popular powerplant by the early 1970s.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Footnotes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;. The Biscayne was usually built as a two- or four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], although a four-door [[station wagon]] was available between 1962 and 1968 (and again after 1973 in Canada only). A low-priced, full-size Biscayne [[station wagon]] equivalent was available as the [[Chevrolet Brookwood]] both before and after this period. The two-door sedan was dropped after 1969, and consequently, from 1970 to 1972 the only Biscayne model available was a four-door sedan. In 1958, the [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]] was priced below the Biscayne but was discontinued the following year. 

Many of the luxury convenience options available on the more expensive full-sized Chevrolet models, such as [[power windows]], were not available on the Biscayne. However, customers could purchase a Biscayne with any of Chevrolet's high-output [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|big-block]] [[V8 engine|V8]] engines and performance-oriented transmissions, including the floor-mounted four-speed [[manual transmission]] with Hurst shifter and low-ratio final drive. Original production numbers of cars built this way were very low, and examples of these high-performance cars are highly sought after by collectors today. Notably, Baldwin Chevrolet of Long Island, New York, became famous for offering the "Street Racer Special," a 1968 Biscayne coupe with dealer-fitted high-performance 427 cubic-inch V8, and heavy-duty suspension components, turning the Biscayne into a serious drag car.  Biscayne with high-performance equipment was often nicknamed "Bisquick" by enthusiasts.

Like the slightly upscale Bel Airs, Biscaynes are easily identified by the use of two taillights per side; the only exceptions to this were in 1959 and 1972. The more expensive Impalas (and later Caprices) have three taillights per side. The Biscayne was largely devoid of exterior chrome trim and was normally fitted with small hubcaps, though several exterior trim pieces and upgraded wheel covers were available at extra cost. Interior trim was spartan, with lower-grade cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery trim, a standard steering wheel with centre horn button, and rubber floor mats. Slight upgrades were made throughout the life of the series — for instance, the 1964 models came standard with deluxe steering wheels with horn rings, deep-twist carpeting and foam-cushioned front seats.

At its introduction for the 1958 model year, the Biscayne was available as a two- or four-door pillared sedan. In 1958, there was also the even lower-priced [[Chevrolet Delray]], but this was discontinued for 1959. In 1959, the car was redesigned, and now sat on an inch-and-a-half ({{convert|1.5|in|cm|disp=output only}}) longer wheelbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure/1959%20Chevrolet-02.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the two-door Utility Sedan appeared, a version lacking a rear seat and being intended as a delivery vehicle.

===Biscayne Fleetmaster===
In 1960, a lower-priced, sparsely trimmed version of the Biscayne called the Fleetmaster was produced. Aimed primarily at the fleet market, the Fleetmaster included a lower grade of upholstery than the standard Biscayne and deleted routine convenience items such as a [[Cigarette lighter receptacle|cigarette lighter]], door armrests, and passenger-side sun visor. In addition, many parts were painted rather than [[Chrome plating|chrome plated]]. Both two- and four-door sedans were available.

A number of economy-minded options were available exclusive to the Fleetmaster model, although the performance-oriented engines and transmissions were also available (for police applications or performance-oriented customers who wanted the lightest car possible). The Fleetmaster was dropped after 1961.

The Biscayne underwent a full model change for the 1961 model year. The stripped down Fleetmaster and the three-passenger Utility Sedan were still available for 1961 but sold in very small numbers. Series numbers were 1100 and 1200 (six- and eight-cylinder Biscayne), with the 1300 and 1400 used for the six- and eight-cylinder Fleetmaster. For 1963, the short-stroke [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#Third generation|third generation]] inline-six replaced the earlier "Stovebolt" 235, meaning lower weight and a slight gain in power.

In 1962, a four-door [[station wagon]] version appeared, replacing the earlier [[Chevrolet Brookwood|Brookwood]] model. As usual, the full range of GM's full-size engine and transmission options were available to the low priced Biscayne. A very few of the brand-new, high-powered 409 V8s (of which only 142 were built in 1961) even found their way into the bargain-basement Biscayne Fleetmaster, with the direct intention of being used for drag racing.&lt;ref name=409no41&gt;{{cite web | last = Marion | first = Doug | title = 1961 Chevrolet Biscayne Fleetmaster - 41 From ’61 = 1 Of A Kind | url = http://www.superchevy.com/features/1306-1961-chevrolet-biscayne-fleetmaster-41-from-61-1-of-a-kind/ | publisher = The Enthusiast Network | work = Super Chevy | accessdate = 2015-06-08 | date = 2013-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-new 1965 Biscayne was larger yet, and offered an even wider range of engines, including a new, larger 250-ci inline-six. For the 1967 model year the smaller 230 was dropped. For 1966 the top engine became the new [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|Big-Block]] 427&amp;nbsp;ci V8, available in a high-powered, high-revving {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version with solid lifters. Although not available for the big Chevrolets in 1967, it returned in 1968 for two more model years.  After 1968 the Biscayne station wagon was discontinued, henceforth being sold as the [[Chevrolet Brookwood|Brookwood]]. [[Power steering]] and power brakes were made standard for the 1970 model year.

}}

The TurboHydramatic transmission was made standard on all cars ordered with a V8 engine starting midway through the 1971 model year. Production of the Biscayne for the United States market ended for 1971. However, the Biscayne name survived in [[Canada]] through the 1975 model year, with a 350 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]] engine and TurboHydramatic [[automatic transmission]] made standard for 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Mays|first=James C|title=1974 Chevrolet Caprice Classic, Impala, Bel Air and Biscayne|url=http://www.oldcarscanada.com/2012/08/1974-chevrolet-caprice-classic-impala.html|work=www.OldCarsCanada.com|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station wagon model had been sold as the [[Chevrolet Brookwood|Brookwood]], but for 1973 the Biscayne station wagon made a return for the Canadian market only. Like its stablemates, the 1975 Biscayne received new dashboard, radio and climate control graphics (including a 100-mph speedometer with kilometer equivalents) and the availability of two new options: an Econominder gauge package (with temperature gauge and a gauge that monitored fuel economy, based on the driver's current driving habits) and intermittent windshield wipers.

The fourth generation wagons featured a [[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|'clamshell' design]] marketed as the ''Glide-away'' tailgate, also called a "disappearing" tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor.  The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate.  Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate.&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The '71 Wagons, Big Changes Coming Up |journal=Popular Science |date=October 1970 |pages=74–75 |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |first2=Jim |last2=Dunne |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22glide+away%22+tailgate#v=onepage&amp;q=%22glide%20away%22%20tailgate&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years.  Wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat &amp;mdash; and could accommodate a 4 x 8' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded.  The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door &amp;mdash; for example, in a closed garage.

The '''Chevrolet Niva''' is a mini [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV) produced by [[GM-AvtoVAZ]], a joint venture between [[AvtoVAZ]] (the parent company of the [[Lada]] brand) and [[General Motors]], since 1998. The car is a development of the [[Lada Niva]] and was previously known as the VAZ-2123 in the design stage.

==First generation==
[[File:Нива Ваз 2123 1.JPG|thumb|left|VAZ-2123 (1998–2002)]]
[[File:Chevrolet Niva Silver.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Niva (2003–2009)]]
It features an updated body and 1.7-litre gasoline engine with [[fuel injection]]. Although the body and the interiors are new, it is still based on the old VAZ 2121 engine, transmission and most mechanicals.

In 2003 the car was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian [[ARCAP]] safety assessment program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevrolet Niva|url=https://autoreview.ru/arcap/cars/Chevrolet/Niva|website=Авторевю|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An export version with reinforced hull, 1.8-litre Opel [[GM Family 1 engine#Ecotec|Ecotec Family 1]] gasoline engine and [[Aisin]] [[four-wheel drive]] has been under consideration since 2003. Although most of the engineering work has been completed, the release has been constantly postponed. Although the GM-AvtoVAZ considered building a new engine plant for the local production of Ecotecs, in July 2005 it was announced that the project was cancelled, along with plans for the long-anticipated "export" Niva. However, the project was revived in Fall 2006 and the "Niva FAM1" was introduced as a new trim level for the 2007 model year. The price was much higher than the standard trim, that made the project not as successful and led it to be discontinued in April 2008. Another reason was the ceasing of Ecotec engine production at the Hungarian plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.autonavigator.ru/news/2008/04/25/9529.html |title=Chevrolet Niva FAM1 больше не выпускается |language=Russian |publisher=AutoNavigator.ru |date= |accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the model got a minor update, featuring a slight restyling, done by [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] studio and some minor-changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gm-avtovaz.ru/chevrolet_niva/about/ |title=О Chevrolet NIVA |language=Russian |publisher=Gm-AvtoVAZ.ru |date= |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLS and GLC version also comes with improved safety, such as ABS and dual front airbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niva-chevrolet.com.ua/chevrolet-niva-new.html |script-title=ru:Нива Шевроле |publisher=Niva-Chevrolet.com.ua |language=Russian |accessdate=3 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104214552/http://www.niva-chevrolet.com.ua/chevrolet-niva-new.html/ |archivedate=4 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM-AvtoVAZ introduced a concept vehicle for a new generation of the Chevrolet Niva at the [[Moscow International Automobile Salon]] in late August 2014.&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{cite web|title=Концепт Chevrolet NIVA нового поколения на ММАС 2014|url=http://media.gm.com/media/ru/ru/chevrolet/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/ru/ru/2014/chevrolet/08-13-niva-concept.html|publisher=Chevrolet Media|accessdate=24 August 2014|language=Russian|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Niva Concept, designed by Ondrej Koromház of GM (or at General Motors' headquarters in Melbourne according to other sources),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/516693/new-lada-niva-for-2018-could-it-be/|title=New Lada Niva for 2018… Could it be?|publisher=Caradvice.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a longitudinal mounted engine, full-time four-wheel-drive, two-gear transfer case and rigid-axle rear suspension. The production model was supposed to get a 1.8-liter [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] EC8 engine (135&amp;nbsp;hp) paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wroom.ru/en/news/2572 |title=Chevrolet Niva Concept debuted in Moscow |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 August 2014 |website=Wroom.ru |accessdate=2 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209110538/http://wroom.ru/en/news/2572 |archivedate=9 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although more recent news reports suggested that it was planned to be based on the [[Renault Duster]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.news-original.ru/gm-avtovaz-is-preparing-a-chevrolet-niva-2-on-the-platform-of-renault-duster.html|title=«GM-AVTOVAZ» is preparing a Chevrolet Niva 2 on the platform of Renault Duster|publisher=News-original.ru|access-date=2017-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308222614/http://en.news-original.ru/gm-avtovaz-is-preparing-a-chevrolet-niva-2-on-the-platform-of-renault-duster.html|archive-date=2017-03-08|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new model's production version was initially expected in 2016,&lt;ref name="concept"/&gt; but following Chevrolet stopping sales of its mainstream models in Russia, no information has been released on the topic.
In September of 2018, it was reported that GM has suspended all the work on planned replacement of Chevrolet Niva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20180921/COPY01/309219979/gm-suspends-work-on-chevrolet-niva-replacement|title=GM suspends work on Chevrolet Niva replacement|publisher=[[Automotive News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Chevrolet Citation''' is a range of [[compact car]]s that was produced by the [[Chevrolet]] division of [[General Motors]].  The first Chevrolet sold with [[front-wheel drive]], a single generation of the Citation was sold from the 1980 to 1985 model years, succeeding the [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevrolet Nova]].  The model range was offered in three body styles: three-door and five-door hatchbacks and a two-door [[Notchback|notchback coupe]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-citation1.htm|title=Chevrolet Citation|last=|first=|date=2007-08-02|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Citation was built on the second-generation compact GM [[GM X platform (1980)|X-platform]].  For 1980, the platform was switched to front-wheel drive and significantly [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]] (nearly reducing its exterior footprint to that of the 1970s [[GM H platform (1971)|H-platform]] subcompacts).  The Citation was sold alongside the [[Pontiac Phoenix]], [[Buick Skylark]], and [[Oldsmobile Omega]]; while the Phoenix was also produced as a hatchback and the Skylark and Omega were produced as two-doors, the two-door notchback coupé body was exclusive to the Citation.  Alongside a standard trim level, Chevrolet offered the Citation X-11, offering performance-oriented upgrades. 

In an extended 1980 model year, over 800,000 examples of the Citation were sold; along with becoming the best-selling car in the United States for the model year, the Citation was among the most successful product launches in General Motors history.&lt;ref name="how stuff works"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-citation2.htm|title=Chevrolet Citation|author=The Auto Editors of Consumer Guide|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the 1981 model year, sales of the Citation significantly decreased as the launches of the [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] and [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] expanded the front-wheel drive Chevrolet product range.  After the 1985 model year, Chevrolet discontinued the Citation, replacing the model line with the [[Chevrolet Beretta]] two-door coupe and [[Chevrolet Corsica]] four-door sedan/five-door hatchback.  In total, Chevrolet manufactured 1,642,587 examples of the model line during its production run.&lt;ref name="how stuff works" /&gt;

== Development ==
To better compete in the compact segment following the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 fuel crisis]], General Motors commenced work in April 1974 on a replacement for its [[GM X platform (1962)|X-body]] compact lines, including the [[Chevrolet Nova]].  As the 1970s progressed, import-brand compact cars continued to grow in popularity, gaining sales from domestic counterparts.  Largely serving as a second generation of the [[Chevrolet Vega]], the [[Chevrolet Monza]] proved relatively successful, though inefficient and outdated in comparison to front-wheel drive compacts such as the [[Honda Accord]] and the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Volkswagen Rabbit]] (the layout of the latter was nearly copied outright by Chrysler to develop the 1978 [[Dodge Omni|Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon]]).   

While GM had produced front-wheel drive vehicles for nearly a decade, its experience involved large personal luxury coupes ([[Cadillac Eldorado]] and [[Oldsmobile Toronado]]) and recreational vehicles ([[GMC motorhome|GMC Motorhome]]), neither fuel-efficient nor compact.  Following the reverse-engineering of [[Lancia]] vehicles, GM selected a transverse front-wheel drive layout for the new X-body&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.automobilemag.com/news/gm-x-cars-chevrolet-citation-oldsmobile-buick-pontiac-photos-history/|title=GM's X-Cars: Anatomy of a Miserable Failure {{!}} Automobile Magazine|date=2019-05-21|website=Automobile|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;; in the mid-summer of 1976, the first vehicle prototypes entered testing; in its development, Chevrolet would design the front suspension of the platform, with Pontiac responsible for the rear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;     

Intended for a 1978 model release, the Chevrolet Nova replacement was to adopt the "Condor" nameplate.  Coinciding with the downsizing of the A-body mid-size line for 1978, the launch of the Chevrolet Condor was moved to 1980, as GM parts suppliers were trying to adjust to large-scale production of a front-wheel drive car.  During the delay, the Chevrolet Condor name was scrapped in favor of Chevrolet Citation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://everything2.com/user/schizophasic/writeups/Chevrolet+Citation|title=Chevrolet Citation (thing) by schizophasic - Everything2.com|website=everything2.com|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
Along with its debut as the first front-wheel drive Chevrolet, the Citation also marked the downsizing of the Chevrolet compact model line (following the downsizing of the 1977 Caprice/Impala and 1978 Malibu).  While packaged with similar interior space as the Malibu and trunk space as the Impala&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dancummins.com/remembering-chevy-citation/|title=Remembering the Chevy Citation {{!}} Dan Cummins|last=KY|last2=https://www.dancummins.com/wp-content/themes/DealerInspireDealerTheme/images/logo.png|first2=40361 United States 877-661-2805|website=Dan Cummins Chevrolet Buick|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Citation shed 20 inches of length (only an inch longer than a Vega), 4 inches of width, and 800 pounds of weight from the 1979 Nova.

Through its production, as one of the front-wheel drive X-body vehicles, the Chevrolet Citation would undergo a number of manufacturer recalls.  In 1980, 225,000 examples were recalled to fix a transmission hose related to underhood fires.&lt;ref name="how stuff works" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/series.aspx?modelID=3441|title=Citation - Model Information|website=conceptcarz.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The X-body cars (which included the Citation) were the target of an unsuccessful lawsuit by the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), which cited a tendency for the vehicles to lose control under heavy braking, and power steering problems.

[[File:1980 Chevrolet Citation fr.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Citation 3-door]]
[[File:Chevrolet Citation.jpg|thumb|1980 Citation 5-door]]
In April 1979, the Citation was released as a 1980 model in two trim levels. Alongside the standard trim, a sporty X-11 version was produced.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Priced under [[US dollar|US$]]6,000, with hatchbacks in a much larger package than the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, demand proved very high for the Citation. Helped by an April release and yet another gasoline shortage during the same time, over 800,000 Citations were sold by Chevrolet for the model year. However, as the second gas crisis created demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles, GM was left with significant shortages of 4-cylinder engines, leaving some customers to wait several months to receive their vehicles.  Before the fuel crisis, Chevrolet had anticipated 70% of customers purchasing the V6 engine option, leading to production lines unable to keep up with demand for four-cylinder models.

In an extended 1980 model year, Chevrolet would sell over 810,000 examples of the Citation; in addition to making for one of the most successful product launches in General Motors history, the Chevrolet Citation would become the best-selling car in the United States in 1980.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

=== 1981 ===
For 1981, while the Citation saw no visible changes, the model line was pared down, with the two-door coupe discontinued (in response to slow sales).&lt;ref name= "how stuff works"/&gt;  The X-11 gained additional performance, as the model received a 135-hp high output version of its 2.8L V6.&lt;ref name= "how stuff works"/&gt;  

In 1981, the Chevrolet Citation gained its most direct competitor, as Chrysler introduced the [[Plymouth Reliant|Dodge Aries/Plymouth Reliant]] (the [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K-Cars]]).  While also produced in front-wheel drive, the K-Cars offered sedan and station wagon body styles unavailable from Chevrolet.  

=== 1982 ===
[[File:Chevrolet Citation Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|The Citation coupe body was unique to Chevy and not shared with another GM badge]]
For 1982, fuel injection was added to the 2.5L engine; to further increase fuel economy, low rolling resistance tires were added to all Citations (including the X-11).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-citation3.htm|title=Chevrolet Citation|last=|first=|date=2007-08-02|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a running change during the year, the two-door notchback (coupe) made its return after being dropped for 1981.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

Chevrolet introduced two models for 1982 that would produce a significant effect on Citation sales.  Phased in to replace the Malibu, the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] was an [[GM A platform (1982)|A-Body]] vehicle.  While sharing its wheelbase and powertrain with the Citation, the sedan and wagon bodies of the Celebrity were considered mid-size cars.  Replacing the Monza, the [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] J-body subcompact further expanded the front-wheel drive product offering with its own coupe, hatchback, and station wagon competing closely against the Citation.

The Citation, Celebrity, and Cavalier were sold with Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac counterparts (the latter was also sold as a Cadillac).  

=== 1983 ===
For 1983, few external changes were made to the Citation, while several revisions were made to the interior.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-citation.htm|title=Chevrolet Citation|date=2007-08-02|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dash underwent minor trim updates for the first time since 1980, with the front seats receiving adjustable head restraints.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The X-11 package returned to the two-door coupe (for the first time since 1980), while its HO V6 became an option on all Citations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  

=== 1984 ===
[[File:Chevrolet Citation II rear.jpg|thumb|250px|Chevrolet Citation II|alt=]]
For 1984, the Citation was renamed the Citation II.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-citation.htm|title=Chevrolet Citation|date=2007-08-02|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While undergoing almost no visible changes outside of badging, the rebranding was intended to draw attention away from previous recalls and quality issues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  All three body styles remained, along with the X-11.      

For the first time, Citation sales increased over the previous year (though remaining under 100,000).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;    

=== 1985 ===
For 1985, the Citation II saw several revisions in its final year of production.  The two-door Citation II was discontinued for good, though the X-11 remained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The dashboard underwent a redesign with a horizontally-mounted radio and a new steering wheel.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The 2.8L HO engine became fuel injected (reducing output to 130 hp).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The last Citation rolled off the assembly line on June 21, 1985.

==Powertrain==
In addition to the X platform, GM also created a new line of engines for the Citation and its sisters. The 2.8&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LE2|LE2]]'' [[V6]] was the first of the [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine|60°Family]] of [[Internal combustion engine|engines]]. The X platform was used in 1982 as the basis for the new [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (FWD)|A-body]] cars. The X platform was also the basis for the future [[GM L platform|L-body]] and [[GM N platform|N-body]] cars.

==X-11==
[[File:1980 Chevrolet Citation X11.jpg|thumb|1980 Citation X-11]]
Produced as a separate trim level, the Citation X-11 was a variant featuring cosmetic, chassis, and powertrain upgrades over the standard Citation.  While less powerful than the Camaro Z28 (and later Monte Carlo SS), the Citation X-11 would also take over the role of the similarly-sized Chevrolet Monza.  The X-11 was offered throughout the production run of the Citation/Citation II, on the 3-door hatchback and 2-door "club coupe" (discontinued in 1981 and 1985).

In 1981, the Citation X-11 accelerated from 0–60 MPH in 8.5 seconds; the 1982–1984 version accelerated from 0–60 MPH in 9.2 seconds. 

=== Chassis upgrades ===
At its 1980 launch, the chassis of the Citation X-11 was upgraded with front and rear stabilizer bars and a retuned sport suspension, which were kept throughout its production.  In place of steel wheels, the X-11 featured 13-inch [[rallye rim|rallye rims]] with Goodyear P205/70R-13 white-letter tires.  In 1981, the 13-inch wheels were replaced with 14-inch wheels with Goodyear Eagle GT P215/60 R14 radial tires.  To upgrade handling, for 1982, the steering rack was relocated from the firewall to the subframe holding the engine and front suspension. The design change was intended to prevent subframe movement from affecting steering behavior.  

For 1980, the X-11 offered only handling upgrades over a Citation, with the powertrain consisting of a 90hp 2.5L inline-4 and a 115hp 2.8L V6.&lt;ref name="how stuff works" /&gt;  Alongside the standard Citation, the X-11 was available with either a 4-speed overdrive manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic transmission (the only transmission available for 1985).      

To aid acceleration, axle ratios of the X-11 were changed, alongside the transmission gearing. A taller first gear was intended to allow the X-11 to accelerate to 60 mph without shifting to third gear.  For 1981, the X-11 was powered exclusively by a "high-output" version of the 2.8L V6; a higher-performance dual-tip exhaust system raised output to 135hp/165lb-ft of torque.  As before, the X-11 maintained separate final-drive ratios.&lt;ref name="how stuff works" /&gt;  In 1982, emissions regulations required a decrease in torque output, to 145 lb-ft (horsepower remained unchanged). This output remained the same through 1984.  In 1985, the carbureted engine was replaced by a fuel-injected version of the 2.8L V6 with output decreased to 130hp/155lb-ft of torque.  In slightly different tuning, the Citation X-11 shared its powertrain with the Chevrolet Celebrity Eurosport, Pontiac 6000STE, and Pontiac Fiero.

=== Body upgrades ===
In 1980, the Citation X-11 shared most of its powertrain with the standard Citation, with the model being mostly a chassis and visual upgrade.  Alongside the alloy wheels and tires, the X-11 featured a trunklid spoiler, sport mirrors, body skirting, and side striping.  In 1981, to better distinguish the model from standard two-tone Citations, the side striping of the X-11 was replaced in favor of large "X-11" door graphic, which remained in use for the rest of its production.  The model is best distinguished from a standard Citation by its use of a black grille (the only exterior chrome trim on a Citation II X-11 is the Chevrolet grille bowtie and trunklid badging).  In 1981, a functional cowl-induction hood scoop was added.  Under hard acceleration, a solenoid operated switch opened a flap that let in extra air.

While produced without the front bench seat seen in the launch of the Citation, the interior of the X-11 was most widely differentiated with the use of a sport steering wheel.  The X-11 was produced with its own instrument panel, which featured a full set of engine gauges (6000 RPM tachometer for 1980, 7000 RPM tachometer for 1981–1985).

=== Racing ===
The [[SCCA]] classified the X-11 in Showroom Stock B class. Bob McConnell drove a 1981 X-11 to SSB National Championships in 1982 and 1984.

== Awards ==
The Chevrolet Citation was awarded [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] for 1980.   In 2009, the editorial staff of Car and Driver criticized the 1980 Motor Trend decision (alongside several other vehicle awards&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/dishonorable-mention-the-10-most-embarrassing-award-winners-in-automotive-history|title=Dishonorable Mention: The 10 Most Embarrassing Award Winners in Automotive History|date=|publisher=www.caranddriver.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;), citing poor build quality and mechanical reliability undeserving of such an award in hindsight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

[[Car and Driver]], along with several other car magazines of the time, were duped when GM lent them specially modified versions of the X-body vehicles in which heavy [[torque steer]] had been engineered out (torque steer was a handling trait common to X-platform vehicles).  [[Patrick Bedard]] of ''Car and Driver'' said that they were completely surprised by this when they drove a production version some time later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/08q2/the_skeptic_has_a_malibu_moment-column|title=The Skeptic has a Malibu Moment – Column – Auto Reviews|publisher=Car and Driver|accessdate=2010-05-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609084833/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/08q2/the_skeptic_has_a_malibu_moment-column|archivedate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the other X-body cars, the Citation was plagued by numerous reports of a [[GM X platform (1980)#Mechanical problems|tendency to lock the rear wheels upon braking]], causing it to lose control and crash.

The '''Chevrolet HHR''' (an initialism for Heritage High Roof)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.autoblog.com/chevrolet/hhr+panel/&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Retro-style automobile|retro-style]]d, high-roofed, five-door, five-passenger, [[front-wheel drive]] [[station wagon]]&lt;ref name="EdmundsBodyStyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/new/2007/chevrolet/hhr/100759599/comparelanding.html|title=Chevrolet HHR Compare Competitive Models|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=[[Edmunds.com|Edmunds]]|quote=''4dr Wagon''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNAutosBodyStyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/category/default.aspx?category=wagons|title=Research Station Wagons|accessdate=2007-08-22|publisher=[[MSN Autos]]|quote=''Station Wagons...

The HHR shares the [[GM Delta platform]] with the [[Chevrolet Cobalt]], [[Pontiac G5]], and [[Saturn Ion]]. In Mexico, it was marketed with its predecessor, the [[Opel]]-sourced [[Chevrolet Zafira]] [[compact MPV]].

Chevrolet marketed a [[panel van]] variant of the HHR beginning in 2007.  Assembled in [[Ramos Arizpe]], Mexico and marketed throughout North America, production of the HHR ended in May 2011.

== Design ==
The vehicle's design was inspired by the late-1940s/early 1950s Chevrolet cars and trucks, specifically the 1947 [[Chevrolet Suburban#Fourth generation (1947–1955)|Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Chevrolet Advance Design|Advance Design]] pickups, with large, square fender flares and a hemispherical grille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= |title= 2006 Chevrolet HHR LT|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOpLPppyTP0|access-date= July 6, 2018|archive-url= |archive-date= |format=[[YouTube]] |time=5:44 to 6:36 |location= |publisher= Regular Car Reviews|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the HHR has been credited to [[Bryan Nesbitt]] who was a former designer at [[Chrysler]] where he was the lead designer of the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]].&lt;ref name="HHRviaCNN" /&gt; Nesbitt was recruited by GM to join its design staff and served for a time as the chief designer of the Chevrolet brand. The HHR had a cargo-carrying capacity of {{convert|62.7|cuft|m3}}. All models had a flat-load floor (passenger models have 60/40 split bench) and fold-flat front passenger seat. For the 2007 model year, it was available in five trim levels; LS, LT, 2LT, and Special Edition. A [[panel van]] variant was also made available in 2007 for only the LT trim and became available on all trim levels in 2008.  A "Half Panel" (RPO code AA5) rear quarter window delete option was available from 2008-2010 model years.

== Assembly and sales ==
[[File:Chevrolet HHR 001.JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet HHR (Japanese version)]]
The HHR was assembled in [[Ramos Arizpe]], Mexico, and was available for sale throughout North America. The HHR was also exported to Japan by way of the motor vehicles business unit of [[Mitsui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automotive.mitsui.co.jp/hhr/index.html |title=HHR on Mitsui automotive site |publisher=Automotive.mitsui.co.jp |accessdate=2011-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612161652/http://www.automotive.mitsui.co.jp/hhr/index.html |archivedate=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese buyers were liable for annual taxes due to the engine displacement and width dimensions which didn't comply with the "compact class" [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] imposed by the Japanese Government. First year sales exceeded 93,000 through June 2006.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The HHR was partially available in Europe and is replaced now by the Chevrolet Orlando. In early 2009, the Chevrolet HHR was discontinued from the Mexican lineup due to poor sales.

== SS Turbocharged ==
[[File:'08 Chevrolet HHR SS.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Chevrolet HHR SS Turbocharged]]
In October 2006, Cheryl Catton, director of car marketing and retail integration for Chevy, confirmed that a high performance variant of the HHR would be built.&lt;ref name="SSacknowledged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/23/chevy-hhr-ss-acknowledged/ |title=Chevy HHR SS acknowledged |last=Lavrinc |first=Damon |accessdate=2007-06-11 |date=2006-10-02 |publisher=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was expected to be released with [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]] moniker for the 2008 model year and use the [[Ecotec LNF]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine found in the [[Pontiac Solstice]] GXP and [[Saturn Sky]] Red Line.

On August 16, 2007, Chevrolet officially revealed the 2008 Chevrolet HHR SS Turbocharged at the [[Woodward Dream Cruise]] in [[Birmingham, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="SSintro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/17/video-woodward-live-reveal-of-the-2008-chevy-hhr-ss/|title=Woodward: Live Reveal of the 2008 Chevy HHR SS|accessdate=2007-08-17|last=Abuelsamid|first=Sam|date=2007-08-17|publisher=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiveReveal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/cars/woodward-dream-cruise/live-from-the-woodward-dream-cruise-its-the-chevy-hhr-ss-reveal-290386.php |title=Live From The Woodward Dream Cruise, It's The Chevy HHR SS Reveal! |accessdate=2007-08-16 |last=Wert |first=Ray |date=2007-08-16 |publisher=[[Jalopnik]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by GM's Performance Division and introduced as a 2008 model in the fall of 2007. The SS Turbocharged features a {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Ecotec LNF]] [[Straight-4|I4]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] and intercooler that produces {{convert|260|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} ({{convert|235|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} with the optional 4-speed automatic), race-tuned high-performance suspension, five-speed [[manual transmission]] with short-throw shifter, standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes, ground effects with unique front and rear fascias, aggressive black cross-mesh grille, liftgate-mounted aero spoiler, an analog A-pillar-mounted titanium boost gauge, leather-wrapped steering wheel with mounted audio controls, and unique {{convert|18|in|mm|abbr=on}} high-polished aluminum wheels.

Chevrolet also introduced the '''HHR SS Panel Concept''' on October 30, 2007 at the 2007 [[SEMA]] Show.&lt;ref name="JP-SSPanelConcept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/cars/sema/2009-chevy-hhr-ss-panel-sema-concept-315971.php|title=2009 Chevy HHR SS Panel SEMA Concept|accessdate=2007-10-30|date=2007-10-30|work=[[Jaloponik]]|publisher=General Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AB-SSPanelConcept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/10/30/sema-2007-chevy-hhr-panel-ss-delivers-smiles-at-sema/|title=Chevy HHR Panel SS delivers smiles at SEMA|accessdate=2007-10-30|last=Filipponio|first=Frank|date=2007-10-30|work=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]|publisher=General Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made into a production model for the 2009 model year.

The SS model was removed from the market after the 2010 model year due to the shuttering of the GM Performance Division, also known as the GM High Performance Vehicle Operations (HPVO) Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/2011-gm-order-guide-changes-for-chevrolet-camaro-corvette-hhr-malibu-cadillac-sts/ |title=2011 GM Order Guide: Changes for Chevrolet Camaro, Corvette, HHR, Malibu; Cadillac STS - Car and Driver Blog |publisher=Blog.caranddriver.com |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, GM phased out all GM badges from the front doors for the 2010.5 model year, including the Chevrolet HHR.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the fourth quarter of 2010, Chevrolet announced that the HHR would be discontinued after the 2011 model year, with the last HHR's available in dealerships starting in late January to early February.  HHRs were also available for fleet order until May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Good Chevrolet |url=http://www.prlog.org/11024409-chevrolet-discontinues-the-hhr.html |title=Chevrolet Discontinues the HHR |publisher=PRLog |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Year-to-year changes ==
[[File:Chevrolet HHR panel rear -- 03-10-2010.jpg|thumb|Panel Van]]
* 2007: HHR Panel launched. Intended for commercial use, the rear side windows &amp; rear seat are deleted &amp; additional floor storage is offered.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2008-chevrolet-hhr-hhr-ss-review|title=2008 Chevrolet HHR / HHR SS|work=Car and Driver|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2.4 LE5 engine was retuned for more power while retaining the same [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. The 2.2L L61 engine received some significant internal upgrades including a higher-strength Gen II block and revised cylinder head (enlarged exhaust ports) and camshaft design (increased exhaust valve duration). The engine also switched from [[wasted spark]] ignition to individual [[Direct ignition|coil-on-plug]] ignition. Upgraded engine was controlled by new 32-bit ECM (E37).

Flex-Fuel (E85) was added to the 2.2 &amp; 2.4 engines for the 2009 model year; these were the first Four-Cylinder Flex-Fuel Engines from GM in North America.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/02/gm-introduces-f.html|title=GM Introduces Flex-Fuel Version of Chevrolet HHR; First Four-Cylinder Flex-Fuel Engine from GM in North America|website=Green Car Congress|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
In [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) tests the HHR received a "Good" overall score in the frontal offset crash test, and an "Acceptable" score in side impacts on models equipped with side curtain airbags.
Side curtain airbags became standard for 2008 models. However, side torso airbags were never made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=649 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chevrolet HHR |publisher=Iihs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Montana''' is a front wheel drive [[coupé utility]] sold by [[Chevrolet]] in [[Latin America]] and [[emerging markets]]. 

In [[Mexico]], the vehicle is known as '''Chevrolet Tornado''', because [[Pontiac]] had already used the Montana name for its [[Pontiac Montana|minivan offering]] for North America. The design of the first generation is a variation of the [[Opel Corsa]], essentially a pickup version of the [[Opel Combo]], while the second generation is based on the [[Chevrolet Agile]].

==First generation (2003–2010)==
[[File:2006 montana gls 1.7d.jpg|thumb|left|2003 Chevrolet Montana]]
The Montana used a 1.4 l "Ecoflex" and a 1.8 l 8V [[flex-fuel]] [[Straight-4|I4]] engines. In some markets like [[South Africa]] where it was sold as the Opel Corsa Utility until June 2010, the vehicle was offered with more engine options, but none flex fuel, like the 1.4 petrol and the 1.7 [[Isuzu]] [[turbodiesel]]. 

In 2007, the Montana was available in two versions: Montana Conquest and Montana Sport which had a slightly different design and set of accessories. The trunk can be loaded with up to {{convert|735|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} according to the manufacturer. 

This model was manufactured in [[São José dos Campos]], [[Brazil]], until 2010. In [[South Africa]], it was assembled from Brazilian supplied [[Complete knock down|CKD]] units.

===Mexico===
The Montana arrived in the model year of 2004, replacing the aged Corsa B based Chevy Pickup, but with the Tornado name tag, because the Pontiac Montana was available in Mexico at the time. 

It was based on the Chevrolet Corsa C and although the Corsa was dropped from the Mexican Chevrolet line up after the model year of 2008, the Tornado lived on for a few more years. It was the only car built in Brazil in the Mexican Chevrolet lineup.

===South Africa===
The second generation Corsa utility was released in 2003, and replaced the Corsa B Utility pickup. The vehicle was sold as the Opel Corsa Utility, until June 2010. From then on it was badged as the Chevrolet Corsa Utility but not for too long as Chevrolet had prepared to end this and also to stop representing Opel. It was available in a choice of three engine variations, namely 1.4 and 1.8 petrol engines, as well as a 1.7 turbodiesel. 

There were also three different trim levels available across the range: Base, Club and Sport.

==Second generation (2011–present)==
Despite short sales of the Chevrolet Corsa Utility in South Africa, Chevrolet had decided to replace the Corsa C Utility with the Agile Utility. It became known as the Montana, Tornado, or Utility, depending on the market.

The '''Chevrolet Corsica''' (named after [[Corsica]], [[France]]) is a [[front-wheel drive]] [[compact car]] that was produced by [[Chevrolet]] from 1987 to 1996. The Corsica was built upon the [[GM L platform|L-body]] platform. It shared the L-body with the 2-door [[Chevrolet Beretta|Beretta]], and the [[badge engineering|rebadged]] revival of the [[Pontiac Tempest]] which was essentially the same car, but was only sold in [[Canada]]. The Corsica came in two styles and four trims. Sold initially only as a 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]], it was also available as a 5-door [[hatchback]] from model years 1989 to 1991. Corsicas were built alongside the Beretta by both the [[Wilmington Assembly]] in [[Delaware]] and [[Linden Assembly]] in [[New Jersey]].

==Year-to-year changes==

===1987–1989===
The Corsica was first sold as a [[fleet car]] to rental agencies and large companies in 1987, prior to mainstream release.  The Corsica and [[Chevrolet Beretta|Beretta]] were the second best-selling cars in [[United States|America]] in 1988, right behind the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} Many Corsicas were also sold abroad, a few were sold in Europe, in the Netherlands for instance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Much of the suspension components were borrowed from the J-body [[Chevrolet Cavalier]], and the chassis was an extension of that of the J-body, but modeled with similar proportions to the N-body. The L-body platform however, was engineered by Chevrolet rather than Oldsmobile. The car was equipped with either the 2.0 L TBI OHV I4 from the Cavalier, or the 2.8 L MPFI OHV V6 from the Chevrolet Celebrity. The base Corsica's [[door handle]]s were colored silver, while the Corsica LT/LTZ had black-colored handles. Some earlier models had a column shifter with a handbrake between the front seats, an uncommon configuration for most compact cars of the time. A 5-door hatchback model was introduced for 1989, as was an LTZ performance package that included many suspension parts from the Beretta.  A rare XT trim included all the performance parts from the LTZ trim as well as a leather interior, special body kit and spoiler package designed for GM by a third party supplier.

===1990===
The base model Corsica was dropped, leaving the LT and LTZ. Both engines offered were increased in displacement. The Corsica now either used the same 2.2 L four-cylinder engine and 3-speed automatic transmission as the Cavalier, or the 3.1 L V6 and 3-speed automatic from the Lumina. Minor changes were made to the interior, mostly around the driver controls.

===1991===
For 1991 the Corsica received an extensively updated interior with a standard driver's side [[airbag]] and cup holders.  Front seatbelts were moved from the doors to the B-pillars. The taillights also received a redesign, from smooth to ridged. This would also be the last year for the 5-door hatchback.

===1992===
[[File:91-93 Chevrolet Corsica.jpg|thumb|right|1987–1989 Chevrolet Corsica LT]] [[File:Corsica Liftback.jpg|thumb|right|1989–1991 Chevrolet Corsica 5-door]]
The only trim level was the LT. The manual transmission was dropped for the V6; it remained available for the four-cylinder engine, although it was only available through special order (few of which ever took place{{cn|date=March 2018}}). The 2.2 L OHV engine was now upgraded with sequential fuel-injection (SFI) in the Corsica, unlike the version in the Cavalier which used multi-point fuel injection (MPFI).

===1993===
On automatic transmission vehicles, a shift interlock, which required the brake pedal to be applied before the transmission could be taken out of the park position, as well as a low oil level light was added. The 3.1 L V6 equipped cars also lost the "3.1L Multi-Port V6" fender badge.

===1994===
The LT model took the place of the base model once again. The 2.2 L engine's power output was increased to 120 hp. The 3.1 L V6 was replaced with the updated ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation III|Gen III]]'' "3100-series" [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] (Option code [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#L82|L82]]) with an output of 160 hp along with an OBD-1.5 System. This new OBD system was not compatible with either OBD-I or OBD-II but included some features from both systems.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

The air conditioning System was now upgraded to use R134 refrigerant, as opposed to environmentally-harmful Freon.

The 3-speed automatic transmission on V6 models was replaced with a 4-speed electronically-controlled [[automatic transmission]] with overdrive, and lubricated with 100,000 mile long-life fluid. The 2.2 L engine retained the same 3-speed automatic, but the 4-speed automatic could be special ordered. The front seat belts were moved from the B-pillars to the doors. The manual transmission was also dropped for all US Corsicas this model year, due to lack of consumer demand, although many export models and the Beretta still retained this option.

===1995===
[[File:95-96 Chevrolet Corsica.jpg|thumb|left|1995–1996 Chevrolet Corsica]]
The Corsica became the first American car to be equipped with [[daytime running light]]s as a standard feature.  A new Corsica logo was introduced along with other minor cosmetic exterior changes, such as the introduction of body-colored mirrors, side moldings, and grille. The car also received a revised rear suspension, similar to that of the then-newly redesigned Cavalier. This slightly reduced the "floatiness" of the ride which occurred with earlier models. All Corsicas now came with Dex-Cool engine coolant. The car also received a new tire size, 195/70R14 for longer tire life and better handling.

===1996===
The Corsica was converted fully to OBD-II. GM discontinued the Corsica and the [[Chevrolet Beretta]] after the 1996 model year, due to safety standards in 1997 that would have required a total redesign of these cars, and competition from the redesigned similarly sized 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier for compact car sales. The Corsica was replaced by the larger [[Chevrolet Malibu]] for the 1997 model year.

Production ended on June 26, 1996.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Notes:
*Both the 2.8 L [[V6]] and 2.0 L [[Straight-4|I4]] received a longer stroke [[crankshaft]] in the 1990 model year, respectively increasing their displacements to 3.1 L and 2.2 L.
*In the 1992 model year, sequential fuel injection replaced throttle-body injection on the I4 and in 1994 it replaced MPFI on the V6 models.  The updated OBD system is sometimes referred to as OBD 1.5.

The '''Chevrolet Delray''', named after [[Delray Beach, Florida]], debuted in 1954 as an optional trim level on two-door models of [[Chevrolet]]'s mid-range [[Chevrolet 210|210 series]] of cars. In 1958, it became a distinct series of its own at the bottom of Chevy's lineup (replacing the discontinued 150), and added a four-door sedan, and sedan delivery, but it only remained in production for that model year.

The first year for Delray was the final year for the 1949-1954 style Chevys. For 1954 the 210 series was shortened considerably, losing its hardtop coupe and convertible but adding the Delray club coupe.

===1954===
The chassis and mechanical parts were common with the rest of the passenger car range, and the overall appearance was the same as the rest of the range. Front suspension was independent, named "knee-action".&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1951"/&gt; This year marked the end of the "Blue Flame" [[straight-six engine]] as the top engine before the introduction of the small block V8 in 1955; and 1954 was also the last year for six-volt electrical systems in Chevrolet vehicles.

====Engines====
Two engines were used in the 1954 model year, with the more powerful Blue Flame unit used with the Powerglide [[automatic transmission]]. All 210s had a three-speed [[synchromesh]] [[manual transmission]] as standard, with two optional transmissions. All engines were of an overhead valve (OHV) design. They are commonly referred to as "stovebolt sixes" because of the large slotted-head screws used to fasten the valve cover and pushrod covers to the block.

For the [[Tri-Five]] years the Delray was essentially an interior option package for the plain 210 two door sedan. It featured an upgraded vinyl upholstery with "waffle-like" pleating, color-keyed to the exterior, along with carpeting and other minor upgrades.

===1955===
The 1955 model year marked the introduction of a new chassis and the debut of the Chevrolet's well-received [[small block]] V8. The center door frame was strengthened for more safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure/1955%20Chevrolet%20Prestige-16-17.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brakes were {{convert|11|in|mm|sing=on}} drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure/1955%20Chevrolet%20Prestige-18-19.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 210 buyer was free to choose any Chevy powertrain option. The ammeter and oil pressure gauges were changed to warning lights.

The 210, including the Delray, shared the wedge-shaped side trim with the Bel Air, but unlike the Bel Air (which had the wedge filled with an aluminum trim panel) the 210's wedge was painted either body color, or top color with the optional two-tone paint package.  "Chevrolet" in script was mounted inside the wedge.

In 1958, the Delray became a distinct series of its own, taking the place of the [[Chevrolet 150|150]]. The Delray was Chevrolet's price-leading, no-frills model, with the more expensive models being the [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]], [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] (the last being a sub-model of the Bel Air for 1958). It now had GM's X-frame.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Foldout/1958%20Chevrolet%20Foldout-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came in a utility coupe, a two-door coupe, a four-door sedan. The Delray's 1958 only four-door or two-door station wagon counterpart was the [[Chevrolet Yeoman]].&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures2"/&gt;

===1958===
For 1958, Chevrolet models were redesigned longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors. The first production Chevrolet big block V8, the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#348|{{convert|348|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]], was now an option. 
Chevrolet's design for the year fared better than its other [[General Motors|GM]] offerings {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, and lacked the abundance of chrome found on Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs. Complementing Chevrolet's front design was a broad grille and quad headlights that helped portray a 'baby Cadillac'; the wagon's tail received a fan-shaped alcove on both side panels, similar to the sedan's, but wagons housed single tail lights instead of dual (triple on Impalas) to accommodate the tailgate.
Despite being a recession year, consumers made Chevrolet the top make of automobile (beating Ford, which held the title in 1957) and the Bel Air was at the core of Chevrolet's popularity. With its wide variety of body styles and models, Bel Airs could be optioned with almost every conceivable luxury within the Chevrolet line. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle bowed as the premium four-door Chevrolet [[station wagon]], lacking the unique styling of the 1955-1957 Nomads. Most Chevrolet station wagon models had two tail lights housed in abbreviated alcoves, which were made smaller to accommodate the rear gate. A new dash was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1958%20Chevrolet%20Guide-04.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of a drag coefficient for 1958 Chevy wagons as estimated by a-c, is 0.6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.automobile-catalog.com/make/chevrolet_usa/full-size_chevrolet_5gen/full-size_del_ray_wagon/1958.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1958 Chevrolet Delray Sedan Delivery.jpg|250px|left|thumb|1958 Chevrolet Delray 2-door sedan delivery]]

Befitting its bottom-end status, the Delray had minimal interior and exterior trim and limited options. As such, this model was popular with fleet buyers such as police departments and businesses. However, private customers could also buy a Delray if low price, economy and basic all-around transportation with the convenience of a full-size automobile were the primary goals.

====Engines====
Buyers could order any engine and transmission choice, including the new 348 [[V8 engine|V8]] (1958 was the first year for Chevrolet's "big block" V8) and the [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] 283 V8 engines.

====Safety====
Like the rest of Chevrolet's 1958 full size car line up, the Yeoman featured Chevrolet's new "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these "x-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons/1958%20Chevrolet%20Wagons-06-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1958-chevrolet.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Brookwood''' is a series of [[Full-size car|full-size]] [[station wagon]]s produced by [[Chevrolet]] from 1958 to 1961, and again from 1969 to 1972. It debuted in 1958 as Chevrolet's mid-range model in its station wagon lineup, positioned between the less expensive [[Chevrolet Yeoman|Yeoman]] and more luxurious [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]] station wagons. After the Yeoman was discontinued in 1959, the Brookwood was subsequently demoted to entry-level status, before going out of production altogether in 1961. It made a brief reappearance from 1969 and 1972, once again as the least-expensive wagon in Chevrolet's lineup.

Introduced in 1958 as Chevrolet's mid-priced station wagon, Brookwoods were trimmed in line with Chevrolet's mid-priced [[Chevrolet Biscayne]] models. The Brookwood offered for the 1958 model year was a 4-door station wagon, available in either six- or nine-passenger models.

=== Design ===
[[File:Flickr - DVS1mn - 58 Chevrolet Brookwood (6).jpg|thumb|left|1958 Chevrolet Brookwood (rear)]]
For 1958, Chevrolet models were redesigned longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors. The first ever production Chevrolet big block V8, the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#348|{{convert|348|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]], was now an option.

Despite being a recession year, consumers made Chevrolet the No. 1 make of automobile (beating Ford, which held the title in 1957) and the Bel Air was at the core of Chevrolet's popularity. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle bowed as the premium four-door Chevrolet [[station wagon]], lacking the unique styling of the 1955-57 Nomads. A new dash was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1958%20Chevrolet%20Guide-04.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of a drag coefficient for 1958 Chevy wagons is estimated by a-c, is Cd = 0.6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.automobile-catalog.com/make/chevrolet_usa/full-size_chevrolet_5gen/full-size_del_ray_wagon/1958.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As Chevrolet's mid-range wagon ===
For its first year, Chevrolet's 6 and 9-passenger Brookwood wagons replaced 1957 [[Chevrolet 210]] Townsman 6-passenger 4-door wagon and 1957 Chevrolet 210 Beauville 9-passenger 4-door wagon as their mid-range station wagon model between their plainer 1958 only [[Chevrolet Yeoman|Yeoman]] and the now 4-door only top-of-the-line [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]]. Like the 1958 Nomad, the 1958 Brookwood was also  4-door only. The next year Brookwood would become the base model wagon and offer a 2-door effectively replacing Yeoman.
Buyers could order any engine and transmission choice, including the 348 [[V8 engine|V8]] and the [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] 283 V8 engines.

For the second time in as many years, Chevrolet again came up with a totally new car. From the front or rear the 1959 Chevrolets resembled nothing else on the road. From the headlights, placed as low as the law would allow, to the cats-eye tail lights, the 1959 Chevrolet was a brand new car with all new sheet metal. The most visual new change was the flat, wing shaped tailfins.&lt;ref name="flory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. "Kelly"|title=American Cars, 1946–1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was built on a {{convert|119|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[wheelbase]] and was {{convert|211|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} long-which was {{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer than the 1957 model. This made Chevrolet the longest car in the low-priced range, whereas two years before it had been the shortest. In addition, the car was {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} wider outside and had {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} more width inside than it did in 1958, through the reduction of door thickness. The GM X frame had no side rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure/1959%20Chevrolet-22.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers matching the car series. Chevrolet eliminated its entry-level [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]]-based Yeoman models and the Biscayne-based Brookwood became Chevrolet's least expensive wagon models. Brookwoods were now available in two-door or four-door body styles, both in six-passenger configuration only. The new Parkwood 6-passenger and new Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air's model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and higher compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. The Nomad was still the top Chevy wagon. A parking brake warning light was optional. Under the hood, little change took place for '59 Chevys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1959%20Chevrolet%20Manual-04.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1960 Chevrolet Brookwood rear.jpg|thumb|205px|left|1960 Chevrolet Brookwood (rear)]]
Few alterations were made for 1960. The new models were refinements of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, the return of the double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling "cat's eyes" of 1959. Under the hood, things remained constant. Fuel injection was no longer available, but with the 348 cubic inch engine, a horsepower rating of 335 at 5800&amp;nbsp;rpm was now achieved. This involved the use of three double-barrel carburettors, a special cam and an 11.25:1 compression ratio, all sold as a package.

=== 2-door variant ===
Like the 1958 Yeoman 2-door. The 1959 &amp; '60 Brookside 2-doors, are preferred by hotrodders and collectors over their 4-door counterparts. The two-door variant would become the basis for the new-for-1959 [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].  Unlike the Brookwood, the El Camino could be ordered in trim levels corresponding to the entire full-sized car line including the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]]. 1960 marked the end of Chevy's full size 2-door wagons, and the end of 2-door Chevy wagons all together until the 1964 Chevelle 300 2-door wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russoandsteele.com/collector-car/1958-Chevrolet-Yeoman/5626 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313122143/http://www.russoandsteele.com/collector-car/1958-Chevrolet-Yeoman/5626 |archivedate=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrolet's 1959 &amp; '60 Brookwood (as well as the rest of Chevy's full size line up) still featured Chevrolet's "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame introduced in '58. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these "x-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member.&lt;ref name="Oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt; This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt;

For 1961, full size Chevrolets again had a totally new body, not just new sheet metal. Its wheelbase remained {{convert|119|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, but its length was now reduced slightly to {{convert|209.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}.
All engines options of the previous year remained in effect with the standard engines being the 235.5 CID Six of {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or the 283 CID V8 of {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The V8 cost $110 more than the Six and weighed {{convert|5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less. In 1961, the two-door body style was dropped, but the nine-passenger model returned. GM discontinued the Chevrolet Brookwood name for 1962, instead naming their station wagons after their series names: [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]], [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]].

=== Safety ===
Chevrolet's 1961 Brookwood (as well as all other full size Chevrolets) featured a shortened version of Chevrolet's "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame introduced in '58. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these "x-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member.&lt;ref name="Oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt; This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.&lt;ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/&gt;

=== Discontinuation and replacement ===
GM discontinued the Chevrolet Brookwood wagon nameplate (as well as the Parkwood and Nomad wagon names) for 1962, instead naming their station wagons after their series names: [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]] (replacing Brookwood directly), [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]]. The 1962-'64 Biscayne, Bel Air, and Impala wagons were very similar to Chevy's 1961 wagon models.

In 1969, each Chevrolet station wagon regained its own unique model name. Brookwood, again related to the Biscayne, was assigned to the least expensive model, followed by the [[Chevrolet Townsman|Townsman]], [[Chevrolet Kingswood|Kingswood]] and [[Chevrolet Kingswood Estate|Kingswood Estate]] models. Brookwood models could be ordered with either [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine|six-cylinder]] or [[V8 engine]]s.

[[File:1972 Chevrolet Brookwood (3834554549).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Chevrolet Brookwood]]
[[File:1972 Chevrolet Brookwood.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Chevrolet Brookwood (rear)]]
1970 model Chevrolet full-size station wagons were nearly identical to the 1969 models, the biggest changes being the elimination of six-cylinder availability and the redesign of the front fascia, which did away with the previous year's loop bumper-grille assembly in favor of a more traditional front bumper and grille design.

In 1971 GM restyled its Chevrolet full-size models and all received GM's new [[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|clamshell tailgate]], marketed as the ''Glide-away'' tailgate &amp;mdash; also called a "disappearing" tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor.  The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate.  Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate.&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The '71 Wagons, Big Changes Coming Up |journal=Popular Science |date=October 1970 |pages=74–75 |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |first2=Jim |last2=Dunne |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22glide+away%22+tailgate#v=onepage&amp;q=%22glide%20away%22%20tailgate&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years.  Wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat &amp;mdash; and could accommodate a 4 x 8' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded.  The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door &amp;mdash; for example, in a closed garage.

Midway through the 1971 model year, all full-sized station wagons, including Brookwoods, received the previously optional [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] as standard equipment. Despite the series' economy roots and entry-level positioning, virtually all previous Brookwoods have been built and sold with an automatic transmission.

Brookwoods received Chevrolet's front fascia restyle in 1972 and could be ordered with any number of options from full wheel covers to a vinyl top. For 1972, GM listed a four-door Chevrolet sedan and the Brookwood in that year's Biscayne line.

=== End of production ===
For 1973, GM eliminated the Chevrolet Brookwood name in the United States, with the Bel Air, Impala and Caprice (the latter known as the Caprice Estate) nameplates continuing, replacing the previous Townsman, Kingswood and Kingswood Estate names, respectively.

In Canada, the Brookwood nameplate was gone, replaced by the Biscayne name, with both the wagon and its sedan mate continuing through the 1975 model year. Annual changes to the Biscayne wagon were identical to its more expensive bretheren. For instance, the 1975 models saw interior dashboard, climate control and radio graphics revised, and intermittent windshield wipers and a new econominder gauge package being offered as optional equipment.

From 1969 until 1972 the car was built at the [[Oshawa Car Assembly]] in [[Ontario]].

The '''Chevrolet Bel Air''' was a [[full-size car]] produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1950–1981 [[model year]]s. Initially only the two door hardtops in the Chevrolet model range were designated with the Bel Air name from 1950 to 1952, as distinct from the Styleline and Fleetline models for the remainder of the range. With the 1953 model year the Bel Air name was changed from a designation for a unique body shape to a premium level of trim applied across a number of body styles. The Bel Air continued with various other trim level designations until US production ceased in 1975. Production continued in [[Canada]], for its home market only, through the 1981 model year.

For 1950, Chevrolet came up with a revolutionary style that would set a pattern for decades. The Bel Air [[Hardtop]] was styled as a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] with a ''non-detachable'' solid roof. Models like this had been around since the 1920s, including early Chevrolets, with no degree of success. But the newly revised idea, sweeping the GM line from Chevrolet to [[Cadillac]], had finally found its era. First year production reached only 76,662 as buyers cautiously tested the revised concept. The car cost $1,741 and weighed {{convert|3225|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sixty years of Chevrolet by George H. Dammann&lt;/ref&gt; Front suspension was independent, named "knee-action".&lt;ref name= oldcarbrochures1951 /&gt;
[[File:53 Bel Air.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Chevrolet Bel Air Convertible]] The first Bel Airs of this era shared only their front sheet metal ahead of the [[A pillar]] with the rest of the range. The windshield, doors, glass, and trunk were common with the Styline DeLuxe Convertible Coupe, however the roof, rear quarters and rear windows (3) were unique. The chassis and mechanicals were common with the rest of the passenger car range, and the overall appearance was the same as the rest of the range, except that the roof line was lower and the unique three piece rear window gave it a longer and more balanced look. The first Bel Airs were only available with the "DeLuxe" premium trim level and specification.

Apart from the usual annual grille and trim changes, the 1951–1952 Bel Air differed from the earlier 1950 model with introduction of the higher and squarer rear guards that were across the whole range.

In 1953 Chevrolet renamed its series, and the Bel Air name was applied to the premium model range. Two lower series, the [[Chevrolet 150|150]] and [[Chevrolet 210|210]], also emerged (as successors to the Special and Deluxe series, respectively). The 1953 Chevrolet was advertised as "Entirely new through and through," due to the restyled body panels, front and rear ends. However, essentially these Chevrolets had similar frame and mechanicals to the 1949–1952 cars.

The 1953–1954 Chevrolet range had a unique and somewhat awkward look about it and much of this stemmed from its role as a transitional model to introduce a raft of changes that were necessary to pave the way for the introduction of the 1955–1957 range that really established the Bel Air as a cultural icon. The pre-war technology, such as torque tube drive, six-cylinder splash feed engines, knee action suspension, split windshields, etc., of the early models was phased out and the foundations for the first post war modern Chevrolet passenger car were finalized in this 1953–1954 model. The Bel Air series featured a wide chrome strip of molding from the rear fender bulge to the rear bumper. The inside of this stripe was painted a coordinating color with the outside body color, and "Bel Air" scripts were added inside the strip. Lesser models had no model designation anywhere on the car, only having a Chevy crest on the hood and trunk. 1953 was the first year for a curved, one-piece windshield.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet_Brochure/1953%20Chevrolet-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher= Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate= 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the July 1953 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', a tested 1953 Bel Air went from 0-60mph in 19.6 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Owners Report on the 53 Chevrolet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 March 2020 |work=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bel Air interiors had an optional massive expanse of chrome across the lower part of the dashboard (most were painted), along with a deluxe Bel Air steering wheel with full chrome horn ring. Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights, and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954.  Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI. During these years, there were three engine choices, depending on the transmission ordered. Both 235 cubic inch engines were "Blue Flame" [[Straight-six engine|inline six]] cylinder [[OHV]] engines, featuring hydraulic valve lifters (in 1953 with automatic transmissions) and aluminum pistons. The {{convert|106|hp|abbr=on}} 235 cubic inch displacement engine was standard on [[stickshift]] models, with solid lifters and splash plus pressure lubrication including babbit bearings. [[Powerglide]] cars got a {{convert|115|hp|abbr=on}} version which had hydraulic lifters and full pressure lubrication.

[[File:1954 Chevrolet Bel Air 2.-Door HT LRW466.jpg|thumb|left|1954 Chevrolet Bel Air 2-door Hardtop]]
In 1953 and 1954, Bel Airs could be ordered in convertible, hardtop coupe, two- and four-door sedans, and, for 1954, the [[Chevy Beauville|Beauville]] station wagon which featured woodgrain trim around the side windows. Many new options, once available only to more expensive luxury cars, became offered starting in 1953, including power steering and the [[Headlamp#Automatic beam switching|Guidematic headlight dimmer]] in 1953; and power brakes, power 2-way front seat and power front windows in 1954. All 1954 models equipped with the standard transmission used the 1953 Powerglide engine.

For 1955, Chevrolet's [[full-size]] model received all new styling and power. The 1955 Bel Air was {{convert|3456|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|ft|abbr=on}} long. It was called the "Hot One" in GM's advertising campaign. Chevrolet's styling was crisp, clean and incorporated a Ferrari-inspired grille. Bel Airs came with features found on cars in the lower models ranges plus interior carpet, chrome headliner bands on hardtops, chrome spears on front [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]], [[stainless steel]] window moldings,&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; and full [[wheel cover]]s. Models were further distinguished by the Bel Air name script in gold lettering later in the year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946"/&gt; For 1955 Chevrolets gained a [[V8 engine]] option and the option of the 2 speed [[Powerglide]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], or a standard three speed Synchro-Mesh [[manual transmission]] with optional [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]]. The new [[Chevrolet small-block engine#265|{{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] featured a modern, [[overhead valve]] high [[compression ratio]], short [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] design that was so good that it remained in production in various [[Engine displacement|displacements]] for many decades. The base V8 had a two-barrel [[carburetor]] and was rated at {{convert|162|hp|0|abbr=on}} and the "Power Pack" option featured a four-barrel carburetor and other upgrades yielding {{convert|180|bhp|0|abbr=on}}. Later in the year, a "Super Power Pack" option added high-compression and a further {{convert|15|bhp|0|abbr=on}}. "Idiot" lights replaced gauges for the generator and [[Oil pressure gauge|oil pressure]].&lt;ref name= autogenerated1991&gt;{{cite book| title=Consumer Guide Chevrolet 1955–1957|year=1991|publisher=Publications International|isbn=1-56173-311-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the first Chevrolet to be installed with a V8 engine. The first Chevrolet with a V8 engine was introduced in 1917 called the [[Chevrolet Series D|Series D]] which was built for two years, and was manufactured before Chevrolet joined [[General Motors]].

[[Motor Trend|''Motor Trend'' magazine]] gave the Bel Air top marks for handling.&lt;ref name= autogenerated1991 /&gt; ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' reported acceleration for a V8 Bel Air with [[Powerglide]] as being 0-{{cvt|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 12.9 seconds, plus a comfortable ride and good visibility. On the other hand, the horn ring blocked some of the speedometer, regular gasoline made the engine knock and the first V8 engines off the line burned too much oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front legroom was 43.1".&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Brakes were 11" drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure/1955%20Chevrolet%20Prestige-18-19.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new option for V8-equipped 1955 models was [[air conditioning]], with outlets on each side of the dashboard; a [[Heavy duty battery|heavy-duty generator]] was included on cars equipped with this option; in 1955 and 1956, air conditioning could be installed on cars ordered with the standard three-speed manual transmission, overdrive or Powerglide, but from 1957 onward, an automatic transmission (or minus that, 4-speed manual transmission) was a pre-requisite option.

The 1956 Bel Air received a face-lift with a more conventional full-width grille, pleasing those customers who didn't favor the [[Ferrari]]-inspired '55 front end. Distinctive two-tone bodyside treatments and graceful front and rear wheel openings completed the "speedline" restyling. Single housings incorporated the [[taillight]], stoplight, and backup light, and the left one held the gas filler - an idea popularized on [[Cadillac]]s. Among the seven Bel Air models was a new Sport Sedan, a pillarless four-door hardtop that looked handsome with all the windows rolled down and allowed easy entry into the back seat. Production exceeded 103,000, compared to 128,000 two-door hardtops. Shapely two-door Nomad wagons topped the price chart at $2,608, but now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheetmetal as other Bel Airs, lacking the original's unique trim. Only 7,886 were built. The least costly Bel Air, at $2,025, was the two-door sedan. [[Seatbelts]], shoulder harnesses, and a padded dashboard were available,&lt;ref name= autogenerated1991/&gt; and full-size cars could even get the hot [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] 225-horsepower engine. In 1956 sales material there was an optional rain-sensing automatic top,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet_Accessories/1956%20Chevrolet%20Acc-05.html |title= Directory Index: Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet_Accessories |website= Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first seen on the 1951 LaSabre concept car.

From 1955 to 1957, production of the two-door [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]] [[station wagon]] was assigned to the Bel Air series, although its body and trim were unique to that model. Prior to becoming a regular production model, the Nomad first appeared as a Corvette-based concept vehicle in 1954. Chevrolet has since unveiled two concept cars bearing the Nomad name, most recently in 1999. The 1955–1957 Chevrolets are commonly referred to as [[Tri Five]]s.

The 1955-1957s were made in right-hand drive and shipped from [[Oshawa Car Assembly|Oshawa]], Canada, for local assembly in Australia (CKD), New Zealand (SKD) and South Africa. All three model years had a reversed version of the '55 LHD dashboard and did not get the LHD models' 1957 redesign.

A black 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air was featured in the 1973 movie ''[[American Graffiti]].'' In the movie, the car is driven by the character Bob Falfa, played by [[Harrison Ford]]. The 55" features a big hood scoop, and a signature cowboy hat in the rear window. The 55" races against a yellow [[1932 Ford|1932 Ford Deuce Coupe,]] and crashes into a ditch. The Bel Air had a 454 cubic inch chevrolet motor, with aluminum heads, tunnel ram intake and dual Holley carburetors.

For 1958, Chevrolet models were redesigned longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors, and the first ever production Chevrolet big block V8, the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#348|{{convert|348|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]], was now an option. The Bel Air gained a halo vehicle in 1958, the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], available only as a hardtop coupe and convertible in its introductory year. Impala styling followed the basic lines of the other Chevrolet models but received special styling cues including a different roof line, a vent above the rear window, unique side trim, and triple tail lights housed in slightly broader alcoves. For the budget conscious, the [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]], (formerly the 210) and the [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]] (formerly the 150) completed this model year's family-oriented and utility offerings.

Chevrolet's design for the year fared better than its other [[General Motors|GM]] offerings, and lacked the overabundance of chrome found on Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs. Complementing Chevrolet's front design was a broad grille and quad headlights that helped simulate a 'Baby Cadillac'; the tail received a fan-shaped alcove on both side panels, which housed dual tail lights. Despite being a recession year, consumers made Chevrolet the No. 1 make of automobile (beating Ford, which held the title in 1957) and the Bel Air was at the core of Chevrolet's popularity. With its wide variety of body styles and models, Bel Airs could be optioned with almost every conceivable luxury within the Chevrolet line. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle bowed as the premium four-door Chevrolet [[station wagon]], lacking the unique styling of the 1955-57 Nomads. Most Chevrolet station wagon models had two tail lights (one on each side of the body) housed in abbreviated alcoves, which were made smaller to accommodate the rear gate. A new dash was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1958%20Chevrolet%20Guide-04.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |website= Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate= 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safety====
Like the rest of Chevrolet's 1958 full size car line up, the Bel Air featured Chevrolet's new "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine.  These "x-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons/1958%20Chevrolet%20Wagons-06-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons |website= Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate= 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.

For the first time, Powerglide models featured the "PRNDL" transmission selector arrangement, replacing the oft-critizied "PNDLR" quadrant that many considered confusing at best, dangerous at worst.

'''Appearances''' 

A white 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air was featured in the 1973 movie ''[[American Graffiti]].'' The car is driven by the main character Steve. In the movie, the Bel Air disappears, and is later found outside of a junkyard.

For the second time in as many years, Chevrolet again came up with a totally new car. From the front or rear the 1959 Chevrolets resembled nothing else on the road. From the headlights, placed as low as the law would permit, to the cat's-eye tail lights, the 1959 Chevrolet was a brand new car with all new sheet metal, a new frame, and even new series names. The most visual new change was the flat, wing shaped tailfins.&lt;ref name= flory2008 /&gt; The car was built on a {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[wheelbase]] and was {{convert|211|in|mm|abbr=on}} long-which was {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer than the 1957 model. This made Chevrolet the longest car in the low-priced range, whereas two years before it had been the shortest. In addition, the car was {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} wider outside and had {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} more width inside than it did in 1958, through the reduction of door thickness. The "X" frame from 1958 was continued, but enlarged and strengthened to support the new body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure/1959%20Chevrolet-22.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure |website= Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate= 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bel Air, which had been the top line series since 1953, was now the middle range. Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers matching the car series. Parkwood 6-passenger and Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air's model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. Under the hood, little change took place. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. Bel Air production was 447,100. The new [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] ''line'' surpassed Bel Air production by 20,000 units. A parking brake warning light was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1959%20Chevrolet%20Manual-04.html|title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little change was made for 1960. The new models were refinements of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, the return of the double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling "cat's eyes" of 1959. Under the hood, things remained constant. Fuel injection was no longer available, but with the 348 cubic inch engine, a horsepower rating of 335 at 5800&amp;nbsp;rpm was now achieved. This involved the use of three double-barrel carburettors, a special cam and an 11.25:1 compression ratio, all sold as a package. Body style offerings followed 1959, with hardtops and sedans available.  The convertible was reserved for the Impala series.  The Bel Air Sport Sedan continued to use a rear window overhang and a huge wraparound rear window. Bel Airs (and Biscaynes) had two tail lights per side; the Impalas had three tail lights per side—a situation that would persist for most years through 1975. Many of the same options and accessories that were available on the Impala were also available on the Bel Air. The Bel Airs had more interior and exterior brightwork than the Biscayne.

For 1961, Chevrolet again had a totally new body, not just new sheetmetal. Its wheelbase remained {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on}}, but its length was now reduced slightly to {{convert|209.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}.
All engines options of the previous year remained in effect with the standard engines being the 235.5 CID Six of {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or the 283 CID V8 of {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The V8 cost $110 more than the Six and weighed {{convert|5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less.

The Bel Air 2-door sedan used squared-off roof styling and large wrap-around rear window as opposed to the hardtop's swept-back design. The Bel Air 4-door Sport Hardtop still used a different roof line than did the 4-door sedan.

For 1962, all sheetmetal except the door panels was changed. Overall length was stretched slightly to {{convert|209.6|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The 4-door Sport Hardtop was no longer offered in the Bel Air series. Standard engines remained the same as the previous year. A new [[Chevrolet small-block engine#327|{{convert|327|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] V8 of 250 or {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} was offered in addition to the giant (for the time) [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#409|{{convert|409|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] V8 of {{convert|380|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|409|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with the dual four-barrel carburetor setup. All wagons this year were 4-door models and separate distinctions for wagons were dropped. Now all models were either Biscayne, Bel Air or Impala series. Full carpeting returned as standard equipment on all 1962 Bel Air models for the first time in several years.  The Bel Air Sport Coupe was in its last year of U.S. production, and its roofline was a carryover from the 1961 hardtop coupe.

For 1963, the full size Chevrolet received little more than a facelift. Overall length increased to {{convert|210.4|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Replacing the older 235 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine as standard equipment was a new 230 cubic-inch six-cylinder of more modern design with a 140-horsepower rating that was based on the 194 cubic-inch six introduced on the compact [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevy II Nova]] the previous year. The base V8 remained the 283 CID, which was upgraded to produce {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The 409 CID V8 was now offered in 340, 400 and {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}} versions, while the small block 327 V8 continued with options of 250 and 300 horsepower. The Bel Air continued to be Chevrolet's middle range, but it now consisted of only two car models- the 2-door sedan and the 4-door sedan. 6 and 9-passenger Bel Air station wagons were again offered.
[[File:64 Bel Air.jpg|thumb|left|1964 Chevrolet Bel Air 2-door Sedan]]

For 1964, very few changes were made except the expected sheet metal and trim renovations. Cars were {{convert|209.9|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length while the wagons were {{convert|210.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} long. In addition to the un-changed standard engines, there were two different 327 CID engines were offered, developing from {{convert|250|hp|kW|abbr=on}} to {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and three 409 CID engines ranging from {{convert|340|hp|kW|abbr=on}} to {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Except for a chrome belt line and $100 difference in price there was little exterior difference between the Bel Air and Biscayne version.

RHD Bel Airs continued to be imported into Australia.  Some of these cars featured a reversed 1961 Pontiac instrument panel, but others had a mirror image of the more attractive current North American panel.  Even more curious was the fact that some of these Bel Airs featured Impala-style triple taillights; the center lens was amber in keeping with Australian legal standards.

For 1965, the full size Chevrolet was totally restyled, and the cars were stretched to {{convert|213.3|in|mm|abbr=on}} overall, even though the wheelbase remained the same. The new stamped grille had a lower extension below the bumper which was slightly veed. Curved window glass and round taillights mounted high characterized the new styling. The interiors were also redesigned and a very attractive dash resulted. The standard V8 remained the 283 CID model of {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, but options included two new [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#396|{{convert|396|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] CID engines of {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and two 409 CID blocks of {{convert|400|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.

The Bel Air utilized a stainless-steel belt and rocker molding, identifying signature on the rear fenders, a glove compartment light and power tailgate on 9-passenger wagons to distinguish itself from the lower-priced Biscayne series.

[[File:1966 Chevrolet Bel Air, Leonora Airport, 2018 (01).jpg|thumb|left|1966 Chevrolet Bel Air 4-door Sedan]]
[[File:1966 Chevrolet Bel Air V8 Wagon Halloween.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Chevrolet Bel Air Wagon]]
For 1966, Chevrolet was in its second season of a totally new body change, so mild facelifting sufficed including forward thrusting, blunted front fenders and a revised grille. At the rear, a break with the traditional round taillamps took place. Bel Air and Biscayne featured dual rectangular lamps with back-up lamps built in. Overall length was {{convert|213.2|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The standard six-cylinder engine this year was the larger 250 CID version of {{convert|155|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. New for the speed set was a [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|{{convert|427|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] V8 of {{convert|390|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Bel Air was readily distinguishable from Biscayne by its full length body side molding and rear fender Bel Air signatures. All-vinyl interiors were now standard on station wagons while cloth and vinyl trims continued on sedans.

For 1967, full-sized Chevrolets featured a new body with bulging rear fenders, one of this year's styling trends, not necessarily appreciated by everyone. Bel Air 2 and 4-door Sedans continued in addition to 6 and 9-passenger wagons. This year Bel Air featured triple taillights unlike Biscayne's dual units. Standard engines remained the same as the previous year. Optional engines were a 327 CID V8 of {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the 396 CID V8 of {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}}; or the 427 CID V8 of {{convert|385|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, plus various speed packages.

[[File:Tuned '68 Chevrolet Bel Air (5eme picnic et BBQ '11 du club de Lowrider LuxuriouS Montréal).jpg|thumb|left|1968 Chevrolet Bel Air Coupe]]
For 1968, the Full-sized Chevrolets received some changes but were quite similar to the 1967 models, though they had grown one inch to {{convert|214.7|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Chevrolet's new grille design bore a strong resemblance to Cadillac's, but Bel Air's dual round taillight design was strictly Chevrolet. In an unusual move, the taillights were mounted in the bumper. In 1968 the U.S. additional safety features were required in all motor vehicles, bringing about a new standard in car safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/ |title=Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 - Occupant Crash Protection Passenger Cars |author=US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |date=January 1, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These features included shoulder belts for outboard front-seat occupants and side marker lights.  Chevys with optional V8s got the engine size, in cubic inches, displayed as part of the front side maker lights.

In addition to the 250 CID Six of {{convert|155|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, standard engines included the new [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] V8 of {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}}. The Bel Air with the standard 250 Six was capable of a top speed of {{convert|90|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|18.4|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} at cruising speeds. When powered by the new 307 CID V8, the Bel Air series cars had a top speed of {{convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|17.1|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} at cruising speeds.
[[File:69 Bel Air.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Chevrolet Bel Air 2-door Sedan]]

For 1969, the big Chevrolet was totally redesigned, given a new length, new fender and body lines, and a new front and back end, but continued using the basic 1965 chassis, innerbody structure and even the rooflines of pillared two- and four-door sedans. The cars also remained on the {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, but grew to a new length of {{convert|219.9|in|mm|abbr=on}}, while the wagons grew {{convert|4.3|in|mm|abbr=on}} to a new length of 217.7 Engine offerings included a standard 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder and {{convert|235|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 327 V-8, and optional V-8 engines included two 350s of {{convert|255|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, a 396 rated at {{convert|265|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and three 427 V8s of {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}}, {{convert|390|hp|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|425|hp|abbr=on}}. This was the final year for the Bel Air 2-door sedan and the Bel Air-based station wagon was renamed Townsman, as part of a Chevrolet move to revert to the pre-1962 practice of using different nameplates on station wagons than other models. Three- and four-speed manual transmissions were again offered along with the two-speed Powerglide automatic with the six-cylinder, and 327 and 350 V-8s; and the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic, offered only with the big-block V-8s since its 1965 introduction, was now available with all engines.

For 1970, the Chevrolet line was very little changed and regulated primarily to a new and very attractive front end. The standard Six was still the 250 of {{convert|155|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The standard V8 in full-size Chevrolets was now the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] of {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}}. Optional V-8 engines included a {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 350 and {{convert|265|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 400, with the top offering a [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|{{convert|454|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] of {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}}. The Bel Air series was now a one model 4-door sedan while the station wagon was again sold under the Townsman nameplate.

The 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].

[[File:1971 Bel Air.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Chevrolet Bel Air 4-Door Sedan in Police trim]]
By the late 1960s (with the introduction of the [[Chevrolet Caprice|Caprice]]), the Bel Air and its Biscayne stablemate were primarily marketed to automotive fleet customers. However, the Bel Air remained available to retail customers who sought a basic, no-frills, full-sized car that was better trimmed than the low-line Biscayne. When the Biscayne was discontinued after 1972, the Bel Air was demoted to the low-level model. Bel Airs again used two-segmented taillights as opposed to the triple-segmented lights of higher-level Impala and Caprice models, except in 1972 when all models shared the same triple-segmented lights mounted in the bumper.
[[File:72 Bel Air.jpg|left|thumb|1972 Chevrolet Bel Air 4-Door Sedan. The [[Chevrolet Impala (fifth generation)|1972 Impala]] Sedan shared the same body with the Bel Air Sedan]]
A 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine and three-speed [[manual transmission]] with column shift remained standard equipment through the 1973 model year on sedans with the 350 V8 and automatic standard on wagons—the Turbo Hydramatic [[automatic transmission|automatic]] had been the sole transmission choice on V-8-powered Bel Airs since the spring of 1971 though the old two-speed Powerglide was still offered with the six-cylinder engine through the 1972 model year. Only about 1,400 cars were built with the inline six in 1973. The engine and manual transmission were shelved by the end of the model year—marking the last full-size body-on-frame American car to offer a manual gearbox.

All Bel Air sedans built in 1974–1975 listed a 350 two-barrel [[V8 engine]] and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission as standard, with station wagons getting the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#400|{{convert|400|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]] four-barrel V8, again with Turbo-Hydramatic standard. The 400 V8 was optional on sedans and the 454 was available on both models.

With the discontinuation of the Bel Air two-door sedan after the 1969 model year, all U.S.-market Bel Airs sold between 1970 and 1975 were four-door [[sedan (car)|sedans]] or [[station wagon]]s—the latter carrying the Townsman nameplate from 1969 to 1972 and Bel Air from 1973 to 1975. However, a Bel Air hardtop coupe—based on the Impala Sport Coupe body—was sold in Canada from 1970 to 1975. This body even had a roofline similar to the original '66-67 Caprice coupe style for 1974–1975.

[[File:Chicago Illinois Police Chevrolet Bel Air (35346163012).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Chevrolet Bel Air Illinois police sedan]]

Most other changes to the Bel Air during its final years were identical to the more expensive Caprice and Impala lines, some of which were mandated by government safety regulations in the U.S. that included {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumpers in 1973 and similar-designed rear bumpers in 1974. The 1975 models had a new roofline and (along with the Impala) grille that was a direct copy of the 1974 Caprice front end. Inside, there were new instrument cluster markings, radio and climate control graphics (the speedometer read up to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour). Customers could buy their 1975 Bel Air with two new options: an Econominder gauge package (which included a gauge that monitored fuel economy, due in part to growing demands for fuel economy as well as a temperature gauge) and intermittent wipers.

In 1975, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' tested a Bel Air four-door sedan with the 350 V8 engine and Turbo Hydramatic against other U.S.-built full-sized cars of that period including the Pontiac Catalina, Ford LTD and Plymouth Gran Fury. Although the car performed well in its tests and placed second to the Pontiac, ''Consumer Reports'' pointed out the Bel-Air had less noise insulation and a less-comfortable rear seat than its higher-priced siblings, and that a comparably equipped Chevrolet Impala (with additional sound insulation, and upgraded upholstery and seat padding, a $203 premium over the Bel-Air) "would be even closer to the Pontiac in overall quality." Even so, the magazine stated that—for instance—the Bel-Air was "only slightly noisier than the Pontiac". ''Consumer Reports'' concluded in its report that prospective buyers should pay the extra $200 or so to upgrade to the costlier Impala, noting advantages such as greater resale value and interior-exterior appointments more comparable to the other tested full-sized vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;"Full-Sized Sedans: Pontiac, Chevrolet, Plymouth, Ford", ''Consumer Reports'', February 1975, pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Bel Airs for the U.S. were manufactured for 1975. For 1976, a lower-trimmed Impala "S" four-door sedan was a one-year offering which had less standard equipment than regular Impalas and functioned as a replacement for the Bel Air.

== Canada-only models ==
=== Bel Air Based Pontiacs ===
From 1954 through 1969, GM Canada produced a unique Bel Air-based Pontiac marketed as the Laurentian. While body panels resembled contemporary U.S. Pontiacs, the Canadian [[Pontiac Laurentian]] had the chassis, power train, wheelbase, even the interior (except for the instrument panel), of the Chevrolet Bel Air. These models were exported in SKD kit form in factory right hand drive to right hand drive markets, such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and locally assembled under the Pontiac marque. All RHD export ceased after 1968 at the behest of GM in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozgm.com/Ozstory.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early generations (1970–1976) ===
While the last Bel Air 2-door sedan was available in the United States in 1969, Chevrolet introduced a Canadian market-only two door hardtop, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, from 1970-75. Based on the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] Sport Coupe, this new model featured Bel Air trim at a lower price than the Impala. Each year through 1975, this model's body followed the design of the contemporary Impala Sport Coupe. The 4-door sedan and station wagon continued in production, identical to the U.S. models. For 1976, the Canadian Bel Air Coupe featured the same body as the Impala Custom Coupe, with the large fixed rear quarter window and frameless front door glass.

Unlike the United States, all 1976 Canadian full size Chevys (including the Bel Air) came with steel belted radial tires and an electric rear window defroster as standard equipment.  

Although the last Bel Air was produced in 1975 in the U.S., the Canadian big Chevy lineup continued to include the Bel Air for 1976 and beyond in two door, four door and station wagon body styles. The U.S. 1976 Impala line included an "S" model line, consisting of a 4-door sedan, to function as the Bel Air's replacement.

In Canada, Chevrolet retained the Bel Air as its lowest-priced full-size car through the 1981 model year. For 1977, Canadian Bel Airs received the same downsizing as their Impala/Caprice counterparts in the U.S. Body styles offered during this period were a four-door sedan, two-door coupe and station wagon. Reflecting the smaller size of these downsized big cars was a lineup of generally smaller engines for improved fuel economy with Chevy's 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder reinstated as standard power in sedans for the first time since 1973, with the {{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}} 305 V8 available as an option in sedans and standard on wagons. The {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} 350 V8, available in both models, was now the top option as the larger 400 small block and 454 big block V8s were no longer available. Standard equipment on Bel Airs during this period included small hubcaps, cloth-and-vinyl upholstery in sedans or all-vinyl in wagons, cigarette lighter, ashtray, automatic dome light for front doors, full carpeting, Astro Ventilation, Delco Freedom battery, variable-ratio power steering, power front disc brakes and Turbo Hydramatic [[automatic transmission]]. Unlike most previous model years and body styles where only two taillights were used per side, the Bel Air shared the Impala's rear end triple-taillight setup.

The 1980 Bel Air along with other full-size Chevrolets, was revised with all-new exterior sheet metal, which helped improve aerodynamics and thus fuel economy; the car was also fitted with a new grille, identical to that of the higher-priced Impala; the rear-end triple-taillight setup also continued to be shared with the Impala. Also that year, the engine lineup was revised with the [[Straight-6|inline six]] replaced by a new 3.8-liter or 229 cubic-inch [[V6]] based on the small-block [[V8 engine|V8]] as the base engine in sedans. The new base V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans) was a smaller 267 cubic-inch small-block with two-barrel carburetor, while the 305 small-block (optional on all models) got a {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} increase to {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}} thanks to the change from a two-barrel to four-barrel carburetor. The 350 V8 was now restricted to police-option vehicles. Another new option for 1980-81 was the Oldsmobile-built 350 Diesel.

With a dramatic downturn in full-size car sales, the Bel Air was dropped after the 1981 model year, as were a number of other low-trim full size cars in the Canadian market including the [[Pontiac Laurentian]], [[Mercury Marquis]] Meteor, and the [[Ford]] LTD Custom 500.

In 2002, a [[concept car|concept]] Bel Air convertible was shown at the [[North American International Auto Show]]. It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered [[tri-five]] (1955–57) models, such as the chrome windshield frame, traffic light viewfinder, and a gas filler cap behind the tail light, similar to 1956–1957 Chevy's gas cap behind the chrome trim on the back of the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948–1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light. It also features the same body on frame hydroforming technology (used in the frame rails of the Corvette and GM's midsize sport-utility vehicles) and a sheet metal body, on a {{convert|111|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase, and a {{convert|65|in|mm|abbr=on}} track. Suspension is short long arm up front and [[Hotchkiss drive]] in the rear. It rides on five-spoke aluminum wheels with {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}} red line tires and [[Anti-lock braking system|anti lock discs]] all-round. The elegant, yet simple interior features a twin-element instrument panel, column-mounted gearshift and bench seats covered in soft high-tech fabrics colored red to match the exterior that are cleverly designed to slide forward for easier backseat entry. It also served as a showcase for their new turbocharged inline five-cylinder concept engine based on the [[GM Atlas engine#L52|L52 (Vortec 3500)]], straight-5 truck engine. According to a September 2002 GM press release, the all-aluminum 3.5&amp;nbsp;L (211 cu in) 20-valve [[DOHC]] engine, with a bore of {{convert|93.0|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and a stroke of {{convert|102.0|mm|in|abbr=on}}, that delivers up to {{convert|315|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|315|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque, mated to a [[Hydra-Matic]] 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic. A virtual "turbo boost" button on the steering wheel activates the powertrain control module to trigger a more aggressive spark and fueling calibration for maximum horsepower. It also led the 13th Annual [[Stater Bros.#Route 66 Rendezvous|Stater Brothers Route 66 Rendezvous]] as the official vehicle in September 2002. General Motors has shown no interest in producing the car.&lt;ref&gt;2002 GM press release&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drag racing==
Of noteworthy importance is the 1962 Bel Air Sport Coupe, the last year a Bel Air pillarless hardtop was available in the US. This model featured the "bubbletop" roof from 1961 rather than the 1962 Impala Sport Coupe's more upright roof, and was popular with drag racers who ordered the car with the new-for-'61 409 cubic inch "W-block" [[V8 engine|V8]] with up to {{convert|409|bhp|abbr=on}}; a special package including aluminum body panels, heater delete, and four-speed manual transmission. A car with this configuration is a valuable collector vehicle that commands a big premium over other 1962 models including the Super Sport.
{{clear}}

==Australian Bel Airs==
During the 1960s, Bel Air sedans were available in export markets such as Australia, where they featured right-hand drive.  Due to Australian regulations requiring amber rear turn signal lamps, these Bel Air sedans featured Impala-style triple taillights during the 1960s.  The center lamp was the amber turn signal lamp and the innermost lights were backup lamps.  Most of these RHD Bel Airs used a 1961 Pontiac instrument panel.

The '''Chevrolet One-Fifty''' (or '''150''') was the economy/fleet model of the [[Chevrolet]] car from 1953 to 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-bel-air5.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1953 Chevrolet 150 Special and 210 Deluxe" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It took its name by shortening the production series number (1500) by one digit in order to capitalize on the numerical auto name trend of the 1950s.  The numerical designation "150" was also sporadically used in company literature. It replaced the Styleline Special model available in previous years. This model was dropped following the 1957 model year and replaced by the [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]].

[[File:1957-chevy-150-air-chevrolet-archives.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1957 Chevrolet 150 2-Door Sedan]]

== History ==
The One-Fifty was mainly conceived as a fleet model and little effort was spent marketing it to the average car buyer of the day, although sales weren't limited to fleets. It was most popular with police, state governments, small businesses, economy-minded consumers and hot rodders. Chevrolet sold substantially fewer One-Fifties than Two-Tens or the [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] in every year of its life.

True to Chevrolet's vision, the 150 was no-frills basic transportation. It had limited options, stark trim, solid colors, plain heavy duty upholstery and rubberized flooring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. "Kelly"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small things like ashtrays, cigarette lighters and even mirrors were extra cost options. Compared to the mid-level Two-Ten or premium Bel Air models, the One-Fifty was stark and bland. 
[[File:Chevrolet Sedan Delivery dutch licence registration BE-41-11 pic1.JPG|250px|left|thumb|The Chevrolet Sedan Delivery, was part of the One-Fifty line, and was also designated the 1508 in the truck line.]]
Body style choices were also limited to sedans, Handyman wagons (four-door in 1953–1954, two-door in 1955–1957) and (until 1955) the club coupe. The only body styles specific to the One-Fifty were decidedly fleet oriented&amp;nbsp;— the sedan delivery (a 2-door wagon without rear windows and the rear seat removed) and the business sedan&amp;nbsp;— a 2-door sedan with immobile rear windows and back seat removed. Powertrain choices were limited to manual transmissions and low output engines until 1954. In 1957, a full race-ready version was also available, commonly known as the "Black Widow" for its black-and-white paint color. It was equipped with 4-wheel heavy-duty brakes, 6-lug wheels and dual shock absorbers.

== Collector value ==
In general, One-Fifties are less valuable than the sibling Two-Ten and Bel Air models on the collectors' market, but the rare surviving sedan delivery or Utility Sedan can command premium prices, particularly the 1957 model when equipped with a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] engine.  [[V8 engine|V8]] One-Fifties are popular with hot rod enthusiasts, due to lower curb weight and lower prices. As many One-Fifty models saw use in law enforcement, this model often serves as the basis for latter-day modification into a 1950s-era police car.

== 1953–1954 models ==
[[File:Sam Rayburn House Museum June 2017 22 (Sam Rayburn's 1953 Chevrolet 150).jpg|thumb|A 1953 Chevrolet 150]]

This was the first year for both the One-Fifty and Two-Ten. The two model years were essentially the same, except that the business coupe was renamed the Utility Sedan for 1954.  The 150 came only with the base engine in 1953.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; The 150 came with a horn button, rather than the 210 and upscale Bel Air's horn ring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet/1953_Chevrolet_Brochure/1953%20Chevrolet-19.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Powertrains ===
Three engines were used in the 1953–1954 model years, although not all were available at the same time. All One-Fifties in 1953 used a 3-speed [[Synchromesh]] manual transmission.  Starting in 1954, Powerglide automatic transmission was available on this series.

*235.5 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; "Blue Flame" I6 7.5:1 CR {{convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (1954 optional equipment)

== 1955 ==
The 1955 model year marked the introduction of a new chassis, all new streamlined single bow bodywork, and the debut of Chevrolet's [[Small Block]] V8. The One-Fifty buyer was free to choose any powertrain option available. The business sedan was renamed the utility sedan this year. Unlike the 210 and the Bel Air, the 150 did not have any of the stainless steel trim.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;

=== Transmissions ===
*3-speed Synchromesh manual
*3-speed Synchromesh manual with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] unit
*2-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic.

== 1956 ==
Engine choices remained the same, except for higher power ratings.  The 265 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V8 was available in three different versions. The I6 had a new unified build regardless of transmission type.

The 1957 150 had side trim similar to the 1955's Bel Air trim. 56,266 '57 Chevy 150 four-door sedans were made, compared to the approximately 75,000 2-door versions.

The '''Chevrolet Townsman''' was a full-size [[station wagon]] produced by [[Chevrolet]] from 1953 to 1957 and again from 1969 to 1972.

== 1953–1957 ==
[[File:1957 Chevrolet Bel Air Townsman.jpg|thumb|right|1957 Chevrolet Bel Air Townsman station wagon]]
The Townsman name was first used in 1953 on the [[Chevrolet 210|210 series]] four-door station wagon, and used the [[GM A platform]]. For 1954, the name was shifted to the luxury [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] series station wagon, which featured [[DI-NOC]] woodgrain paneling. In both years, all Townsmans were eight-passenger models. In 1955 and 1956, the Townsman was once again a 210, but in 1957 it was available as both a 210 and a Bel Air. All 1955–1957 Townsmans were six-passenger models. A 235.5-cid inline six-cylinder engine was standard power in all five years, with V8s available beginning in 1955.

== 1969–1972 ==
[[File:1970 Chevrolet Townsman.jpg|thumb|right|1970 Chevrolet Townsman station wagon with 454-cid V8]]

During the second run, the Townsman was based on the rear-wheel drive [[GM B platform]]. It came in both six- and nine-passenger versions and only [[V8 engine|V8s]] were available, ranging from 327 to 427 cubic inches in 1969, and 350 to 454 cubic inches from 1970 forward. The sedan equivalent in this period was the [[Chevrolet Bel Air#1966–1975: Low-line model|Bel Air]]. It was considered a little more deluxe than the [[Chevrolet Brookwood]], but not quite as nice as the [[Chevrolet Kingswood]] and [[Chevrolet Kingswood Estate|Kingswood Estate]], which were Impala- and Caprice-level cars, respectively.

The 1971–72 wagons featured a [[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|'clamshell' design]] marketed as the ''Glide-away'' tailgate, also called a "disappearing" tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor.  The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate.  Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate.&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The '71 Wagons, Big Changes Coming Up |journal=Popular Science |date=October 1970 |pages=74–75 |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |first2=Jim |last2=Dunne |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22glide+away%22+tailgate#v=onepage&amp;q=%22glide%20away%22%20tailgate&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years.  Wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat—and could accommodate a 4′ × 8′ sheet of plywood with rear seats folded.  The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door—for example, in a closed garage. That year wheelbase also increased from 119″ to 125″, the longest of any Chevrolet regular passenger car ever produced. Most options, aside from power windows and six-way front seat (with driver's control), were available on Townsman (and its less-expensive Brookwood counterpart) wagon models.

Midway through the 1971 model year, Turbo HydraMatic transmission was made standard equipment on all full-sized station wagons, including Townsmans; this eliminated the need for customers to have to specifically specify an automatic transmission that virtually every wagon that had been built since the late 1960s was getting anyway.

For 1973, Chevrolet eliminated the Townsman and upper-level Kingswood/Kingswood Estate designations for its full-sized station wagons. The Bel Air nameplate continued to be applied to all full-sized wagons through 1975 in the United States, and 1981 in Canada. In both countries, the same model-year changes were applied to Bel Air wagons as its more-expensive Impala and Caprice brethren.

The '''Chevrolet Kingswood''' was a 4-door [[station wagon]] produced by [[Chevrolet]] in 1959 and 1960, and again from 1969 to 1972 built on the [[GM B platform|GM B Body]] platform.

For the second time in as many years, Chevrolet again came up with a totally new car. From the front or rear the 1959 Chevrolets resembled nothing else on the road. From the headlights, placed as low as the law would allow, to the cats-eye tail lights, the 1959 Chevrolet was a brand new car with all new sheet metal. The most visual new change was the flat, wing shaped tailfins. The car was built on a {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[wheelbase]] and was {{convert|211|in|mm|abbr=on}} long, which was {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} longer than the 1957 model. This made Chevrolet the longest car in the low-priced range, whereas two years before it had been the shortest. In addition, the car was {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} wider outside and had {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} more width inside than it did in 1958, through the reduction of door thickness. The frame GM X frame had no side rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure/1959%20Chevrolet-22.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Kingswood was offered as a mid range full size 4-door only 9 passenger model, with rear-facing 3rd row jump-seat standard. It was positioned between the Parkwood 6-passenger and the Nomad (now Impala based), still at the top was a six-passenger car.
Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers matching the car series. Chevrolet eliminated its entry-level [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]] based Yeoman models and the Biscayne-based Brookwood became Chevrolet's least expensive wagon models. Brookwoods were now available in two-door or four-door body styles, both in six-passenger configuration only. The new Parkwood 6-passenger and new Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air's model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. The Nomad was still the top Chevy wagon. A parking brake warning light was optional. Under the hood, little change took place for '59 Chevys.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1959%20Chevrolet%20Manual-04.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Few alterations were made for 1960. The new models were refinements of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, the return of the double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling "cat's eyes" of 1959. Under the hood, things remained constant. Fuel injection was no longer available, but with the 348 cubic inch engine, a horsepower rating of 335 at 5800&amp;nbsp;rpm was now achieved. This involved the use of three double-barrel carburetors, a special cam and an 11.25:1 compression ratio, all sold as a package.

===Safety===

Chevrolet's 1959 and '60 Kingswoods (as well as the rest of Chevy's full size line up) still featured Chevrolet's "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame introduced in '58. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these "X-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons/1958%20Chevrolet%20Wagons-06-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1958-chevrolet.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discontinuation and replacement===

General Motors discontinued the Chevrolet Kingswood wagon nameplate after only two years. For 1961 they offered a third row nine-passenger option on Brookwood to fill the void. The wagon only nameplates Brookwood, Parkwood, and Nomad were gone for 1962, instead naming their station wagons after their series names: [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]] (replacing Brookwood directly), [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]]. The 1962-'64 Biscayne, Bel Air, and Impala wagons were very similar to Chevy's 1961 wagon models.

The Kingswood name returned for the 1969 model year, based on the [[Chevrolet Impala#1958.E2.80.931972|Impala]], and was available only with a [[V8 engine|V8]]. It slotted above the [[Chevrolet Townsman]]; a [[Chevrolet Caprice|Caprice]]-based '''Kingswood Estate''' model was added at the top of the range with exterior woodgrain paneling. Throughout this period, the Kingswood was available in both two- and three-seat models; a power rear window was initially standard equipment for the latter and optional for the former. For 1971, the power rear window became standard for both models.

Midway through the 1971 model year, the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission became standard, and the three-speed manual transmission was eliminated. A Turbo-Hydramatic had been ordered on nearly all Kingswoods built during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

For 1973, Chevrolet eliminated the Kingswood Estate/Kingswood, along with their Townsman and Brookwood sister nameplates, for its full-sized station wagons; they now utilized the Bel Air, Impala, and Caprice nameplates from their sedan counterparts.

The '''Chevrolet Monte Carlo''' is a two-door [[coupe]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Chevrolet]] from 1970 to 2007 [[model year]]s (non-continuously), encompassing six generations. Chevrolet positioned the Monte Carlo as a [[personal luxury car]], with the last generation classified as a full-sized [[coupé]]. 

The first four generations of the Monte Carlo (1970–1972, 1973–1977, 1978–1980, and 1981–1988) were of a rear-wheel-drive, V8-powered (a V6 engine from 1978) coupe design, using [[body-on-frame]] construction. The later rear-wheel-drive generations did not incorporate the trend of uni-body construction that became more prevalent in the early 1980s as automakers downsized their vehicle lines to satisfy increasing demand for [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel-economy]] after the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[early 1980s recession]].

After the discontinuation of the rear-drive Monte Carlo after 1988, the nameplate was revived in 1994 for the fifth-generation, a front-drive, V6-powered coupe based on the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] sedan. The sixth and final-generation Monte Carlo from 1999 was built alongside the [[Chevrolet Impala]], which succeeded the Lumina as Chevrolet's mid-sized sedan. The Monte Carlo SS was revived from 1999 to 2007, that was initially powered by 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 (supercharged in 2004 and 2005) and by a 5.3&amp;nbsp;L V8 for 2006 and 2007.

The car was named for the city [[Monte Carlo]] in the Principality of [[Monaco]], specifically the [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] of Monte Carlo/Spélugues.

===Development===
For the 1968 model year, GM instituted a split-[[wheelbase]] policy for its [[GM A platform|A-platform]] intermediate-sized cars. Two-door models would have a {{convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} for [[sedan (car)|sedans]], and {{convert|121|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} for [[station wagon]]s. In 1969, GM introduced the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], a two-door that used A-platform layout that was stretched ahead of the [[Firewall (automobile)|firewall]] to make it {{convert|210.2|in|mm|0|adj=on}} long. This gave the design an unusually long hood design helping the new Grand Prix to outsell its larger [[GM B platform|B-body]] predecessor, despite higher prices. The new layout was first known as the A-body Special, but would evolve into its own class known as the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-platform]].

The Monte Carlo started as Chevrolet's version of Pontiac Grand Prix, as conceived by [[Pete Estes|Elliot M. (Pete) Estes]], general manager of Chevrolet, and Chevrolet's chief [[Automotive stylist|stylist]], David Holls. They modeled the styling on the contemporary [[Cadillac Eldorado]], although much of the body and structure were shared with the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] (firewall, windshield, decklid, and rear window were the same). New exterior "[[coke bottle styling]]" featured concealed windshield wipers. A light monitoring system was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1970_Chevrolet/1970_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1970%20Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo-09.html |title=1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-1990s article in the magazine ''Chevrolet High Performance'' stated that the first generation Monte Carlo was known to Chevrolet management under the working name ''Concours''. Usual practice at the time was that all Chevrolet model development names started with a "C". At one point, the proposal called for a formal coupe, sedan, and convertible. It has been noted that the sedan resembled a full-size [[Oldsmobile 98]] prior to the use of the GM G platform with at least one photo showing the pull-up door handles that would be introduced on the 1970½ Camaro and 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]] and full-sized Chevys, but not appear on Monte Carlos until the second-generation model debuted in 1973. When the car debuted for the 1970 model year, the only body style available was the two-door hardtop.

Though the Monte Carlo was developed at Chevrolet under the leadership of Pete Estes, it was formally introduced in September 1969 by [[John Z. DeLorean]], who succeeded Estes as Chevrolet's general manager earlier in the year after previously heading the Pontiac division, where he led the development of the Grand Prix.

===1970===
The styling of the 1970 model-year Monte Carlo is distinguished by its chromed rectangular grille having a fine grid pattern of 720 small squares with two horizontal dividers, and centered in it, a chrome and red crest emblem adorned by a [[Corinthian helmet]] (commonly referred to as the “knight’s crest”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewswheel.com/behind-badge-cryptic-origins-monte-carlo-red-knights-crest/ |title=Behind the Badge: Cryptic Origins of Monte Carlo's Red Knight's Crest &amp;#124; The News Wheel |publisher=TheNewsWheel.com |date= October 26, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a thin hood spear with no vertical hood ornament, round headlamps with rounded chrome bezels (which appeared on a prototype 1970 Chevelle front end proposal which was rejected for the 4 headlight design), circular parking lamps inset into the front bumper directly below the headlamps, and tail lights with chrome trim around the perimeter of the lens, only.

The standard powertrain was the {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|Chevrolet "Turbo-Fire" small-block V8]] with a two-barrel [[carburetor]], rated at 250&amp;nbsp;hp (186&amp;nbsp;kW) (gross) at 4500&amp;nbsp;rpm and 345&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (468&amp;nbsp;Nm) of torque at 2800&amp;nbsp;rpm, mated to a column-mounted 3-speed Synchro-Mesh manual transmission. Front [[disc brake]]s were standard equipment. The dashboard was basically identical to the Chevelle except for fake wood trim, according to Holls a photographic reproduction of the [[elm]] trim used by [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]], and higher grade nylon (or vinyl) upholstery and deep-twist carpeting were used. Base priced at US$3,123, the Monte Carlo cost $218 more than a comparable [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle Malibu]].

Various options were available. A two-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] (on 350&amp;nbsp;CID engines only), three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]], or a four-speed manual; most Monte Carlos were built with the Turbo-Hydramatic. Variable-ratio power steering, power windows, air conditioning, power seats, "rally" wheels, bucket seats, center console, full instrumentation, and other accessories were also available, bringing the price of a fully equipped Monte Carlo to more than $5,000.

Optional engines included the four-barrel carbureted Turbo-Fire 350&amp;nbsp;CID [[Chevrolet small-block V8|small block V8]], rated at 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW) at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm and 380&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (515&amp;nbsp;Nm) at 3200&amp;nbsp;rpm, the Turbo-Fire 400 (400&amp;nbsp;CID/6.5&amp;nbsp;L) with a two-barrel carburetor, rated at 265&amp;nbsp;hp (198&amp;nbsp;kW) at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm and 400&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (542&amp;nbsp;Nm) at 3800&amp;nbsp;rpm, and the Turbo-Jet 400 (402&amp;nbsp;CID/6.6&amp;nbsp;L) with a four-barrel carburetor, rated at 330&amp;nbsp;hp (246&amp;nbsp;kW) at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm and 410&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (515&amp;nbsp;Nm) at 3200&amp;nbsp;rpm). Note that the two Chevrolet 400&amp;nbsp;CID V8s offered this year were actually two different designs. The two-barrel carbureted Turbo-Fire 400 was a Small Block Chevrolet V8 engine, similar, but different internally, to the 350, while the Turbo-Jet 400 was a slightly enlarged version of the 396&amp;nbsp;CID big block [[V8 engine|V8]] and had an actual displacement of 402&amp;nbsp;CID.

The most ''sporty'' and powerful option was the Monte Carlo SS 454 package. Priced at $420, it included a standard [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|Turbo-Jet 454]] of 454&amp;nbsp;CID (7.4&amp;nbsp;L) with a four-barrel carburetor, rated at 360&amp;nbsp;hp (269&amp;nbsp;kW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1970_Chevrolet/1970_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1970%20Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo-11.html |title=1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 4800&amp;nbsp;rpm. It also included heavy-duty [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], wider tires, "SS 454" badging, and an automatic load-leveling rear suspension. The Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic was the only transmission available for this package. The rear axle came standard with a 3.06 ratio but was available in 2.56 and 3.31, although it still cost $222 (£142) extra. Weighing only a bit more than a comparably equipped Chevelle SS 454, the Monte Carlo SS was quite a fast car, although it accounted for less than 3% of Monte Carlos sold in 1970.

A [[labor strike]] at Chevrolet's Flint, Michigan assembly plant (where most Monte Carlo production was scheduled) during the early months of the 1970 model year immediately following the car's introduction on September 18, 1969 limited overall model-year sales to 159,341; short of the projected 185,000. During those early months, Monte Carlos were in short supply, with full-scale production not happening until February 1970, leaving many would-be buyers disappointed after going to their Chevrolet dealers and finding no Monte Carlos in stock. Once full production was underway, Monte Carlos sold well and often at full list price (usually being ordered with many extra-cost options), making it a profitable model for Chevrolet and its dealership networks. SS 454s, however, did not sell so well in 1970, with only 3,823 of the 1970 Monte Carlos being the most powerful model in the range.

Popular Mechanics reported 82% of readers who bought a Monte Carlo got one for the styling, however 10.1% of readers disliked the amount of rear leg room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QtgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=Chevrolet+Monte+Carlo#v=onepage&amp;q=Chevrolet+Monte+Carlo&amp;f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|first=Hearst|last=Magazines|date=April 1, 1970|publisher=Hearst Magazines|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971===
The 1971 model saw minor styling changes, mostly cosmetic. The headlamp bezels were more of a [[squircle]] shape with rectangular front parking lamps. The grille had no horizontal divider and the openings were rectangular-shaped. The hood spear included a stand-up ornament with “Chevrolet” script lettering. The grill emblem featured the year, "1971" in Roman numerals. The trunk lock keyhole had the Monte Carlo crest surrounding it. The tail lights now had two horizontal and one vertical chrome strips. Inside, the SS model got new "European symbol knobs", and a four-spoke [[steering wheel]] became optional. AM/FM stereo radios with [[8-track tape|8-track]] tape players were also optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1971_Chevrolet/1971_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1971%20Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo-12.html |title=1971 Chevrolet Monte Carlo brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically it was largely unchanged, although the small-block Turbo-Fire 400 two-barrel engine was dropped. Other engines had [[compression ratio]]s lowered to allow the use of regular [[tetraethyllead|leaded]], low-lead, or [[unleaded gasoline]], per a GM corporate edict. Engine ratings fell to 245&amp;nbsp;hp (183&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]]) for the base Turbo-Fire 350&amp;nbsp;CID (5.7&amp;nbsp;L) two-barrel, 270&amp;nbsp;hp (201&amp;nbsp;kW) for the Turbo-Fire 350-4V, and 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW) for the Turbo-Jet 400. The SS 454 engine was actually raised to a nominal 365 gross&amp;nbsp;hp (272&amp;nbsp;kW) despite the reduction in compression ratio. This increase in horsepower was a result of the 454 engine using the more aggressive camshaft from the 390&amp;nbsp;hp 454 used in the 1970 Chevrolet Corvette and full-sized sedans.

Chevrolet listed both gross and SAE net horsepower figures in 1971 with the impending change to SAE net ratings in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---Oct/1971-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Brochure-Cdn/1971-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Cdn--06-07&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings compared as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

|Turbo-Fire 350&amp;nbsp;CID V8 || 2-bbl|| 245&amp;nbsp;hp || 165&amp;nbsp;hp

|-
|Turbo-Jet 454&amp;nbsp;CID V8 || 4-bbl|| 365&amp;nbsp;hp || 285&amp;nbsp;hp
|}

The SS 454 package would be discontinued after this year following production of only 1,919 units, but the 454&amp;nbsp;CID V8 engine would remain optional in Monte Carlos through 1975. The reason given for discontinuing the SS was that the Monte Carlo was marketed as a luxury vehicle instead of a muscle car. The SS nameplate would be resurrected 12 years later. Yet, at the same time that the Monte Carlo SS was judged a failure in the marketplace and discontinued, the Monte's reputation as a performance car on the race track was gaining strength because [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] were ending their factory-backed racing support due to declining muscle car sales and the need to divert dollars to meet costly Federal safety and emission regulations (General Motors' official policy had prohibited factory racing efforts since 1963). As factory support ended at Ford and Chrysler, the stock-car racing mantle switched to independent teams and sponsors, who overwhelmingly chose Chevrolets over Ford and Chrysler products due to Chevy's much greater availability and affordability of over-the-counter racing parts through the Chevy dealer network. The Monte Carlo was considered the best suited Chevrolet model for stock car racing by most NASCAR teams due to its {{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase (only one inch above NASCAR's minimum requirements at that time, the Chevelle 2-doors had a shorter 112-inch wheelbase) and long-hood design which placed the engine further back in the chassis than most other vehicles for better weight distribution. Thus the Monte Carlo became Chevy's standard-bearer for NASCAR from 1971 to 1989.

Production of the 1971 Monte Carlo got off to a slow start due to a 67-day corporate-wide walkout (labor strike) that coincided with the introduction of the 1971 models in September 1970.  This left dealerships with only a small shipment of 1971 models (built before the strike) in stock until the strike was settled in mid-November 1970, and then slow-going in reaching normal production levels until around January 1, 1971. Model-year production ended at 128,600 including the 1,919 SS models.

A total of 12 1971 Monte Carlo's were shipped to Australia in 1971 and converted to RH drive, 4 of these were SS models from the 1,919 produced.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===1972===
A [[Cadillac]]-like egg-crate grille similar to the 1971 [[Chevrolet Caprice]], rectangular front parking lamps moved to the left and right edges of the grille, a wider hood spear without stand-up ornament, and a metal rear trim molding highlighted the changes to the 1972 Monte Carlo, the final year for the first generation design. The SS was dropped, but a new Monte Carlo Custom option appeared as a one-year only offering that included a special suspension and other items previously included with the SS option. Unlike the departed SS package, it was available with any engine on the roster. The Monte Carlo Custom badging was similar to the Impala Custom.

The engines were largely unchanged, but an industry-wide switch to SAE net&amp;nbsp;hp numbers led to a reduction in the rated power of all Chevrolet engines. Chevrolet did not list gross horsepower figures for 1972. Compared to 1971 figures, only the 402 and 454 had a decrease in power. The new ratings for the Monte Carlo were:
* 350&amp;nbsp;CID (5.7L), two-barrel: 165&amp;nbsp;hp
* 350&amp;nbsp;CID (5.7L), four-barrel: 175&amp;nbsp;hp
* 402&amp;nbsp;CID (6.6L), four-barrel: 240&amp;nbsp;hp
* 454&amp;nbsp;CID (7.4L), four-barrel: 270&amp;nbsp;hp

In [[California]], which had emissions standards more stringent than federal law, the 4-barrel carbureted 350 was the standard and only available engine. Also, the only transmission offered in California was the Turbo Hydramatic.
[[File:Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|right|1972 Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]
For 1972, the four-speed manual transmission was discontinued from the option list as a line in the Monte Carlo brochure describing its market position as a personal luxury car stated "Sorry, no four-on-the-floor." The standard three-speed manual and optional two-speed Powerglide automatic transmissions were offered only with the base 350&amp;nbsp;CID two-barrel engine, with the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic also available with this engine and a mandatory option with each of the optional engines.

Mechanically, the most significant change was that variable-ratio power steering became standard equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---August/1972-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Brochure-Cdn/1972-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Cdn--06-07 |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916012441/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---August/1972-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Brochure-Cdn/1972-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Cdn--06-07 |archive-date=September 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time.

Interior trim was relatively unchanged from 1971 other than the availability of all-vinyl upholstery with the standard bench seat in addition to the optional Strato bucket seats. Cloth interiors were also offered with both bench and bucket seats. The 1972 model year's production increased to 180,819 to set a new record in the final year for the first-generation A-body. Monte Carlo and other Chevrolet models were promoted as part of a new ad campaign in which Chevys in print and broadcast ads were featured at various tourist attractions and sites around the United States under the tagline "Chevrolet: Building a Better Way To See The USA."{{clear right}}

===1973===
A redesigned Monte Carlo was introduced alongside other GM intermediates. Like other GM mid-size cars, the 1973 Monte Carlo was no longer a [[hardtop]], but a pillared coupe with rear side opera windows and frameless door glass. Prominent styling features included an egg-crate grille with a Monte Carlo emblem in front and vertical taillights above the bumper. The front bumper was a large federally mandated {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper that was among the required 1973 federal safety standards for all passenger cars sold in the U.S. with the {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} requirement extended to rear bumpers on 1974 models. Also new was a double-shell roof for improved noise reduction and rollover protection along with the flush-mounted pull-up exterior door handles first introduced on the 1970½ Camaro and 1971 full-sized Chevrolets and Vegas.

The separate [[body-on-frame]] construction carried over for 1973, as was the basic all-coil suspension. For improved ride and handling, the 1973 Monte Carlo featured a number of innovations (for a large American car) such as standard [[radial-ply tire]]s, Pliacell shock absorbers, high-caster steering, and front and rear [[anti-roll bar]]s (previously offered only with the SS package). The standard Monte Carlo with manual transmission, retained "traditional" steering and [[bias-ply tire]]s, but the radial-tuned system was included when the automatic transmission was ordered, earning the '''Monte Carlo S''' label.

A new model for 1973 was the '''Monte Carlo Landau''', which was basically an "S" with a rear quarter Landau vinyl roof, Turbine II wheels and driver and passenger-side sport mirrors. The interior of the 1973 Monte Carlo featured an all-new, wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel, similar to that found in some contemporary [[Pontiac]]s, [[Oldsmobile]]s and [[Buick]]s, in which gauges and various instruments were centered within easy reach of the driver. The simulated burl elm trim was retained. A split bench seat was standard, but "Strato Bucket" seats of a new design were optional, along with a floor console featuring an equally new shifter with knob and button similar to Pontiac's Rally Sports Shifter replacing the Buick-like horseshoe shifter of previous years, and storage compartment. The [[bucket seat]]s were of a one-piece high-back design with built-in headrests, and could [[Swivel seat|swivel]] some 90 degrees to permit the driver and front passenger easier entry and exit. Cloth and vinyl trims were offered with both the bench and bucket seats.

The standard engine was a 145 (net)&amp;nbsp;hp (108&amp;nbsp;kW) 350&amp;nbsp;CID (5.7&amp;nbsp;L) Turbo-Fire V8. Optional engines included a 175 (net)&amp;nbsp;hp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) 350&amp;nbsp;CID V8 with a four-barrel carburetor and a four-barrel carbureted 454&amp;nbsp;CID Turbo-Jet V8 rated at 245 (net)&amp;nbsp;hp (183&amp;nbsp;kW).

The 1973 Monte Carlo was named ''[[Motor Trend]]'''s "Car of the Year", due to its new styling and emphasis on Euro-style ride and handling. The 1973 Monte Carlo set a new sales record for Chevrolet, with nearly 250,000 sold for the model year. The success of the Monte Carlo and Pontiac's similar Grand Prix led to several new personal luxury cars from competitors, including subsequent [[Mercury Cougar]], the [[Ford Elite|Ford Gran Torino Elite]], the [[Chrysler Cordoba]] and restyled [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]], and even high-line versions of the [[AMC Matador]], which got a new coupe design for 1974.

===1974===
[[File:Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Les chauds vendredis '10).JPG|thumb|right|1974 Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]
The 1974 Monte Carlo received minor detail changes from its 1973 predecessor, most notably a revised egg-crate&lt;ref name="autogenerated1946" /&gt; grille in the front, flush mount taillights (no longer recessed with horizontal chrome bars), a shorter trunk deck that housed the relocated license plate and the trunk lock mechanism. In 1973 the trunk lock was below the trunk deck and above the rear bumper in a space that no longer existed on the 1974. A larger {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} rear bumper was added, and in the interior the driver and passenger door map pockets were no longer available.

The base Monte Carlo with manual transmission, standard suspension and bias-ply tires was discontinued, leaving only the "S" and "Landau" models equipped with radial-ply tires and upgraded suspensions along with standard power steering and front disc brakes.

A three-speed manual transmission was listed as standard equipment on 1974 "S" and "Landau" models equipped with the standard 350&amp;nbsp;CID V8, and an automatic transmission was a required option with the larger 400 and 454&amp;nbsp;CID V8s. However, a number of sources indicate that Chevrolet built virtually all 1974 Monte Carlos with the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.

The standard 350&amp;nbsp;CID Turbo-Fire V8 was again rated at {{convert|145|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with two-barrel carburetor in 49 states. For Californians, the standard engine was a 350 Turbo-Fire V8 with a four-barrel carburetor rated at {{convert|160|hp|kW|abbr=on}} that was not offered in the other 49 states. Reappearing on the Monte's option list for the first time since 1970 was a 400&amp;nbsp;CID Turbo-Fire small block V8 rated at {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on}} with a two-barrel carburetor (not offered in California) or 180&amp;nbsp;hp (134&amp;nbsp;kW) with a four-barrel carburetor. The top engine was again the 454&amp;nbsp;CID Turbo-Jet big block V8 rated at 235&amp;nbsp;hp (183&amp;nbsp;kW).

Despite the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of late 1973 and early 1974 that greatly cut into sales of standard and intermediate-sized cars in favor of smaller compacts and imported subcompacts, the Monte Carlo went the other way on the sales charts by setting a new sales record this year of over 300,000 units despite the long lines at gas stations and record-high gasoline prices. The Monte Carlo continued to lead in intermediate personal luxury car sales with the Grand Prix placing second and the arrival of new competitors this year, including an upsized [[Mercury Cougar]], [[Ford Torino#1974|Ford Gran Torino Elite]] and AMC's [[AMC Matador|Matador]] coupe. [[Chrysler]] would introduce its entries in this field for 1975 including the [[Chrysler Cordoba]] and redesigned [[Dodge Charger]].

===1975===
[[File:'75 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Orange Julep).JPG|thumb|right|1975 Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]

The 1975 Monte Carlo received only minor styling changes from the 1974 model, including a new grille with the Monte Carlo emblem moved to the center section and new vertically shaped taillights with horizontal louvers. All models received catalytic converters to meet the latest federal and California emission requirements that included bonuses such as improved fuel economy and drivability, along with longer spark plug and muffler life, but required more expensive and lower-octane unleaded gasoline.

Engines were carryover from 1974 except for the addition of GM's High Energy electronic ignition being made standard equipment. However, power ratings for all engines were decreased due to the addition of the catalytic converter. The 454&amp;nbsp;CID V8 no longer offered on California cars, leaving the 400&amp;nbsp;CID four-barrel the top engine in the Golden State. The base 350&amp;nbsp;CID two-barrel was rated at {{convert|145|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (standard in 49 states), the 350&amp;nbsp;CID 4-barrel was rated at {{convert|155|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (available only in California), the 400&amp;nbsp;CID 4-barrel {{convert|175|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, and the 454&amp;nbsp;CID 4-barrel {{convert|215|hp|kW|abbr=on}} (now equipped with single exhaust with dual exhaust as an option). A three-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard equipment with the base 350&amp;nbsp;CID [[V8 engine|V8]] used in 49 states and California-only 350 four-barrel V8. The Turbo Hydra-Matic optional and a required option for the 400 and 454 V8s. Chevrolet sources, however, report that virtually all 1975 Monte Carlos were equipped with the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, which became standard equipment for 1976.

New for 1975 was a Custom interior option that included a plusher cloth 50/50 bench seat with recliner on passenger side and lower door panel carpeting. The standard interior still consisted of a bench seat with knit-cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery. The swiveling Strato bucket seats plus console and floor shifter were still optional with knit cloth or vinyl upholstery. Also, white all-vinyl interiors were available for the first time this year with either bench or bucket seats with contrasting colors for carpeting and instrument panels including black, red, blue and green. A gauge that showed if one was using too much gas, a part of the "Economider" Gauge package, became optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1975_Chevrolet/1975_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1975%20Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo-11.html |title=1975 Chevrolet Monte Carlo brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales dropped off a bit from 1974's record-setting pace due to higher prices resulting from the addition of the catalytic converter, double-digit inflation and new competition from Chrysler's Cordoba and Dodge's Charger SE. Monte Carlo production ended up at around 250,000 units but would rebound to set a new record in 1976.

===1976===
A new crosshatch grille and vertically mounted rectangular headlamps, along with reshaped taillights identified the 1976 Monte Carlo (the reshaped taillight pattern was later incorporated into the fourth generation Monte Carlo). Under the hood, a new {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 305&amp;nbsp;CID 2-barrel V8 became the standard engine with the {{convert|145|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 350 2-barrel V8 and {{convert|175|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 400&amp;nbsp;CID V8 both optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1976_Chevrolet/1976_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1976%20Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo-06.html |title=1976 Chevrolet Monte Carlo brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; California cars got a {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 350 4-barrel as the base engine (not available in 49 states), and could be equipped with the 400 4-barrel [[V8 engine|V8]]. The big-block 454&amp;nbsp;CID V8 was discontinued from the option list this year. The Turbo Hydramatic transmission became standard equipment on all 1976 Monte Carlos.

Interior trims remained the same as 1975 with both base and Custom levels, but the instrument panel and steering wheel featured a new rosewood trim replacing the burled elm of previous years. A new option was a two-toned "Fashion Tone" paint combination. Monte Carlo sales hit an all-time record with production of 353,272 units this year.
191,370 "S" Coupes were made.
161,902 Landau Coupes which were $293 more.

===1977===
[[File:'76 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg|thumb|right|1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]
A revised grille with smaller segments with the Monte Carlo "knight's crest" emblem moved to a stand-up hood ornament&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-monte-carlo8.htm |title=1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=July 31, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revised taillight lenses marked the 1977 Monte Carlo, which was the last year for the 1973-vintage design before the introduction of a downsized 1978 Monte Carlo. Engine offerings were reduced to two engines for 1977. The base engine for 49 states was the {{convert|140|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 305&amp;nbsp;CID 2-barrel V8 and the {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 350 4-barrel&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1977" /&gt; V8 was optional (standard in California). The 400-cubic-inch V8 was dropped as an engine option. The Turbo Hydra-matic transmission was included standard equipment.

Interior trim received only minor revisions this year with upholstery choices including cloth, velour and vinyl in both base and Custom trims. Swivel out seats and 8-track were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Chevrolet/1977_Chevrolet/1977_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1977-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-06 |title=1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo brochure |page=6 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=April 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710042749/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/Chevrolet/1977_Chevrolet/1977_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1977-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-06 |archive-date=July 10, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model year marks the only time in history when an intermediate model was larger in every dimension than a full-sized model, as the B-body [[Chevrolet Caprice]]/[[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] had already been redesigned and downsized for 1977. The Monte Carlo also weighed more.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1" /&gt; In 1977 sales totaled 224,327 S coupes and 186,711 Landau coupes.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1" /&gt;

All GM intermediate-sized cars including the Monte Carlo were downsized for the 1978 model year in response to the 1973 [[Arab Oil Embargo]] and [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy|CAFE]] requirements. The 1978 model was 700-800&amp;nbsp;lb lighter and some 15 inches shorter than the 1977 model. The 1978 model also had more interior and trunk space than the earlier 1977 model. The engines offered in previous years were dropped in favor of a standard 231&amp;nbsp;CID V6 built by Buick or an optional Chevrolet 305&amp;nbsp;CID [[V8 engine|V8]]. New one-piece wall-to-wall carpeting was standard.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com" /&gt; The three-speed manual transmission reappeared for the first time in several years as standard equipment on the base model with the [[V6 engine]], and the automatic was optional. The optional V8 and all Landau models came standard with the automatic. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] with floor shifter was optional with the 305 V8, the first time a four-speed manual was offered on the Monte Carlo since 1971.
[[File:Wiki79.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]

Only minor trim changes were made to the 1979 Monte Carlo which included a restyled grille, revised parking lamp detail and new wrap-around taillamps. Mechanical changes included a new Chevrolet-built [[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#3.3L (200 CID)|200&amp;nbsp;CID]] V6 as the standard engine for the base Monte Carlo in 49 states while the Buick 231&amp;nbsp;CID V6 remained standard on base models in California and all Landau models. A new {{convert|125|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 267 CID V8 became optional and the {{convert|140|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 305&amp;nbsp;CID V8 continued as an option but was joined by a 160&amp;nbsp;hp {{convert|235|lbfft|Nm|abbr=on}} version with a four-barrel carburetor. The same transmissions were carried over from 1978, including a standard three-speed manual and optional four-speed manual, or an optional three-speed Turbo Hydramatic [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. 1979 would be the last year that Chevrolet would offer manual transmissions on the Monte Carlo due to extremely low buyer interest. A black 1979 Monte Carlo was used by Michael Platt and William Matix during the [[1986 FBI Miami shootout]]. A 1979 Monte Carlo modified to a [[lowrider]], was also heavily featured in the 2001 movie ''[[Training Day]]''. The car was driven by the main character Detective Alonzo Harris, played by actor [[Denzel Washington]].

For 1980, the car received a mild frontal restyle, with quad headlights and turn indicators mounted beneath.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=1980 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Brochure|year=1980|publisher=GM|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1980_Chevrolet/1980_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1980%20Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo-02.html|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric 200 3-speed automatic transmission became standard on all models and a new Chevrolet-built [[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#3.8L (229 CID)|229&amp;nbsp;CID]] V6 with 2-barrel Rochester carburetor replaced both the 200&amp;nbsp;CID V6 of 1979 and the Buick engine offered on all 1978 models and the 1979 Landau as the standard engine in 49 states (California cars still got the Buick engine). A new option for 1980 was Buick's turbocharged version of the 231&amp;nbsp;CID V6 rated at {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Other optional engines included 267 and 305&amp;nbsp;CID versions of the Chevrolet small-block V8 with up to {{convert|155|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. Front head room was 37.6 inches, while rear head room was a little bigger, at 37.8 inches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; A power trunk opener was still optional.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; There were a total of 13,839 turbo Monte Carlo's for 1980. A new 14" rally wheel option was introduced with 5 slots (with squared ends and a pointed edge) – later shared with subsequent Chevrolet/GMC A/G-bodies including the Chevrolet S10 light duty truck.

===1981–1984===
The body was restyled with the other GM mid-size formal coupes ([[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]], [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Buick Regal]]). It featured a smoother profile than the previous models and new vertical taillights similar to the 1973–1977 models. Engine offerings were carried over, including the standard [[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#3.8L (229 CID)|229&amp;nbsp;CID]] Chevrolet V6 (231&amp;nbsp;CID Buick V6 in California) an optional 267&amp;nbsp;CID V8 (not available in California), a 305&amp;nbsp;CID V8 in the base and Landau models, and a turbocharged {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 231&amp;nbsp;CID Buick V6 in the Monte Carlo Turbo. There were a total of 3,027 Monte Carlo Turbos for 1981. The Monte Carlo Turbo appeared slightly different from other Monte Carlos that year because in addition to the turbo motor it also was equipped with a small hood scoop on the left side of the hood. It also had Turbo 3.8 badges with Chevrolet bowtie on the sides of the hood scoop, on the trunk lid, and on the right side of the dash. An automatic transmission, power steering and power front disc brakes were standard equipment. While this car was considered by some to be much better looking (and appeared more aerodynamic) than its Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix, and Olds Cutlass cousins, only one team tried to make a go of it in NASCAR cup racing. While the big Monte Carlo was the dominant body style in the late 1970s, winning 30 or so races, the downsized (and cleaned-up) 1981 body would only take two checkered flags in the 1981 and 1982 seasons when it was run. 
Few revisions were made on the 1982 Monte Carlo. All engines, except for the turbocharged 231&amp;nbsp;CID V6, which was discontinued along with the Monte Carlo Turbo model, were carried over from 1981. New for 1982 were the additions of a 260&amp;nbsp;CID V6 and an Oldsmobile 350&amp;nbsp;CID V8, both of which were diesel engines. With the introduction of GM's new mid-size platform that saw the introduction of the [[Buick Century]], [[Chevrolet Celebrity]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]] and [[Pontiac 6000]], the chassis designations were shuffled up. The new mid-size cars were designated as [[GM A platform (FWD)|A-body]] cars, whereas the cars previously designated as [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-bodies]] were now called [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-bodies]]. A black exterior was not offered in 1982 and also not available in 1982 for the first time in Monte Carlo history was a sportier interior option with Strato bucket seats and console, as only the standard notchback bench or optional 55/45 bench were offered this year. Weight distribution was 57% in the front and 43% in the rear.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1982" /&gt;
[[File:83-86 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS.jpg|thumb|left|1983–1988 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS]]
Receiving only minor updates, the 1983 model year Monte Carlo gained a revised grille and interior trim patterns. The standard engine continued to be the 229 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V6, and the 165&amp;nbsp;hp 305 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; V8 was optional. The Super Sport Package, Z65 was once again made an option in 1983. The Monte Carlo SS was reintroduced in 1983, following twelve years of being discontinued. The Monte Carlo SS featured European body color-coding, a new front fascia, a rear spoiler and a V8.
The 1984 year model coupe production totaled 112,730 with an additional 24,050 had the SS option (with an {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 305 V8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1984 Monte Carlo Brochure |url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1984_Chevrolet/1984_Chevrolet_Monte_Carlo_Brochure/1984%20Chevrolet%20Monte%20Carlo-04.html |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that saw a {{convert|5|hp|kW|abbr=on}} boost from the previous year). The Monte Carlo SS was available with Strato bucket seats and floor console as extra-cost options for the first time in place of the standard split bench seat with armrest (the Strato buckets also returned as an option on the regular Monte after a two-year absence). The regular Monte Carlo came standard with a {{convert|125|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 229&amp;nbsp;CID V6 (231&amp;nbsp;CID V6 for California) and a {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 305 V8 was optional. Available for the last year in a base Monte Carlo was the 350&amp;nbsp;CID diesel engine, and there were only 168 manufactured. All engines for 1984 got the three-speed automatic transmission with the exception of three SSs at the end of the 1984 production run that received the Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with overdrive. In 1984, there were a limited number of Monte Carlo SSs made in Mexico, for Mexican sale. The differences are many compared to US/Canadian SSs. There was no rear spoiler. The rims were 14" checker style, an option on the base Monte Carlos in the US. The side mirrors are a different style and black. The interior is from a Grand Prix and is blue in color. The engine was a 350 CID V8, and the transmission was a 4-speed manual with a Hurst shifter.

===1985–1988===
For 1985, T-tops were re-introduced because it had been discontinued after the 1983 model year and additional SS colors (Black, maroon and silver in addition to white), pinstriping, and options were made available. The (later to be highly sought after) medium blue ("gun metal") color for the SS was dropped. A four-speed automatic overdrive transmission, the Turbo Hydramatic 200-4R, with a revised sport rear axle ratio containing 3.73:1 gears became standard on the SS. Gone for good were the 229 CID V6 and 350 CID V8 diesel engines. Introduced in place of the 229 CID V6 was a [[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|262 CID (4.3 L)]] V6 (RPO LB4) that was fuel-injected with throttle-body fuel injection. The V-8's were fitted with computer controlled Quadrajet carburetors.

The 1985 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevy's rear-wheel-drive personal-luxury car, got more power, but for the first time since 1981, no diesel engine was offered in the Monte Carlo. On the base model, the previously standard 3.8&amp;nbsp;L Chevy V-6 gave way to a larger 4.3&amp;nbsp;L V-6 with throttle-body fuel injection. That brought along 20 extra horsepower, for a new total of 130. The optional 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 likewise gained some horsepower, via a jump in compression ratio. It jumped from 150 horsepower to 165. The High Output 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 in the 1985 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS remained at 180 horsepower. 10.5-inch front disc brakes were standard.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985" /&gt; A/C was $730.&lt;ref name="gunnell2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=standard catalog of American Muscle Cars 1973–2006|year=2007|publisher=krause publications|isbn=978-0-89689-490-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The V-6 and base V8 could be backed by either a three- or four-speed automatic transmission, but the H.O. V8 in the SS came only with the four-speed automatic this year. Though the base coupe carried on visually unchanged, the SS was a different story. Previously offered only in white or dark blue metallic, color choices were expanded to include silver, maroon, and black. "Removable glass roof panels" (T-tops) came on board as a midyear option.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985" /&gt; Nearly 120,000 Monte Carlos found eager buyers in 1985. Though the total was down somewhat from 1984, the SS model saw sales climb from 24,050 to 35,484, a sure sign that performance was making a comeback. The 1985 Monte Carlo SS also came stock with a 35 millimeter sway bar which added extra support for the high-performance rear end.
[[File:1986ChevroletMontelCarloAerocoupe.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Aerocoupe]]
For 1986, there were four distinct body styles available. The base model Sport Coupe was still available with the same general body panels that it had since 1981, but featured new "aero" side mirrors similar to those on Camaros and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of the 1980s . New for the 1986 model year was a Luxury Sport model that had a revised front fascia, new "aero" side mirrors, and an updated sleek-looking rear fascia. The LS front fascia included "Euro" headlights with removable bulbs in a glass composite headlamp housing, versus the smaller sealed beam glass headlights of previous years. The rear bumper of the LS no longer had a "notch" between the bumper and trunk, and the taillights wrapped around so that they were visible from the sides of the car. The Super Sport model for 1986 incorporated the "aero" mirrors, yet still utilized the prior year's styling for the rear bumper. Also new this year was the Aerocoupe model. The Aerocoupe was created by modifications to the Super Sport body, including a more deeply sloped rear window and a shorter trunk lid sporting a spoiler that lay more flat than previous Super Sports. Only 200 Aerocoupes were sold to the public, which happened to be the exact number [[NASCAR]] officials required for road model features to be incorporated into the racing cars. [http://www.montecarloss.com/86Aerocoupe.html 1986 Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe Registry &amp; Information]

In 1987, Chevrolet eliminated the Sport Coupe version of the Monte Carlo, leaving the LS, SS, and Aerocoupe. The Super Sport incorporated the "smoothed" rear bumper and tail lamps first introduced on the 1986 Luxury Sport and midway through the production year introduced the "lay-down" spoiler. The Aerocoupe made up 6,052 of the 39,251 total Super Sports that were produced that year. 39,794 Luxury Sports were produced in 1987. 1988 was the last year for the fourth-generation Monte Carlo.&lt;ref name="gunnell2007" /&gt; The 1988 models were actually built in late 1987, with only 16,204 SSs made for an asking price of US$19,320. Appearance and mechanicals were similar to the 1987 model. The 1988 model only came with the lay-down style spoiler, unlike the 1987 model, which came with either the lay-down or stand-up type spoiler. The Aerocoupe did not return, as Chevrolet had unveiled plans to produce the [[Chevrolet Lumina|Lumina]] and race that body style in [[NASCAR]]. The new Lumina body style was much more aerodynamic and negated the need for a "sleeker" version of the Monte Carlo SS. The Lumina coupe was introduced as a 1990 model to replace the Monte Carlo. Total production numbers for the final year of the rear-wheel drive Monte Carlo was 30,174 — almost half of the 1987 numbers. The final G-body Monte Carlo – a silver SS coupe — was produced on December 12, 1987 which rolled off the GM Arlington Assembly plant. Total SS production for '88 was 16,204.

For the 1995 model year, the mid-size [[Chevrolet Lumina|Lumina]] was split into two models with the sedan continuing as the Lumina and the coupe reviving the Monte Carlo nameplate for its fifth generation. The new car rode on an updated [[GM W platform|W-body]] chassis shared with the Lumina, Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, [[Oldsmobile Intrigue]], [[Buick Century]] and Buick Regal, and by its nature was the first [[front-wheel drive]] Monte Carlo. For 1995, the LS was $16,770 and the Z34 was $18,970. All 1995–1999 Monte Carlos were built in [[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada from February 14, 1994 to September 1999. Unlike Monte Carlos of previous years, the distinctive bulges to the front fenders and rear quarter panels were gone. A special run of 400 1995 Z34s were made called the Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 Pace Car. The $2195 option included interior ornamentation, embroidered leather 45/55 seating with full floor console, an aero wing spoiler, and an accent stripe package.

[[File:97 Monte Carlo Interior.jpg|thumb|left|1997 Monte Carlo LS interior]]
[[File:1995 MCb400pacecar.jpg|thumb|1995 Brickyard 400 Pace Car Edition]]

Throughout these five model years, the Monte Carlo was available in two trims, the LS and the Z34.&lt;ref name="cars.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/monte-carlo/1997/expert-reviews/?review=1&amp;reviewId=29468|title=1997 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Reviews – Cars.com|website=Cars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearances were largely identical between the two models. Styling changes consisted mainly of the special red-colored badging, a lower front air dam, and blacked out trim on the Z34, the real difference being under the hood. LS models were powered by the 3.1&amp;nbsp;L 3100 V6 putting out {{convert|160|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5200&amp;nbsp;rpm (119&amp;nbsp;kW) and 185&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (251&amp;nbsp;Nm) while Z34's featured a more powerful 3.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] V6 engine with 215&amp;nbsp;hp (160&amp;nbsp;kW) and 220&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (298&amp;nbsp;Nm). Aside from minor equipment changes, the fifth generation remained virtually unchanged during its run. In 1998, the 3.4&amp;nbsp;L was replaced with the 3800 Series II which cranked out 200&amp;nbsp;hp and 225&amp;nbsp;lb·ft of torque.

All Z34 models came with 16-inch alloy wheels, optional on LS models in place of the standard 15-inch steel wheels with bolt-on wheel covers. 1998–1999 Z34 models received redesigned 16-inch wheels, though the previous-style Z34 alloys remained on the LS.

1997 models added daytime running lights as standard to the standard dual airbags and ABS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1997-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Brochure/1997-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 18, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610183355/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1997-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-Brochure/1997-Chevrolet-Monte-Carlo-12 |archivedate=June 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear visibility was poor.&lt;ref name="cars.com" /&gt; Also, again Chevrolet made a limited production run of Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 pace cars, though none were available for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/monte-carlo/1997/expert-reviews/|title=1997 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Reviews – Cars.com|website=Cars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generation of the Monte Carlo was the last 2-door non-truck vehicle featuring 6-passenger seating, although bucket seats were available as an option with a floor-mounted shifter. Though derided by some for its indistinct lines (called the 'Lumina Carlo') and its front-wheel drive drivetrain, the fifth generation sold well enough for Chevrolet to continue the line with a more original redesign in 1999.

===2000–2005===
For 2000, Chevrolet not only again called upon GM Motorsports for design inspiration, but also to Monte Carlos of the past. Among the traits carried over from older Monte Carlos were the stylized wheel flares, vertically oriented tail lamps, and a stylized rear bumper. Another classic trait for 2000 was the return of the "knight" badging, as well as a full gauge cluster, not seen on the Monte Carlo since 1988. Back again was the Super Sport moniker, replacing the Z34 designation of the fifth generation, which was a Lumina Coupe legacy. Chevrolet also retired the Lumina name, bringing back the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] nameplate for the Monte Carlo's sedan counterpart. At the request of racing teams, Chevrolet stylists added a slight "hump" on the rear trunk – similar to, although smaller than, a [[Lincoln Mark series#Mark VIII (1993–1998)|Lincoln Mark VIII]]. It was a distinct trait that stayed with Monte Carlo until its demise, even though later in the generation every trim level would get a spoiler that all but masked the hump. From the NASCAR circuit came the aerodynamic styling and duck tail spoiler. The 6th generation Monte Carlo is based on the Monte Carlo "Intimidator" concept car, produced in 1997. Trim levels initially consisted of the LS, and SS, the latter being the first front-wheel drive SS in the Chevrolet lineup. The LS used a 3.4&amp;nbsp;L OHV V6, while the SS got the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6. A [[Supercharged]] ''SS'' model was added for 2004 and 2005; the naturally aspirated ''SS'' continued as well, but was relabeled as ''LT'' for MY 2005.

===2006–2007===
[[File:2006-2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS.jpg|thumb|left|2006–2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS]]

The facelifted 2006 Monte Carlo and the companion [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] sedan were introduced at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show#2005|2005 Los Angeles Auto Show]]. The base engine was a 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 producing 211&amp;nbsp;hp (156&amp;nbsp;kW). Trim series for this generation include the entry level LS, the mid level LT, the upper level LTZ and, the top of the line SS. Only 14,829 SS models were produced over the two years, 8,794 in 2006 and 6,035 in 2007. The most notable news, though, was the ''SS'' model's use of the [[GM LS engine|generation IV small-block]] V8 — the first V8 since the 1988 model. The 5.3&amp;nbsp;L V8 produced 303&amp;nbsp;hp (226&amp;nbsp;kW). The interior for 2006 was mildly redesigned.

The revised model also added an improved interior with expanded Driver Information Center (DIC), enhanced ABS and traction control, as well as optional, seat-mounted side air bags for the front driver and passenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/chevrolet/2006-chevrolet-monte-carlo-ar3431.html|website=TopSpeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LT and LTZ model were available with the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L engine in 2006. For 2007 the LTZ model was dropped along with the engine in favor of utilizing the [[Flex Fuel]] 3.5&amp;nbsp;L as the exclusive engine for non-SS models.

===Specialty nameplates===
Chevrolet released several models inspired by then-current NASCAR drivers:
The first model released was the 2002 [[Dale Earnhardt]] Signature Edition, also referred to as Intimidator Edition. This car had two color schemes; a black body with galaxy silver rocker panels and front and rear air dams, and an all black body with black ground effects. A thin red stripe above the silver ground effects was also included. Just behind the rear side windows, the Dale Number 3 logo was placed with Earnhardt's signature below the Number 3 logo. The car also featured silver "Intimidator" SS badges on the right side of the trunk and standard Monte Carlo SS badges the bottom of the vehicle, just in front of the rear tires. An Intimidator badge with the number 3 also appeared on the dash, and Earnhardt’s signature appeared on the gauge cluster. The interior is all black ("charcoal") leather. This edition also came with 5 spoke, diamond cut wheels and received GMs L36 3800 V6 engine.

In 2003, the [[Jeff Gordon]] edition was released. The vehicle came with a superior blue body and silver ground effects, just like the Intimidator Edition; however, the Jeff Gordon edition also received lighter blue ghost flames on the body. It featured the number 24 behind the rear side windows. A Jeff Gordon signature was placed on the right side of the trunk and inside the car received a Jeff Gordon badge on the dash board and a two-tone gray a black leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. It featured the 5 spoke, diamond cut wheels and received GMs L36 3800 V6 engine.

In 2004 the [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|Dale Jr.]] Edition came out, it was red in color and sported a black high sport kit. The number 8, with an “E” stripe design carried from the doors to the rear bumper. The 5 spoke diamond cut wheels featured a black stripe through each spoke and Dale Jr.'s signature appeared on the right side of the trunk lid. On the sides, the vehicle received Supercharged SS badges. Inside on the dash a #8 badge appeared and Dale Jr.'s signature on the cluster. This edition also got #8 floor mats and headrests. This was also the first nameplate car to receive GMs L67 Supercharged 3800 V6 engine. They changed the fan speed for heat and air conditioning this year. previous years had 1-5 settings. Monte Carlo will now come with 10 dots to mark your fan speed.

To compete, the Intimidator Edition was re-released in 2004, this time, however the vehicle featured "Intimidator" badges on the trunk lid and both side panels of the vehicle. The car was all black in color, received the 5 spoke, diamond cut wheels and this time received GMs L67 Supercharged 3800 V6 engine.

2005 marked the next and final nameplate, the [[Tony Stewart]] edition. It was all black, but featured a white/orange line that thickened as it reached the back of the vehicle and contained number 20 just before the rear tires. Tony Stewart’s signature also appeared behind the rear windows on both sides. The Chevy bowtie on the trunk was white on this edition and another was painted on the front of the hood. The Monte Carlo badge was removed and instead replaced by the black Tony Stewart grille. The wheels were the same design as the Dale Jr. Edition, except the bowtie on the center cap was white this time. This edition also received GMs L67 Supercharged 3800 V6 engine.

===Pace Car Editions===
[[File:2003 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Pace Car edition front.jpg|thumb|2003 Pace Car edition]]
General Motors released several Monte Carlos branded as "Pace Car" replicas. Each year featured a different color and all cars were limited to production numbers, however; all cars did have some things in common. All pace cars received:

Production of the 2006–2007 SS totaled 14,829 units.

==Discontinuation==
The Monte Carlo ceased production at [[Oshawa Car Assembly]] Plant #1 on June 19, 2007, following an announcement in February 2007 of its demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Left Lane News |title= Monte Carlo production to end |date=March 1, 2007 |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/chevrolet-monte-carlo-production-to-end.html |accessdate=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Tuesday, June 19, 2007, the last two 2007 Chevrolet Monte Carlo models rolled off the line at the Oshawa Assembly Plant. The last two models were identical "SS" models with Precision Red exterior paint, silver rally stripes, and Ebony Nuance leather interior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=General Motors |title=GM Online Auction: News |date=August 2007 |url=http://www.gmonlineauctions.com/news/index.html#home_story |accessdate=August 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219183730/http://gmonlineauctions.com/news/index.html#home_story |archivedate=February 19, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was discontinued due to declining sales in coupes in general and the company's plans to revive the [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|Chevrolet Camaro]], which would cannibalize sales of the Monte Carlo.

The final Monte Carlo off the production line was retained by GM for their Heritage Center collection. The second-to-last Monte off the line, the last "saleable" unit, was auctioned off on August 15, at Manheim's Statesville Auto Auction in [[Statesville, North Carolina]]. The winning bid went to Fred Simon, owner of Simon Chevrolet in [[Woonsocket, RI]] where it is on display on the dealership floor. This unit was at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] over the weekend of July 27–29 for the 2007 [[Allstate 400 at the Brickyard]]. While there, it was signed by all the current Team Chevrolet drivers who were active in the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]].

==NASCAR==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Chevrolet Monte Carlo NASCAR (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|right|Chevrolet Monte Carlo painted to look like a stock car (in this case, the #29 car, driven by [[Kevin Harvick]]).]]
From 1972 until the car's end of production in 1988, the Monte Carlo was campaigned in [[NASCAR]] racing. The 1973–1977 cars were the dominant body style through the years until 1980, when NASCAR mandated a move to the shorter {{convert|110|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase cars being built by Detroit. The 1981 and 1982 (referred to as the "flat-nose") Monte Carlo was raced by few teams and only won two races in those years. In 1983, the addition of the ''SS'' nose became the Monte Carlo body style used in NASCAR until the car went out of production.

[[File:DarrellWaltrip1997Pocono.jpg|right|thumb|[[Darrell Waltrip]] in a Monte Carlo in 1997]]
The Monte Carlo returned for the 1995 season with the fifth-generation body, but NASCAR allowed the car to have wider rear quarter panels, and as such deviated from ''factory'' sheetmetal, that up until that time the race spec cars had to use. The 1995 bodystyle was also a favorite on the NASCAR circuit and enjoyed considerable success at the track. The car captured several NASCAR Manufacturers Cup awards until it again was discontinued from production in 2007, and replaced by the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] for racing.

The '''Chevrolet Triax''' was a [[concept car]] created by [[Chevrolet]]. It was shown at the [[North American International Auto Show#2000|2000 North American International Auto Show]]. The Triax has three different propulsion systems.

==How The Triax Works==
The Triax uses a 0.66 L V3 engine with normal aspiration and induction. It uses an AWD automatic transmission with a total of four gears. The Triax has three different propulsion systems. It lets the driver switch between four-wheel-drive electric, four-wheel-drive hybrid electric or two-wheel-drive internal combustion.

The '''Chevrolet Celta''', also known as '''Suzuki Fun''' in [[Argentina]], was a [[no frills|low cost]] [[supermini]] car produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the [[Latin America]]n market since 2000 until 2015. A [[sedan (car)|sedan]] version is marketed as the '''Chevrolet Prisma'''. 600,000 Celtas have been built in [[Gravataí]], more than one hundred thousand per year.

==Evolution==
[[File:Chevrolet_Celta_20150825-IMG_20150825_140732.JPG|thumb|left|First generation Chevrolet Celta]]
[[File:Chevrolet Celta 20150825-IMG 20150825 140745.JPG|thumbnail|left|Rear view]]
It was released in 2000 in Brazil as a three-door [[hatchback]] with a {{convert|60|PS|abbr=on}} {{convert|1.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[gasoline engine]], based on the [[Opel Corsa|Corsa B]] and with design features similar to those of the [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]]. In 2002 a five-door version was made available, and the engine power was increased to {{convert|70|PS}} at 6,400&amp;nbsp;rpm, the same VHC (Very High Compression) technology used in the Latin American Corsa C. A {{convert|85|PS|abbr=on}} {{convert|1.4|L|abbr=on}} gasoline engine was added in 2003.
[[File:Brazilian Chevrolet Celta FlexPower four views 10 2008.jpg|left|thumb|Details of the [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex fuel]] version of the Chevrolet Celta]]
[[File:Chevrolet Prisma 20150902-IMG 20150902 143712.JPG|thumb|right|Chevrolet Prisma]]
[[File:Chevrolet Prisma 20150902-IMG 20150902 143656.JPG|thumb|right|Chevrolet Prisma]]

An "Off-Road" accessories kit was for sale for both old and new Celtas in 2005, and the 1.0&amp;nbsp;L was converted into a gasoline-ethanol [[flexible fuel engine]] (gasoline versions are still available, especially outside Brazil).

In 2006, the Celta underwent a facelift, which provided for a more modern look and an enhancement of build quality. The new front fascia makes it closer to new Chevrolet models, especially the new Brazilian [[Opel Vectra|Vectra]].

A sedan version, named '''Chevrolet Prisma''' was released in early 2007. It was not meant to replace Classic (a [[low cost]] sedan version of the Corsa B) neither the Corsa Sedan (C), but to fill a market gap between them instead. The only available engine option is a 1.4&amp;nbsp;L Econo.Flex gasoline/ethanol flexible fuel engine. Its high compression rate gives as a result a maximum output of 97&amp;nbsp;PS when running on ethanol and 95&amp;nbsp;hp when running on gasoline.

Early 2009 marked the release of the Prisma 1.0 litre and the new VHC-E engine ({{convert|77|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} gasoline and {{convert|78|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} ethanol) for Prisma and Celta. By early 2012, 1.5 million Celtas had been built in Gravataí.

==Safety==
The Chevrolet Celta has been rated as highly unsafe by [[Latin NCAP]] in 2011, scoring only one star for adult occupants and two stars for children. Important to mention that when Celta was developed (1996) there was no Latin NCAP protocol available and that all regulatory safety items were met for the countries were Celta was sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinncap.com/data/pdf/chevrolet-celta-en.pdf Latin NCAP report] Chevrolet Celta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
The 1.0&amp;nbsp;L gasoline engine has a high power to displacement ratio (51&amp;nbsp;kW/L, 70&amp;nbsp;PS/L or 1.1&amp;nbsp;hp/cu&amp;nbsp;in). However, this power is only available at 6400&amp;nbsp;rpm, and the maximum torque is 8.6&amp;nbsp;kgf·m (88&amp;nbsp;N·m) at 3000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Today, the Celta is sold only with the 1.0 FlexPower (the 1.4 MPFI stopping production in 2007). In 2002 GM changed the 1.0 MPFI ({{convert|60|PS|abbr=on|disp=or}}) engine to a 1.0 VHC ({{convert|70|PS|abbr=on|disp=or}}), in 2005 to VHC FlexPower (70&amp;nbsp;PS with Petrol or alcohol), and in 2009 to VHCE FlexPower (77&amp;nbsp;PS with Petrol and 78&amp;nbsp;PS with alcohol). The total weight is approximately 850&amp;nbsp;kg (1,872&amp;nbsp;lb). In Uruguay, Celta 1.4 MPFI are available since 2009 as the 'new' Celta with the new front lights and all facelift add-ons. This model continues on sell in 2012 and manufacturing dates of the units are from 2011 (1.4 MPFI engines didn't stop production in 2007).

==Replacement==
In 2012, General Motors announced the new [[Chevrolet Onix]] to succeed part of versions of Celta.

The '''Chevrolet Tavera''' is a [[compact MPV]] and [[compact SUV]] that was produced in [[Indonesia]] by Japanese automaker [[Isuzu Motors|Isuzu]] until 2007, and in India by American automaker [[Chevrolet]] until 2017, when [[General Motors]] exited the Indian market&lt;ref&gt;http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/05/general-motors-restructures-international-business-unit/&lt;/ref&gt;. The Tavera was sold in [[ASEAN]] and Indian markets, and it uses the platform of the [[Isuzu Panther]], a [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered multi-purpose vehicle sold in Indonesia. In other markets it is known as the Isuzu AUV, HiLander or Crosswind.
The name of the vehicle comes from the name of the small French village, [[Tavera]], in Corsica, known for its steep paths and whose CEO Isuzu, [[Susumu Hosoi]] is used to test his vehicles.
In India, this MUV's main competition includes such vehicles like the [[Toyota Innova]], [[Mahindra Bolero Camper|Mahindra Bolero]], [[Tata Sumo]], and similar vehicles. Unlike some MUVs like the Fusion (which is based on the [[Ford Fiesta]] and also sold in [[Europe]]), this MUV is based on a [[pickup truck]], in this case a modified Isuzu Vega.

==History==
[[File:Chevrolet Tavera (belakang), Denpasar.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Tavera (Indonesia)]]
[[Isuzu]] designed the original Tavera, based on the ''Panther''.  [[Chevrolet]]'s version is based on facelift version of the Panther, which is more designed for businesses and more focused on passenger rather than commercial use.

In India, there are 2 versions of the Tavera, the original Tavera, the base model which includes the B1 and B2 trims, and the Tavera neo 2 (this version was called simply Tavera neo before the Indian Tavera facelift, and before that Tavera Elite), the normal version which includes the LS-B3, the LS-B4, the LT-L and the high-end SS-D1. In 2006, because of Chevrolet's marketing of their Indian lineup as "an Indian revolution" (similar to their US marketing campaign), the Tavera is now sold as two models. The original Tavera is still being sold; however more upmarket models in India are now sold as the "Tavera Neo 2". In September of the same year, the Indian Tavera got a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]]. The facelift included the front grille and revised interiors. Later again a facelift which includes revised front lights and bumpers and introduced as Tavera Neo 3. The Indian Tavera was built with [[knock-down kit]] sourced from Isuzu Indonesia.

In [[Indonesia]], Tavera served as a [[petrol]] version of [[Isuzu Panther]], while the latter has only diesel engine. It has 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[gasoline]], {{convert|114|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} &amp; {{convert|180|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} Australian sourced Holden engine, which also used by Indonesian version of [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer#Second generation (1995–2005)|Opel/Chevrolet Blazer]].

== 2013 recall in India ==
In July 2013, General Motors recalled 114,000 Chevrolet Taveras in India, as the vehicle failed to meet local emission standards. GM India also were ordered to suspend the production of the Tavera until the issues were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324110404578625500571971238 GM India Recalling 114,000 Chevrolet SUVs&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Svenska Dagbladet]] reported that employees of General Motors had misled Indian authorities about the exhaust emission and fuel consumption by equipping vehicles to be tested with smaller and specially prepared engines to pass regulations. As a result of this, GM's powertrain division manager Sam Winegarden was fired, along with other employees. The report led to the Indian authorities starting an investigation into General Motors' practices.&lt;ref name=svd_2013juli29&gt;{{cite news|title=GM sparkar toppchef efter fusk i Indien|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/motor/gm-sparkar-toppchef-efter-fusk-i-indien_8381986.svd|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Reference in Svenska Dagbladet is not an original source: it just references a press release and a different article in Automotive News|date=January 2014}}

The '''Chevrolet Opala''' was a Brazilian [[executive car]] sold under the [[Chevrolet]] brand in [[South America]] from 1969 to 1992, by [[General Motors do Brasil]]. It was derived from the German [[Opel Rekord Series C]], [[Opel Commodore#Commodore A .281967.E2.80.931971.29|Opel Commodore Series A]], but used local design styling{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} and engines sourced from [[North America]]. GM manufactured about one million units including the Opala [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], Opala [[Coupé]], and the [[station wagon]] variant, the '''Opala Caravan'''. It was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Omega]] in 1992, also an Opel spinoff. It was the first passenger car built by GM in Brazil by the [[General Motors do Brasil]] division. A luxury version of the Opala was marketed as the '''Chevrolet Diplomata'''.

It was used by the [[Brazil]]ian [[Federal Police Department|Federal Police]] for many years. The [[Brazilian military government|military government]] issued Opalas to its agents through the 1970s. Its reliability and easy maintenance made the Opala the choice of many [[Taxicab|taxi]] drivers and was also popular on racetracks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The Opala "Coupé" continued as a pillarless [[hardtop]] well into the late 1980s, long after U.S. automakers dropped the body style.

The Opala's long-lived 250-cubic-inch (4.1 L) engine was also used in its replacement, the Chevrolet Omega (which featured [[Fuel injection|electronic fuel injection]] in the GLS and CD trims) from 1995 to 1998. Some of the Opalas components and chassis were used in other Brazilian cars such as the [[Santa Matilde]], Puma GTB, and the Fera XK (a Jaguar XK replica).

==Early history==
Founded in January 1925, [[General Motors do Brasil]] originally only assembled, and later, manufactured, light trucks and [[coupe utility|utilities]] until the mid-1960s, when they decided to produce their first Brazilian-made passenger car.

The options varied between the traditional, large, more expensive American-style cars that GM was already selling in the United States line, such as the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], and the lighter and more economical models from German GM-subsidiary Opel (such as the [[Opel Kadett|Kadett]], [[Opel Olympia|Olympia]], [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]] and [[Opel Commodore|Commodore]]) which were already imported to Brazil in small quantities. After wavering between the small Kadett and the somewhat larger Rekord/Commodore line, GMB opted for the latter, but later introduced the Kadett as well.

On November 23, 1966, in a [[News conference|Press Conference]] at the Club Atlético Paulistano in [[São Paulo]], GM publicly announced "Project 676", which would become the Chevrolet Opala.

==Name==
The name Opala may come from the [[opal]], which is a precious stone, colourless when extracted from the soil, but which acquires multiple tones when exposed to light. Some commented that the name was a portmanteau of the brand name "[[Opel]]", and the [[Chevrolet Impala|Chevy Impala]], as the model was derived from the German [[Opel Rekord]], and one of its engines (the 230 in³, and later, 250 in³ [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|Chevrolet straight-six]]) was also used in the North American [[Chevrolet Impala]]. GM claims that this was not their intention, as the name Opala - one of six finalists from thousands of suggestions - was chosen by a journalist. Its rapid acceptance with the general public led to the approval of the choice.

==Debut==
At the opening of the sixth São Paulo Auto Show, on November 23, 1968, the Opala appeared on a rotating stage on a {{convert|16140|sqft|m2}} stand. Around the novelty there were several spectacles, including an appearance by [[Stirling Moss]]. Several Opala models were shown every half-hour.

[[File:Opala.jpg|thumb|1975-79 Chevrolet Opala coupé]]
[[File:Chevrolet Opala SS 19744.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Opala SS 1974]]
The first model was the four-door sedan in the trims "Especial" (Special) and "Luxo" (Deluxe). Its attractive lines curved from the windscreen to rear fender, a styling practice that was referred to as "[[Coke bottle styling|Coke Bottle styling]]", already in use at the time on the sporty 1967 [[Chevrolet Camaro]], [[Pontiac Firebird]] and the 1968 [[Chevrolet Corvette]], among numerous others, but hints of the upcoming style were already clear on the more "family"-oriented 1965 [[Chevrolet Impala]] fastback coupé. A hardtop coupe was also offered with a silhouette resembling the first-generation Camaro/Firebird.  The round headlamps (not squared, as in the Opel Rekord and Commodore), egg-crate grille, styling cues borrowed from the 1968 [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevy II]] Nova, and lamps fitted below the front bumper separated the Opala from its European Opel siblings. In the back, a chrome strip with "Chevrolet" in black was included with the more expensive trim. Small rectangular taillights (similar to those on the American 1967 Chevelle) were mounted on the tip of the rear overhang, and small reverse lights were mounted in the rear bumper, just below the fuel tank cap. An "Opala" badge (spelled in a similar font to the American Chevrolet Impala badge) was fitted on the rear fenders, and the badges denoting the rounded displacement of the engine in cubic centimeters (2500 or 3800, later 4100 as well) were placed next to the front doors. Chrome [[hubcap]]s complemented the [[whitewall tire]]s.

Both versions came standard with front [[bench seat]]s ([[bucket seat]]s weren't available early in production, but were later introduced) and column-mounted [[Gear stick|shifter lever]]. Reverse lights, fuel tank lock, and rear valance chrome strip were available only on the "Luxo" trim level.In 2016 Rogério Ferraresi, in the city of São Paulo, created a pedal car of the Chevrolet Opala. It was the first time that this type of toy based on an Opala was produced. [[c:File:Opala_Pedal_Car_(1).jpg|1]] [[c:File:Opala_Pedal_Car_(2).jpg|2]] [[c:File:Opala_Pedal_Car_(3).jpg|3]]

===Development===
[[File:1990 Chevrolet Diplomata 4.1 SE.jpg|thumb|1990 Chevrolet Diplomata 4.1 SE]]
In the fall of 1970, a more luxurious version was added called '''Comodoro''', reflecting Europe's [[Opel Commodore]]. The Comodoro-4 received a somewhat more powerful version of the 2.5 liter four cylinder engine in some model years, with {{convert|88|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} rather than {{convert|80|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The same engine was used in the Opala SS-4.&lt;ref name="AR82"&gt;{{cite journal | ref = AR82 | title = Automobil Revue '82 | editor-last = Büschi | editor-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag, AG | language = German, French | page = 246 | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 77 | date = March 3, 1982 | isbn = 3-444-06062-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more luxurious was the '''Diplomata''', which was released in November 1979.&lt;ref name="AR82"/&gt;

Under the hood, which hinged forwards, in the European style, the Opala originally offered only two engine choices: a {{convert|2512|cc|CID|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} [[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|four-cylinder]] and a {{convert|3768|cc|CID|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|straight-six]]. These engine were of traditional design for the era, with cast iron [[cylinder block]] and [[Cylinder head|head]], and [[Overhead valve engine|overhead valves]], actuated by pushrods and a [[camshaft]] mounted in the block, and pressed-steel [[rocker arm]]s, whose spherical fulcrum was GM's proprietary design. Fuel was fed from either single or double-barrel [[carburetor]]s. The engines had already been used for years in the USA: the 153&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in four had debuted in the 1962 [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevy II]]—becoming the first inline four in a Chevrolet since 1928—and the 230&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in six appeared in the 1963 Impala.  The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L six-cylinder was replaced by a bigger ({{convert|4093|cc|CID|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) version in 1971. In 1973 GM do Brasil engineers decreased the four-cylinder engine's stroke to 3 inches and increased the length of the connecting rods to 6 inches to reduce vibrations, and simultaneously increased the bores to 4 inches diameter to keep the overall displacement ({{convert|2471|cc|CID|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) similar to what it had been.&lt;ref name="SAE770819"&gt;{{cite conference | last   = Sawruk | first  = John M. | title = Pontiac's New 2.5 Litre 4 Cylinder Engine |format=PDF |conference=Society of Automotive Engineers: Passenger Car Meeting |pages=1-2 |date=26-30 September 1977 |location=Detroit |url=https://gafiero.akroncdnr.com/docs/IronDuke.pdf |access-date=10 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205132841/https://gafiero.akroncdnr.com/docs/IronDuke.pdf |archive-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The bore and stroke of this Brazilian engine are exactly the same as the later [[Iron Duke engine]] designed and built by [[Pontiac]], but the two engines are otherwise unrelated and do not share any parts.)&lt;ref name="SAE770819" /&gt;

[[File:Chevrolet Opala 4dr.jpg|thumb|Facelifted four-door Opala, rear view]]
The six-cylinder engine's [[crankshaft]] had seven [[main bearing]]s (there were five main bearings in the four-cylinders) and the generous (if not redundant) size of its inner moving parts attributed to its durability and exceptional smoothness. The hydraulic valve lifters made for easy maintenance. The straight-six's biggest limitation through the years was poor distribution of [[Air–fuel ratio|air-fuel mixture]] to the cylinders due to a sub-optimal intake manifold design. Cylinders one and six (on the ends of the engine), received the lowest ratio, with a higher percentage of air in the mixture, while the central ones tended to get a richer mixture, unbalancing the engine's stoichiometric efficiency. Basically, in order to ensure the outer cylinders received a high enough air/fuel ratio to avoid [[Engine knocking|detonation]], the carburetor had to be set to run overly rich, which wasted fuel).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} This design flaw could easily be solved by installing a race intake manifold that sported two or three two-barrel carburetors, as in stock car racing. Only in 1994, with the arrival of [[Fuel injection|multipoint injection]] in the [[Chevrolet Omega|Omega]], was this problem finally addressed.

The performance of Opala 3.8&amp;nbsp;L was actually quite pleasing; with a top speed of {{convert|112.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and acceleration from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in about 11 seconds, it was the fastest Brazilian car of its time{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, losing the title the following year to the [[Dodge Dart]] whose [[Chrysler LA engine|318ci]] V8 had more power and torque. The 2.5&amp;nbsp;L fours did not offer as much vigor, but had enough torque enough for everyday use. The main complaint with the four-cylinder engines was their roughness—so rough that GM employees of the time called the engine "little Toyota", in allusion to the diesel engine installed in the locally built [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J40)|Toyota Bandeirante]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Both the Especial and Luxo had a [[Manual transmission|manual gearbox]], [[rear wheel drive]], front [[independent suspension]] and rear [[Beam axle|live axle]], both with [[coil spring]]s. In front, the suspension components were anchored to one side, set in the [[unibody]] with screws, later known as the [[subframe]]. The tires were the first [[tubeless]] tires used on a car manufactured in [[Brazil]]. It had a diaphragmatic (or "Chinese hat") clutch spring, which was becoming popular throughout the world. The Opala SS, originally only available with the "250" engine, was the first version to receive a four-speed manual gearbox. This was coupled with a [[tachometer]] and matte black paint striping.&lt;ref name=WC72&gt;{{Cite book | title = World Cars 1972 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Bronxville, NY | pages = 266–267 | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-910714-04-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===250-S===
When endurance races resumed in Brazil in 1973, the Opala found a great competitor, the [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Ford Maverick]], which was powered by an engine with a displacement almost a full liter larger. It took Bob Sharp and Jan Balder, who placed second in the "24 Hours of Interlagos" in August of that year with an Opala, to convince GM do Brasil to field a more powerful engine.

By coincidence, engine development manager Roberto B. Beccardi was already working on an engine hop-up project on his own, but GMB wasn't interested in it until Sharp and Balder's loss.

Thus, in July 1974, GMB introduced the 250-S engine as an option for the Opala 4100. It was slightly different from the version that would be launched two years later: it didn't have a vibration dampener and the cooling fan came from the standard 2500, with four blades instead of six.

The Opala was now much faster than the Maverick GT, and [[Ford]] did not waste time. It quickly homologated a version of the Maverick with a four-barrel carburetor. On the racetrack, the determining factor for victory was the driver's skill and the pit crew's organization. The rivals walked side by side.

The '''Chevrolet Beauville''' was originally a [[station wagon]] option for the 1954 [[Chevrolet Bel Air]].  The name was later resurrected as a full-size [[van]] option for the [[Chevrolet Van]] in 1970. Both were related to the lower trim level [[Chevrolet Townsman]].

==1954==
In 1954 Chevrolet introduced the 4-door Beauville Wagon as an option for the Bel Air Line. It came standard with a [[Straight-6|6-cylinder]] engine and featured woodgrain trim around the side windows.

==1955==
In 1955 the 4-door Beauville Wagon came standard with a [[Straight-6|6-cylinder]] engine or a [[V8 engine|V8]] mated to a [[manual transmission]].

===Engines===
Chevrolet Station wagons offered a wide variety of engines rated from the {{Convert|140|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} 6-cylinder to the {{Convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8. 

One base engine Chevrolet offered in 1956 was a {{convert|235.5|cuin|cc|sing=on}} 6-cylinder engine with a cast-iron block and a compression ratio of 8.0:1.  It was carbureted, with a Rochester single barrel [[carburetor]] and produced {{convert|140|bhp|kW}} power at 4200 [[revolutions per minute]]. Another base engine offered by Chevrolet in 1956 was a {{convert|265|cuin|cc|sing=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] with a 2-barrel carburetor with {{convert|162|bhp|kW}} at 4400 rpm.

In 1956 two other {{convert|265|cuin|cc|sing=on}} V8s were offered but both had a 9.25:1 [[compression ratio]], 4-barrel carburetors, and a dual exhaust. The [[Turbo-Fire 225]] engine was equipped with 2 Carter 4-barrel carburetors and produced {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm while the Turbo-Fire 205 engine had a single 4-barrel carburetor with a peak {{Convert|205|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4600 rpm.

==1957==
In 1957 the Beauville station wagon was not offered in the Bel Air line, only in the 210.

The '''Chevrolet Two-Ten''', or '''210''', was the midrange model of the [[Chevrolet]] car from 1953 to 1957.  It took its name by shortening the production series number (2100) by one digit in order to capitalize on the 1950s trend toward numerical auto names.  The numerical designation '"210"' was also sporadically used in company literature. It replaced the Styleline DeLuxe model available in previous years. The Two-Ten was discontinued after the 1957 model year to be replaced by the [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]].

== History ==
The Two-Ten series, introduced for the 1953 model year, replaced the Styleline DeLuxe series.  It was actually the best-selling Chevrolet model during 1953 and 54, offering a balance of style and luxury appointments unavailable in the base [[Chevrolet 150|150]] series, but was less costly than the glitzy Bel Air.  Two-Tens offered the widest choice of body styles for 1953, including a convertible, Sport Coupe hardtop, two- and four-door sedans, and four-door station wagons.

As the American public began to prefer posh to economy, the Bel Air began to outsell the lesser series, including both 150 and 210 models.  As a partial answer to this, Chevrolet re-introduced the Two-Ten Sport Coupe hardtop in the middle of the 1955 model year, and also added a four-door Two-Ten hardtop Sport Sedan for 1956.  Neither achieved the sales of their Bel Air counterparts, however, since they were only about $100.00 cheaper than the Bel Airs, which provided more luxury and premium exterior trim.

Unlike the 150 series, Two-Tens were always available with the same luxury options as the Bel Air, including the Powerglide [[automatic transmission]], power window lifts and seat adjuster.  The [[Chevrolet Townsman|Two-Ten Townsman]] was the top station wagon model offered in 1953, but the Townsman was moved up to the Bel Air series for 1954, only to return to the Two-Ten for 1955. The lower-priced Handyman station wagon, a four-door model in 1953–54, became a two-door for 1955–57. Both were joined by a nine-passenger [[Chevrolet Beauville|Beauville]] four-door wagon in 1956–57.

=== 1953–1954 models ===
First years for the Two-Ten. These model years are essentially the same except for minor front and rear trim items, and of course the reduced model offering in 1954.  Turn signal indicators on 1953 dashboards were white, green in 1954.

==== Powertrains ====

Two engines were used in each of the '53-'54 model years, the more powerful Blue Flame unit used with the Powerglide [[automatic transmission]].  All Two-Tens had a three-speed [[Synchromesh]] [[manual transmission]] as standard, with two optional transmissions (see below).  All engines are of the overhead valve (OHV) design.  They are commonly referred to as "Stovebolt Sixes" because of the large slotted-head screws used to fasten the valve cover and pushrod covers to the block.  1954 was the last year for 6 volt electrical systems in Chevrolet vehicles.

=== 1955 ===
The '55 model year marks the introduction of a new chassis and the debut of the [[small block]] V8. The center door frame was beefed up for more safety.&lt;ref name=Oldcarbrochures&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure/1955%20Chevrolet%20Prestige-16-17.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet/1955_Chevrolet_Prestige_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brakes were {{convert|11|in|mm|sing=on}} drums.&lt;ref name=Oldcarbrochures/&gt; The Two-Ten buyer was free to choose any powertrain option available. The ammeter and oil pressure gauges were changed to warning lights.

This was not the first Chevrolet to have a V8 engine installed. The first Chevrolet with a V8 engine was introduced in 1917 called the [[Chevrolet Series D|Series D]] which was built for two years, and was manufactured before Chevrolet joined [[General Motors]].

=== 1956 ===

Engine choices remain the same except they were now rated with higher power output. The {{convert|265|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] was available in three versions. The [[Straight-six engine|I6]] had a new unified build no matter the transmission.

=== 1957 ===
New for 1957 was the optional {{convert|283|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} small-block [[V8 engine]]. There were three versions of this engine with conventional carburetors, as well as a fuel injected option.

The Two-Ten shared the wedge-shaped side trim with the Bel Air, but unlike the Bel Air (which had the wedge filled with an aluminum trim panel) the Two-Ten's wedge was painted either body color, or top color with the optional two-tone paint package.  "Chevrolet" in script was mounted inside the wedge.

== Today ==
Today, the Bel Air series of Chevrolets from 1953 to 1957 are far and away the most desirable models for collectors.  However, Two-Ten models do have appeal, especially the 1953 convertible (very rare), the Del Ray Club Coupe with its upgraded vinyl interior, and the Sport Coupe hardtops of 1953 and 1955-57.  Other models are less valuable, but again, can be purchased for less money than Bel Airs, for Chevy collectors on a budget.  Unlike the One-Fifty series, Two-Tens do sport a fair amount of chrome trim and de luxe interior appointments, making them attractive and comfortable.

The '''Chevrolet Express''' and its mechanically identical twin '''GMC Savana''' are [[full-size van]]s from [[General Motors]]. They replaced the [[Chevrolet Van]] and [[GMC Vandura]] in 1995. The Express and Savana, known as the GMT600 platform, was a refreshed change from the previous generation van.  The GMT600 featured full body on frame construction, the new central-port injection V6 and V8 engines, and greatly improved ride and handling from its GMT400-derived chassis.  

After 2003, the Express and Savana had updated front-end sheet metal similar to the [[GMT800]] light trucks and [[GMT360]] SUVs, and were fitted with the LS (Gen III) engines. The remainder of the body was not modified. This redesign was designated as the GMT610. In 2004, Stability Control ([[StabiliTrak]]) was added to all passenger vans. In 2008, the interior was updated and side impact roof airbags were standard on all passenger models. They also offer the [[E85]] [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|Flexfuel]] Vortec 5.3L V8 engine in both the 2008 Express 1500 Work Van and Passenger Van. The 6.6L [[Duramax V8 engine]] Diesel was added as an option for 2006.

In 2017, a new 2.8L Duramax Diesel engine was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/express/cargo-van|title=2018 Express Cargo Van: Work Van|website=www.chevrolet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018, a new 6.0L V8 gaseous CNG/LPG capable engine was added. In 2018, conventional sealed beam headlights were discontinued for the base models, and the composite headlights found on higher trims became standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmc.com/vans/savana-passenger-van|title=2018 Savana Passenger Van|website=www.gmc.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For 2021, a 6.6L V8 engine introduced in the 2020 [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado/Sierra HD]] was added, replacing both 6.0L V8 engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/03/2021-chevrolet-express-receives-new-6-6l-v8-gas-engine/|title=2021 Chevrolet Express Receives New 6.6L V8 Gas Engine|publisher=GM Authority|date=2020-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chevy Express Cargo===
The cargo variety of the Express/Savana is popular as a work vehicle, often used by [[electrician]]s, [[plumber]]s, and others needing to haul a variety of large items. In this way, it is the North American equivalent of the ubiquitous [[white van man|white vans]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In the [[Netherlands]], the Express is in common use as an [[ambulance]], although its popularity is declining because of the high fuel consumption and small interior space compared to European vans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bndestem.nl/extra/auto/ambulance-is-verlengstuk-van-jezelf-1.3289376 |title=‘Ambulance is verlengstuk van jezelf’ |publisher=BN DeStem |date=2012-11-01 |access-date=2014-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032753/http://www.bndestem.nl/extra/auto/ambulance-is-verlengstuk-van-jezelf-1.3289376 |archivedate=2014-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chevy Express Passenger ===
The Express/Savana is also available as a passenger van, seating 8 to 15 passengers, depending on the model, and is often used as a [[tow truck]], [[ambulance]], [[Public transport bus service#Specialist services|shuttle bus]], or [[school bus]]. Both the cargo and passenger models, as well as the [[cutaway van]] versions, often serve as the basis for [[conversion van]]s, [[motorhome]]s, and wheelchair accessible vans. As of mid-2014, half-ton Chevy Express vans and its cousin the GMC Savana have been discontinued. It was replaced by a Nissan-GM partnership badged Chevy City Express in the U.S. Only the 3/4-ton and 1-ton full size vans will be available as previous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/chevrolet-express-1500-gmc-savana-1500-dropped-from-lineup-for-2015.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chevy Express Concept===
{{Main|Chevrolet Express (concept car)}}
Chevrolet Express was also the name of a [[Chevrolet Express (concept car)|concept car]] first shown in 1987.  It was a turbine powered, drive-by-wire car made to show the possibilities of future limited-access highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z4903/Chevrolet_Express/default.aspx |title=1987 Chevrolet Express Images, Information and History |publisher=Conceptcarz.com |date= |access-date=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It's not related to the production model.

==History==
===2012 recall===
On August 14, 2012, GM issued a recall for 10,315 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans made from 2003-2004 in 20 cold weather U.S. states and in Canada because road salt may have corroded the fueling pipe. There are 9,389 vans recalled in the United States and 926 in Canada. The affected vans have "60/40" swing-out driver side doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM recalls 10,315 vans in cold-weather areas|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/14/gm-recall-idUSL2E8JE2BA20120814|publisher=Reuters|access-date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1500 discontinuation===
General Motors discontinued production of the 1/2-ton (&lt;8,500 lbs. GVWR) 1500 series vans in June 2014 (2015MY). Sources cite low production numbers and [[Corporate average fuel economy|CAFE]] requirements for the halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Login |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/15/chevy-express-1500-gmc-savana-1500-vans-discontinued/ |title=Chevy Express 1500, GMC Savana 1500 get the axe |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2014-07-15 |access-date=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the end of the 1500 model, unique features such as the all wheel drive and driver's side passenger doors have been removed from the options list. The Chevrolet City Express compact cargo van, a [[Rebadging|badge-engineered]] [[Nissan NV200]], has taken the place of the 1500 van but was discontinued quickly after poor sales. At the same time, the [[General Motors 90%C2%B0 V6 engine|Vortec 4300]] engine was phased out of production. The full-sized van is still offered as the Chevrolet Express Cargo and the GMC Savana Cargo with a larger payload.

The '''Chevrolet Caprice ''' is a full-sized [[automobile]] produced by [[Chevrolet]] in North America for the 1965 to 1996 [[model year]]s. Full-size Chevrolet sales peaked in 1965 with over a million sold. It was the most popular American car in the sixties and early seventies, which, during its lifetime, included the [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]], [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]], and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]].

Introduced in mid-1965 as a luxury [[trim package]] for the Impala four-door hardtop, Chevrolet offered a full line of Caprice models for the 1966 and subsequent model years, including a "formal hardtop" coupe and an Estate station wagon. The 1971 to 1976 models are the largest Chevrolets ever built. The downsized 1977 and restyled 1991 models were awarded ''[[Motor Trend]]'' Car of the Year. Production ended in 1996.

From 2011 to 2017, the Caprice nameplate returned to North America as a full-size, [[rear wheel drive]] police vehicle, a [[captive import]] from Australia built by [[General Motors]]'s subsidiary [[Holden]]—the police vehicle is a [[badge engineered|rebadged]] version of the [[Holden Caprice (WM)|Holden WM/WN Caprice]].&lt;ref&gt;chevroletcapriceppv.com&lt;/ref&gt; The nameplate also had a civilian and police presence in the Middle East from 1999 to 2017, where the imported [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman/Caprice]] built by Holden was marketed as the Chevrolet Caprice in markets such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

== Early history ==
The Caprice name was coined by Bob Lund (Chevrolet's General Sales Manager) after a classy restaurant he frequented in [[New York City]]. Some say the car was named after Caprice Chapman, daughter of auto executive and influential Indy-car official James P. Chapman.

A ''Caprice Custom Sedan'' option package (RPO Z18) was offered on the 1965 [[Chevrolet Impala]] 4-door [[hardtop]],&lt;ref&gt;John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975, Revised 4th Edition, page 183&lt;/ref&gt; adding $200 to the $2,742 price tag. The Caprice option included a heavier frame, suspension changes, black accented front grille and rear trim panel with Caprice nameplate, slender body sill moldings, [[Fleur-de-lis]] roof quarter emblems, color-keyed bodyside stripes and Caprice hood and dash emblems. Full [[Hubcap|wheel covers]] were the same as that year's Super Sport, but the "SS" emblem in the center of the spinner was replaced by a Chevy bowtie. The Super Sport's blackout rear trim panel was also used, without the "Impala SS" nameplate. The interior featured a higher-grade cloth and vinyl seat and door trim (as well as thicker, higher-grade carpeting), faux walnut trim on the dashboard and door panels, pull straps on the doors and extra convenience lights. A full [[vinyl roof]] was optional. A {{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 engine was standard.

The Caprice was intended to compete with the [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]], [[Plymouth Fury|Plymouth VIP]], AMC's [[AMC Ambassador|Ambassador DPL]], and even the smaller [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4SUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=Caprice+LTD+VIP+DPL |page=79 |title=The 1966 cars |journal=Popular Science |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |date=October 1965 |volume=187 |issue=4 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models included luxuriously upholstered interiors with simulated wood dashboard and door-panel trim, thicker carpeting, sound insulation, courtesy lighting, and more upscale exterior trims.

Caprice gained series status for the 1966 model year and was positioned as the top-line full-size Chevrolet.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; It included a four-door [[hardtop]], six- or nine-passenger station wagon, and a two-door hardtop with a squared-off formal roofline in contrast to the Impala/SS Sport Coupe's fastback roof styling. All four Caprice models were marketed as "Caprice Custom."

The Caprice Custom Estate, a new station wagon model with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior trim was the first Chevrolet with such a design since its real woodie wagon was offered in 1954. All wagons included an all-vinyl upholstered two-row bench seat interior with an optional third rear-facing seat for two. The {{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}  [[V8 engine]] was standard for Caprice models with the {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "Turbo Jet" V8 optional. It was possible to have Regular Production Option (RPO) L72, a 425-hp big block V8 with solid lifters, special camshaft and carburetor, and 11 to 1 compression. An [[automatic transmission]], [[power steering]], white sidewall tires and a vinyl top (on the hardtops) were extra-cost options, but most were built with them. Additionally, [[air conditioning]], [[power windows]], Cruise-Master speed control, [[power seat]]s, an [[automatic headlight dimmer]] (1965 only) and [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] radios were available.

The 1966 Caprice featured a revised grille and front bumper, and new rectangular taillights which replaced the Chevrolet-traditional triple round taillights used on Impalas since 1958, with the exception of the 1959 model. Lenses and silver trim on Caprices differed slightly from the other full-sized models. Sedans and coupe models included luxurious cloth and vinyl bench seats with a folding center armrest in the rear seat. Optional on both was a "Strato bench" seat which combined bucket-style seat backs and center armrest with a bench cushion for six-passenger seating. Caprices had unique standard wheel covers, although some of the optional wheels and wheel covers on full-sized models were optional.

New options included the "Comfortron" air conditioning system where the driver could set a constant year-round temperature. A "Tilt/Telescopic" steering wheel option could be adjusted vertically in six positions, as well as be telescoped further out from the steering column. Coupes could also be ordered with an all-vinyl interior featuring Strato bucket seats and center console with floor shifter, storage compartment, courtesy lighting and full instrumentation at the front end of the console that was integrated with the lower instrument panel.

The 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]], and the [[Lada Riva]].

=== 1967–1968 ===
[[File:1967 Chevrolet Caprice coupé 283, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chevrolet Caprice Custom Coupe]]

The 1967 Caprice received a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, as well as a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillamp lenses were all red as the backup lamps were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps in the center of the taillamps. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional {{convert|425|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the {{convert|385|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the {{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s was now optional with the {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.

The "100 millionth GM car" was a light blue metallic 1967 Caprice coupe.&lt;ref name=100mil&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.manufacturing.net/automotive/blog/13193193/today-in-manufacturing-history-gm-celebrates-100-millionth-car-made-in-us | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200308020952/https://www.manufacturing.net/automotive/blog/13193193/today-in-manufacturing-history-gm-celebrates-100-millionth-car-made-in-us | archivedate = 2020-03-08 | title = Today In Manufacturing History: GM Celebrates 100 Millionth Car Made In U.S. | date = 2016-04-21 | first = Mike | last = Hockett | work = Manufacturing.net | publisher = Industrial Media, LLC. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assembled on April 21, 1967 at the Janesville, Wisconsin plant. It was actually the 100 millionth GM car built in the United States; production including Canadian plants had actually passed the 100 million mark in March 1966, with an [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] being the car in question.&lt;ref name=100mil/&gt;

[[File:1968 Chevrolet Caprice Estate Wagon.JPG|thumb|left|1968 Chevrolet Caprice Estate Wagon]]
The 1968 Caprice received a minor facelift that included a new grille with [[taillight]]s set into the bumper and optional [[hidden headlamps]]. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, and the removal of vent (wing) windows. Side marker lamps became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lamps which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got front side marker lamps on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its cubic inch displacement listed on half the bezel; the lamp itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. The Caprice Coupe got serious competition when Chevrolet offered the car's formal roofline in the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] series as well. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|425|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new {{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Fire V8 rated at {{convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} replaced the {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lamps. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.

=== 1969–1970 ===
[[File:Flickr - Hugo90 - 1969 Chevrolet Caprice 427.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Chevrolet Caprice coupe (427)]]

The 1969 Caprice and other full-sized Chevrolets were restyled with new body lines and front bumpers that wrapped around the grille (again with optional concealed headlamps, for which washers could be added as a new "one year only" option) along with ventless front windows on all models. The {{convert|119|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase, inner bodyshell and framework were carried over from the 1965 model. The station wagon was renamed the Kingswood Estate and continued to use exterior wood grain trim along with  the interior trim of the Caprice sedans and coupes. Front seat headrests were now standard equipment to meet federal safety standards and the ignition switch moved from the dashboard to the steering column and also locked the steering wheel when the key was removed. This was part of a Federal mandate for the 1970 models, but introduced a year earlier on all General Motors cars except the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]].

The 1969 Caprice also offered a new GM-designed variable-ratio power steering unit as optional equipment along with a seldom-ordered "Liquid Tire Chain" option, which was a vacuum activated button that would spray ice melt on the rear tires (UPC option code is "V75"). The standard engine was enlarged to a {{convert|235|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with optional engine choices including a new {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Fire V8 in 255 or {{convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} versions, a {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8, as well as a {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8s rated at {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. All V8 engines were now available with the three-speed [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission for the first time though the two-speed Powerglide was still offered with the 327 and 350 V8s.

[[File:1970 Chevrolet Kingswood Estate.jpg|thumb|right|1970 Chevrolet Caprice Kingswood Estate]]

The 1970 Caprice received a minor facelift featuring a more conventional under the grille bumper replacing the wrap-around unit used in 1969, along with new triple vertical taillamps in the rear bumper. Power front disc brakes and fiberglass-belted tires on {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels were made standard equipment along with a {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8. Optional V8s included a {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 350 and a new {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Fire V8. The top engine was a new {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Jet V8 offered in {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} or {{convert|390|hp|abbr=on|0}} versions. Both the 250- and {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Turbo Fire engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the {{convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} 350 Turbo Fire and both 454 Turbo Jet engines required premium fuel. A three-speed manual transmission with column shift was standard equipment as in previous years but the floor-mounted four-speed manual with Hurst shifter was dropped from the option list for 1970 as were the Strato bucket seats and center console previously offered on coupes. Automatic transmission options included the two-speed Powerglide on 350 V8s and Turbo Hydra-Matic with all engines.

=== 1971–1972 ===
For 1971 the top-of-the-line Caprice was completely redesigned on a longer {{convert|121.5|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase and featured bold, Chrysler-like fuselage styling. Flush exterior door handles and double-shell roofs were new on the Caprice – both features first appearing on the 1970½ Camaro and Pontiac Firebird. The new styling was highlighted by a Cadillac-like "egg-crate" grille with a "Caprice" emblem in the center and brushed metal trim surrounding the taillights on the rear deck. The "Full-Perimeter" frame and all-coil suspension were refined for improvements in ride and noise reduction.

[[File:CAPR005.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Caprice Hardtop Coupe]]

Inside were revised interiors featuring a two-spoke cushioned steering wheel and new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer and instrument placement similar to previous full-sized Chevrolets. Caprices continued with higher grade interiors than their Impala counterparts with luxurious cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, wood grain trim on dash, steering wheel and door panels plus carpeting on lower door panels on both sedans and coupes. A center front seat armrest was also featured on sedans.

Station wagons now used a unique {{convert|125|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase and were larger than ever before. Station wagons continued to use unique model names. The Kingswood Estate wagon was considered to be equivalent to the Chevrolet Caprice being the top level wagon. Unlike previous years, station wagons used unique rear suspension using a solid axle with leaf springs as opposed to coil springs and trailing arms on sedans and coupes.

Wagons featured a [[Station wagon#Tailgate evolution|'clamshell' design]] marketed as the ''Glide-away'' tailgate, also called a "disappearing" tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor.  The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35&amp;nbsp;lb push to fully lower the gate.  Raising the manual gate required a 5&amp;nbsp;lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate.&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The '71 Wagons, Big Changes Coming Up |journal=Popular Science |date=October 1970 |pages=74–75 |first=Jan P. |last=Norbye |first2=Jim |last2=Dunne |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22glide+away%22+tailgate#v=onepage&amp;q=%22glide%20away%22%20tailgate&amp;f=false |accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years.  Wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat &amp;mdash; and could accommodate a 4 x 8' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded.  The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door &amp;mdash; for example, in a closed garage.

The Kingswood Estate had the {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel engine as standard with the same engine options as the coupes and sedans. Station wagon models came only with single exhaust systems which meant lesser power ratings than coupes and sedans.

Power front disc brakes were standard equipment, along with a larger {{convert|255|hp|kW|abbr=on}} gross ({{convert|170|hp|0|abbr=on}} net) 400 cubic-inch Turbo Fire [[V8 engine|V8]]. This engine, along with all optional power plants, were designed to run on regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline of 91 research octane or higher. To achieve this, all engines had the compression ratios lowered to 8.5:1. General Motors was the first of the big three to have all engines run on regular fuel and these changes were made to help meet the increasingly stringent emission regulations that were to come into place in years to come.

Optional engines included 300 horsepower (206 net) 402 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8 (marketed as "Turbo Jet 400 on full-size cars, and as "Turbo Jet 396 on intermediate cars) and {{convert|365|hp|kW|abbr=on}} gross ({{convert|285|hp|kW|abbr=on}} net) 454 Turbo Jet V8 which came standard with dual exhaust. When equipped with dual exhaust, the 400 Turbo jet was rated at {{convert|260|hp|abbr=on|0}}. At year's beginning, a three-speed manual transmission was standard when the model was introduced in the fall of 1970, although at mid-year, the Turbo Hydramatic transmission and variable-ratio power steering became standard equipment on all Caprice models and lower-line models fitted with a V8 engine.

Chevrolet specifications included both "gross" and "net" horsepower figures in 1971, which was a year before the industry wide transition to [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net horsepower]] figures. SAE net horsepower standardized horsepower ratings in accord with SAE standard J1349 figures to get a more accurate horsepower figure. "Net" horsepower was measured "as installed" in a vehicle with power using accessories and emission equipment installed, exhaust systems, and air cleaners, leading to lower power ratings. For 1971, the 400 Turbo-Jet engine was rated at 300 gross horsepower with and without dual exhaust, while the more accurate net figures show it rated at {{convert|206|hp|abbr=on}} with single exhaust and 260 with dual exhaust. Beginning in 1972, automakers would follow SAE standard J1349 and the "net" horsepower ratings were the only advertised ratings.

In its May 1971 issue, ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine published a comparison road test that included a Caprice Coupe and a Cadillac Sedan de Ville. The tested Caprice was powered by the 454 V8 and loaded with virtually all available options. Though testers noted that the Cadillac had a higher level of quality than the Chevrolet along with a far more luxurious interior (the DeVille was upholstered in leather while the Caprice had the standard cloth trim), the magazine ultimately considered the Chevy as the better value at $5,550 compared to the Cadillac's $9,081 price mainly due to the fact the $3,500 price difference bought only a modest quality addition and a few more luxury features.

[[File:1973 Chevrolet Caprice.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Caprice Hardtop coupe]]

The 1972 Caprice received a facelift with a revised grille that was lower in height than the '71 model flanked by a new bumper with increased protection one year ahead of the Federal mandate. This was done by a bumper within bumper design. Heavy gauge beams reinforced the bumper which are attached to the frame. The rear bumper also featured this design and now had the triple taillights now mounted in the bumper. Engine offerings were carried over from 1971 with the switch to "net" horsepower ratings including {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the standard two-barrel {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Fire V8, {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with optional dual exhaust) for the four-barrel Turbo Jet 400 big-block V8 and {{convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the four-barrel dual exhaust {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Turbo Jet V8 (rated at {{convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in wagons with single exhaust). Turbo Hydramatic transmission, variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes continued as standard equipment. New to the Caprice lineup was a pillared four-door sedan. All models also featured a revised "Astro Ventilation" system utilizing vents in the [[doorjamb]]s that replaced the troublesome 1971 version that used vents in the trunklid and turned out to be a major source of complaints to Chevy (and other GM divisions) dealers from customers. 6-way power seats, 8-track tape players, and air conditioning were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1972-Chevrolet-Full-Size-Brochure-Cdn/1972-Chevrolet-Full-Size-Cdn--18-19 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816085218/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1972-Chevrolet-Full-Size-Brochure-Cdn/1972-Chevrolet-Full-Size-Cdn--18-19 |archivedate=2016-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1973–1974 ===
[[File:1973 Chevrolet Caprice Convertible, front right (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg|thumb|right|1973 Caprice Classic convertible]]

The Caprice models were renamed to Caprice Classic for the 1973 model year. The [[Chevrolet Kingswood|Kingswood Estate]] model with simulated wood-grain body side trim was now named the Caprice Estate. The [[convertible]] was moved from the Impala to the Caprice lineup for the first time in 1973.

The 1973 facelift included a new cross-hatch grille, {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} energy absorbing front bumper and revised square taillights, again mounted in the bumper. New emission standards added EGR ([[exhaust gas recirculation]]) valves to engines (with a new roller camshaft), and horsepower ratings were reduced. The standard Turbo-Fire {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} two-barrel was now rated at {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while the only optional engine was the Turbo-Jet {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 produced {{convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with dual exhaust {{convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with single exhaust used in station wagons). A new option on sedans and coupes was a 50/50 bench seat with recliner on the passenger side.  The instrument panel and steering wheel was now offered in a variety of colors to better harmonize the interior, and the wheel featured a new "soft grip" rim.  Front seats were also re-positioned to give more legroom for taller drivers, but shorter people found the driving position awkward.

The 1974 models featured a new formal, upright grille while turn signals moved from the bumper and were now inset of the dual head lights. The taillights were moved above the new {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} rear bumper. New thick "B" pillars and fixed rear quarter opera windows were new on two-door coupes, which essentially eliminated pillar-less hardtop design much like the GM intermediates did the previous year. Other body styles including the four-door pillared and hardtop sedans, convertible and Estate Wagon were carried over with only minor changes from 1973. New to the engine roster was a four-barrel version of the small block 400 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8 rated at {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (which was the standard engine on wagons and all cars sold in California, optional on other models in 49 states). All other engines were carried over from 1973 although the 454 Turbo Jet lost {{convert|10|hp}}, now rated at {{convert|235|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Also new for 1974 were integrated lap and shoulder seat belts and an "interlock" system required the driver and front seat passengers to fasten seat belts to be able to start the engine. The interlock feature proved so unpopular that Congress rescinded it shortly after the introduction of the 1975 models. A new option this year was a remote control for the passenger-side outside [[rear-view mirror]].  Instrument panels and steering wheels offered

=== 1975–1976 ===
[[File:'75 Chevrolet Caprice Classic Convertible (Auto classique).jpg|thumb|right|1975 Chevrolet Caprice Classic convertible]]

The 1975 models received an all new front end with swept back head lights, revised grille and turn signals return to the bumper which also angles backward at both ends. New tail lights now wrap around rear fenders. Caprice Classic Sport sedans now feature opera windows in the D-pillars. The dashboard, radio and climate control graphics were revised; the speedometer read up to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour. The Caprice convertible would be discontinued after the 1975 model year along with its full-size B-body counterparts including the [[Oldsmobile Delta 88]], [[Buick LeSabre]], and [[Pontiac Grand Ville]]. Just about 8,350 Caprice Classic convertibles found buyers in 1975.

As fuel economy became a bigger priority among Americans following the Arab Oil Embargo of late 1973 and early 1974, Chevy made the smaller {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} small block V8 with two-barrel carburetor standard on all Caprice models except wagons for 1975. In California, the four-barrel {{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 350 V8 was the base engine and this engine was unavailable elsewhere. Optional engines included the {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} small block V8 (standard on wagons) and {{convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} big block, the last was not available in California. All engines except for the 454 were single exhaust systems with the introduction of the catalytic converter. Station wagons that used the 454 now featured dual exhaust as well. Also introduced this year were GM's "High Energy" electronic ignition and radial tires that were advertised as part of "Chevrolet's New Efficiency System." The theme of economy continued through to the new options this year: A new "Econominder" gauge package included a temperature gauge and a "fuel econominder", the second being a gauge alerting drivers as to when their driving habits caused the engine to use more or less fuel. Also new on the options list: intermittent windshield wipers, and 50/50 seating options on the Impala coupe/sedan and Caprice Classic convertible models.

[[File:1976 Chevrolet Caprice Classic.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Caprice Classic 4 Door Hardtop]]

"Landau" model was also introduced in 1975, and was primarily an appearance package. Carried over unchanged into 1976, the Landau featured a choice of special paint colors, sports-styled dual remote outside rear-view mirrors, color-keyed wheel covers, a [[landau]] [[vinyl roof]] (with chrome band across the roof), a vinyl bodyside molding insert, and pinstriping. Inside there were color-keyed seat belts and floor mats. Fender and dashboard emblems rounded out the package. With minor changes, the Landau would be carried over into the 1977-era coupe models.

The 1976 Caprice Classic marked the sixth and final year of a body style introduced for the 1971 model year. 1976 models weighed approximately {{convert|4314|lb}} and was {{convert|222.9|in|mm}} long, growing considerably from the 1971s {{convert|4040|lb}} and {{convert|216.8|in|mm|adj=on}} length. Only minor changes were made for 1976, including an eggcrate grille similar to that of the 1976 [[Cadillac Calais]]/[[Cadillac DeVille|DeVille]]/[[Cadillac Fleetwood|Fleetwood]] flanked by new rectangular headlights, along with revised exterior and interior trimmings. Engine options remained virtually unchanged with the 350 two-barrel remained standard in everywhere but California where the 350 four-barrel was standard. The only change was the 350 four-barrel was available in sedans and coupes nationwide and rated at {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The dual exhaust equipped 454 increased {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}}, rated at {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and was still unavailable in California. Also available was the {{convert|180|hp}} four-barrel 400 V8 standard on wagons and optional on all other models. This was the final year for the big block 454 V8 to be offered, along with hardtop body styles and the clam shell-tailgate design for the station wagon.  The 1976 4-door hardtop Sport Sedan was the last pillarless model offered by Chevrolet; it was offered in both the Caprice Classic and Impala series. All subsequent Caprice passenger cars were pillared sedans and coupes.

[[File:'77 Chevrolet Caprice Sedan (Auto classique Ste-Rose '11).JPG|thumb|left|1977 Chevrolet Caprice sedan]]
The 1977 Caprice Classic was drastically [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]], which reduced its weight and exterior dimensions, while increasing headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space compared to 1976 models. GM called its downsizing program '''Project 77''' and invested $600 million to develop the most changed full-size Chevrolet to date.&lt;ref name="Std Catalog Chev"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chappell|title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet, 1912-1990|date=1990|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0873411412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight reductions from the 1976 models were {{convert|611|lb|abbr=on}} for coupes, {{convert|637|lb|abbr=on}} for sedans and {{convert|871|lb|abbr=on}} for wagons. The 1977 Caprice coupe and sedan were over {{convert|10|in|mm}} shorter while the wagon was {{convert|14|in|mm}} shorter. Wheelbases were reduced to {{convert|116|in|mm}} from {{convert|121.5|in|mm}} for coupes and sedans and {{convert|125|in|mm}} for wagons. Width was reduced by {{convert|4|in|mm}} for sedans and coupes; the wagon's width remained virtually unchanged. Heights were increased by {{convert|2.5|in|mm}} and trunk capacities were increased to {{convert|20.9|cuft|m3}} for sedans and {{convert|19.8|cuft|m3}} for coupes.

Although by modern standards the 1977 ''downsized'' Chevrolet cars are quite large, the new Chevrolet had exterior dimensions closer to the intermediates of its day. In fact the 1977 Caprice shared the same {{convert|116|in|adj=on}} wheelbase of the intermediate sized Chevrolet Chevelle, and 1977 marked the first year in history that a midsized car, the Monte Carlo, was larger than a full sized car; this would be repeated in the 1980s by GM and [[Chrysler]] on multiple vehicles, then by [[Nissan]] in the early 2000s when the third generation [[Nissan Altima]] was bigger than the concurrent fifth generation [[Nissan Maxima]]. The introduction of such a small full-size car was considered quite a risk for General Motors. To help ensure the car was a success, preview clinics were held by Chevrolet which returned very positive results. Furthermore, the design process for this car was revolutionized.

Ford would respond with advertising the [[Ford LTD (North America)#1975–1978|Ford LTD]] traditional full-size attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1977 Ford Ad|url=http://www.oldcaradvertising.com/Ford/1977/1977%20Ford%20Ad-01.html|website=Old Car Advertisements|publisher=Ford Motor Division|accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Ford released a true downsized full-size car with the introduction of the 1979 [[Ford LTD (North America)#1979–1982|Ford LTD]]. Chrysler responded in 1979 when it re-engineered its intermediate B-body cars, and designated them the full-size [[Chrysler R platform|R-bodies]]. However, these were not true downsized cars like GM and Ford introduced. 1977 models included a four-door sedan, two-door sedan, six-passenger two-seat station wagon and an eight-passenger three-seat station wagon. All models had window framed doors. No hardtop models were offered.

[[File:1978-Chevrolet---Caprice.jpg|thumb|left|Rear Window used on 1977–79 Caprice coupe (1978 model shown)]]

Two-door models featured a unique rear window that created a semi-fastback. This glass had sharp corners giving it three sides. This was done through "hot-wire" bending process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Litwin|first1=Matthew|title=Aero War II|journal=Hemmings Motor News|date=July 2007|url=http://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hmn/2007/07/Aero-War-II/1484993.html|accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caprice was available as either the "Sport Coupe" or as the "Landau Coupe". The Landau Coupe features a partially covered vinyl roof.

Station wagon models received a new three-way tailgate for 1977; the clamshell tailgate was gone. The three-seat models featured a rear-facing third seat for two occupants making these cars eight-passenger models. The cargo capacity was reduced to {{convert|87|cuft|L}}, and although the station wagon could still carry a {{convert|4|x|8|ft|abbr=on}} sheet of plywood, this could now only be done with the tailgate down. The station wagons use the coil spring suspension in the rear, as for the sedans and coupes.

The headlight dimmer switch was also removed from the floor and incorporated into the turn signal lever for all 1977 models. All 1977 models were named Caprice Classics. A V8 engine was no longer standard equipment for the first time since 1965. The base engine for 1977 Chevrolet Caprice coupes and sedans was Chevy's long-running [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|250&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in]] (4.1&amp;nbsp;L) [[Straight-6|six-cylinder powerplant]] rated at {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine was last available in a full-size Chevy in 1973 in the lower-line Bel Air. Standard on station wagons and optional on other Caprice models was a {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version of the Chevy's small-block V8. This was the first year the 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in had been used in a full-size Chevrolet; it was first introduced in 1976 in compact and mid-sized Chevrolet lines. A {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with four-barrel carburetor was now the top engine offering as the larger {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were discontinued.  Standard for all models was the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission.

With the new lighter weight and smaller engines, Chevrolet promised increase fuel economy without great loss of performance compared to 1976 models. The EPA estimates for 1977 Chevrolet was {{convert|17|mpgus}} city and {{convert|22|mpgus}} highway for six-cylinder models. Ford's 1977 LTD was rated at {{convert|15|mpgus}} city and {{convert|19|mpgus}} highway with its smallest engine, the {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. By the same EPA estimates, Plymouth's Gran Fury returned 13 MPG city and 18 MPG highway with the 318 V8. Performance was good when comparing the smaller 1977 Caprice to the 1976 Caprice. A 1976 350 two-bbl powered Chevrolet ran 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph in 12.9&amp;nbsp;seconds, while a 400 powered model ran 10.7 seconds. 1977 models ran 11.4&amp;nbsp;seconds to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} with the 305 engine and 10.8 seconds with the 350 engine. ''Car and Driver'' tested a 1977 Chevrolet Impala with the 350 engine and 3.08:1 axle running a 9.6&amp;nbsp;second 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph time and obtaining a {{convert|117|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed. The 350 was available with a 2.56:1 axle ratio and a 3.08 axle ratio which may explain the difference in performance times.

The 1977 models became the number one selling car in the United States. (In 1976, the previous generation full-size Chevrolet was the third best seller). More than 660,000 full-size Chevrolets were produced for the 1977 model year, with the most popular model being the four-door Caprice Classic sedan (212,840 produced). By 1978 more than 1 million downsized Chevrolets had been produced. Auto publications agreed with the public reception, with ''[[Motor Trend]]'' awarding the 1977 Chevrolet Caprice [[Car of the Year]].

''[[Car and Driver]]'' declared "Even the most jaded car critics are in fact tripping over each other trying to be the first to anoint this sedan to be the best full-sized Chevrolet ever made." ''Car and Driver'' commented on the F41 suspension option which included stiffer springs, larger sway bars, wheels, and tires to say, "It will make you think your Chevy came from the Black Forest instead of Detroit."

1978 models had minor front and rear styling revisions. The engine line-up remained unchanged, but numerically lower axle ratios were used in an attempt to boost fuel economy. The 305 and 350 engines went from a standard 2.56:1 axle in 1977 (2.73:1 for wagons), to a 2.41:1 axle in 1978 (2.56:1 for wagons). An optional 3.08 axle was also available for 350 powered Caprices. The 305 V8 engine received an aluminum intake manifold which reduced engine weight by 35&amp;nbsp;pounds. A larger brake booster was also added to help reduce braking effort. New options included a steel sliding moonroof and 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio.

The 1979 models continued with only minor refinements. Again the front and rear styling was refreshed slightly. The 250 six gained five horsepower, while the 305 V8 lost {{convert|15|hp}}. The change to the 305 was a result of switching from the larger Rochester 2GC carburetor to the smaller Rochester Dualjet carburetor. The 350 engine was unchanged.

=== 1980–1985 ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
The 1980 Caprice Classic saw its first major revision since the 1977 downsizing. To further improve the fuel economy of the car, efforts were made to reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. The Caprice received all new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics the hood was tapered lower, while the trunk area was higher. The grille was now an egg crate style while the tail-light panel featured three separate square lights per side. All the doors and components within were redesigned to be lighter, including the window crank mechanisms, which now used a tape drive mechanism. Greater use of aluminum including in-bumper reinforcement and in-sedan/coupe radiators helped to further reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. 1980 models were approximately {{convert|100|lb}} lighter than 1979 models.

The new styling increased the trunk capacity of both coupes and sedans to {{convert|20.9|cuft|m3}}. This increase was also partially achieved with a now-standard compact spare tire on a {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} wheel. A new frame lift jack replaced the bumper mounted model. A larger {{convert|25|usgal}} fuel tank was standard equipment in sedans and coupes. Easy-roll radial tires, improved anti-corrosion measures, low friction ball joints and larger front suspension bushings were also new for 1980. Puncture-sealant tires and cornering lights were new options.

The {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} six, was replaced by a new 90 degree [[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#3.8L (229 CID)|Chevrolet 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (229&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in)]] [[V6 engine|V6]] as the base engine for sedans and coupes. This engine shared the same bore and stroke as the 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8. California emission cars used the [[Buick]] [[Buick V6#231|3.8&amp;nbsp;L]] (231&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in) V6 engine. The Chevrolet 3.8&amp;nbsp;L was rated at {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} while the Buick V6 engine had a {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} rating. Although the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 had the same horsepower rating as the 250 six used in 1979, the 250 had {{convert|25|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} more torque than the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (200&amp;nbsp;lb·ft vs 175&amp;nbsp;lb·ft). The 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 did boost Chevrolet Caprice's fuel economy to an EPA estimated {{convert|20|mpgus}} city and {{convert|29|mpgus}} highway, the highest a full-size Chevrolet had been rated to date.

The base V8 engine was new for 1980. The [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#267|4.4&amp;nbsp;L 267&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in]] V8 rated at {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and was the standard engine for station wagons. This engine had a Rochester Dualjet carburetor, and was not available in California. The 2-barrel carburetor on the {{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced with a four-barrel increasing the 305's output to {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}}. This was now the most powerful engine option (standard on California station wagons), as the {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was no longer available, except as part of the police package option. The Oldsmobile-built [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine#LF9|350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in Diesel V8]] was added to the option list for station wagons. This engine was rated at {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|205|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. To further increase fuel economy, all transmissions were equipped with an electronically controlled lock-up torque converter clutch.

[[File:Chevrolet-Caprice-Classic-coupe.jpg|thumb|1981–1985 Caprice Classic Landau coupe]]

1981 models saw only minor revisions. Styling was unchanged other than the grille which remained egg crate style but now had larger sections. Refinements included redesigned front disc brakes for less drag and a translucent plastic master cylinder reservoir. The cruise control became equipped with a resume feature, while wire wheel covers had locking bolts to secure them in place. This was the last year for the Delco GM 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio option.

The engine line-up remained unchanged, although the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L 229&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V6 was now rated at {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8 was rated at {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. All engines were updated with the ''Computer Command Control'' (CCC) system which included an electronically metered carburetor. This change occurred in 1980 for California emission cars and did not occur to Canadian emission cars until 1987. The Oldsmobile-built [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine#LF9|350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in Diesel V8]] was added to the option list for the coupe and sedan models during the model year.

1982 models saw only minor styling revisions. The model line-up was reduced by one, with the Caprice Landau coupe dropped. Remaining were the sedan, sport coupe, six-passenger wagon and the eight-passenger wagon.  A new four-speed automatic overdrive transmission with lock-up torque converter joined the powertrain line-up. This transmission helped boost highway fuel economy, while improving city performance with a 3.08:1 rear axle ratio. The overdrive transmission was only available with the 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8, and was a mandatory option for this engine.

The engine line-up and power ratings remained unchanged. The [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine#LF9|350 cubic-inch Diesel V8]] engine was now available on all models.

1983 was marked with the fewest models to date. No two-door models were produced, leaving only the four-door and the eight-passenger station wagon, since the 6-passenger wagon also left the line-up. The 4.4&amp;nbsp;L 267&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in engine was discontinued, but all other engines remained unchanged. The 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in engine and the automatic overdrive transmission was standard on station wagons. The 350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in diesel was available with the automatic overdrive transmission at extra cost, while the 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8 came equipped only with the automatic overdrive transmission. The 1983 Chevrolet Caprice Classic was selected on the ''Car and Driver'' [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best]] list.

The 1984 model year saw the return of the two-door sport coupe making a three model line-up. Styling remained unchanged. 1984 models were virtually identical to 1981 models. The windshield washer controls were moved from the dashboard to the turn signal stalk to create the ''multi-stalk''. The optional cruise control (which continued to be mounted on the turn signal stalk) now featured acceleration/deceleration in {{convert|1|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} increments. An optional Landau package included a vinyl roof, sport mirrors and reveal moldings.

Powertrain availability and power ratings were unchanged for 1984. The 350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in diesel engine came standard with an automatic overdrive transmission when equipped in station wagons.

1983 saw the introduction of a Caprice clone from Canada, the [[Pontiac Parisienne]]. While this car bore Pontiac emblems and trim similar to the pre-1982 Bonneville, it was a Caprice in every other way. Pontiac dealers gained a full-size car again and buyers did not seem to mind that the car was virtually the same as the contemporary Caprice. It sold well enough to remain available until 1986 for the sedan and 1989 for the Safari station wagon.

[[File:Chevrolet Caprice wagon -- 04-10-2011 rear.jpg|thumb|right|Caprice Estate wagon]]

1985 models received minor updates while styling remained unchanged. The interior was updated for 1985, marking its most significant update since 1977. The simulated woodgrain appliqué used on the dash was replaced with a simulated silver metallic appliqué. The shaft-style radio was replaced with a more modern [[ISO 7736|DIN-and-a-half]] style radio, while the pull-out headlight switch was replaced by a push button style switch. The climate controls were updated with rotary switches for the fan and rear window defroster replacing the toggle style switches. The instruments were updated to have a more modern appearance, with a horizontal speedometer while a round speedometer was included with the optional gauge package.

The engine line-up saw major changes for 1985. The [[Chevrolet 90-Degree V6 engine#4.3L (262 CID)|4.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine (262&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in)]] with throttle body fuel injection (RPO LB4) replaced both 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6s in 1985 as the base engine for sedans and coupes. The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L engine was rated at {{convert|130|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, producing {{convert|20|hp|abbr=on}} more than the 229&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V6. The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 shared its bore and stroke with the 350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in Chevrolet V8. This engine came standard with a three-speed automatic but was available with the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. The 5.0&amp;nbsp;L 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8 engine received an electronic spark control and compression was increased from 8.6:1 to 9.5:1. This caused the 305's output to jump to {{convert|165|hp|abbr=on}}. The 350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in diesel engine remained unchanged, as it was dropped in January.

=== 1986–1990 ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}

1986 marked the first major exterior restyle since 1980.  From 1986 to 1990, the Caprice was the only sedan riding on the B platform; all other sedans had been discontinued or transferred to the smaller, front-wheel-drive [[GM H platform (1986)|H platform]]. The front fascia was restyled to have a more aerodynamic look: the Caprice emblem was no longer a standup hood ornament, but was an emblem located on the vertical area directly above the grill in the center of the front fascia. A smaller grille with prominent vertical chrome divider bars replaced the larger previous egg-crate grille. The redesigned front end still had two side-by-side rectangular [[Parabolic aluminized reflector#Automotive_headlamps|sealed beam]] headlamps, as had been used on the Caprice since 1976; the taillights were restyled, but continued to have three chambers—another long-running Caprice styling cue. New aerodynamic side-view mirrors were used. The car's sheetmetal remained otherwise unchanged.

The former [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] was rebranded as "Caprice" (without "Classic" appended), unifying all full-size Chevrolets under a single model name for the first time since the early 1930s. Still available was a Caprice Classic four-door sedan, coupe and eight-passenger station wagon, while a new Brougham four-door sedan joined the model line-up. Brougham models featured a 55/45 front seat with armrest, and a new "pillow design" with velour fabrics. Broughams featured woodgrain appliqué on its dash fascia, a dome map light, front-door courtesy lights and 20&amp;nbsp;oz carpeting. Power window controls for all models moved from the door panel to the armrest for improved ergonomics.

The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine received a {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} boost, rated at {{convert|140|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in engine was unchanged and remained standard on station wagons. Station wagons built after approximately 1 November 1985 came equipped with the [[Oldsmobile]]-built [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|307&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in]] engine and the 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in was no longer available in station wagons. This engine was used in all GM [[B-body]] station wagons from this point on to simplify production. The 307 was equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and was rated at {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|255|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in diesel engine was discontinued.

[[File:87-90 Chevrolet Caprice wagon.jpg|thumb|1987-90 Caprice Estate wagon]]

The 1987 models received minor styling revisions: composite aerodynamic [[headlamp]]s replaced the former sealed beams, and a standup hood ornament returned. A simulated woodgrain dashboard finish, last used on the 1984 models, returned.{{CN|date=February 2020}} The model range was slightly revised, and now included a base level Caprice eight-passenger wagon and a Caprice Classic Brougham LS four-door sedan. The Brougham LS featured all the Brougham amenities plus a padded vinyl roof, opera lights, and LS monograms. Leather upholstery was a new available option for Brougham and Brougham LS sedans, which also had a new pillow-style seating design and a folding center armrest in the back seat. Exterior colors for the Brougham LS were now limited to conservative colors compared to the 1986 model: White, Black, Burgundy, Dark Blue and Dark Grey. The trim level names "stacked up": Caprice, Caprice Classic, Caprice Classic Brougham, and Caprice Classic Brougham LS in ascending order of price and plushness.

The engine offerings received only minor changes. The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 and the 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8 were updated with roller lifters and center bolt valve covers. The 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in had a {{convert|5|hp|abbr=on}} rating increase and was now rated at {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|250|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 307&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in Oldsmobile-built V8 remained unchanged and was the only available engine for the station wagons. Some Canadian-sold Chevrolet Caprice sedans used the 307&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in Oldsmobile-built V8 in place of the Chevrolet-built 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in engine during the 1987 model year.

The 1988 model range was revised, with the sport coupe dropped due to low sales. There was now just one station wagon model, an eight-passenger configuration. Engines remained unchanged, and the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission was standard equipment. Other standard equipment for all models included tinted glass, a remote-control driver's side view mirror, automatic headlight on/off, and an AM/FM stereo. A police version of the Caprice wagon was made; it had the code 1A2 and was designed for special service use.

1989 marked the first year of a fuel-injected V8 engine. The 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8 was updated with throttle body electronic fuel-injection (RPO LO3), first introduced in 1987 on Chevrolet/GMC pickups and vans. This engine was rated at {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|255|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, which was only a slight increase in torque over the carbureted engine. However, as a result of fuel injection, the cold weather starts, drivability, fuel economy and emissions were all improved. The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 was no longer the base engine, and was now only available in taxi and police optioned Caprices. The 307 engine remained unchanged for station wagons. Rear-seat passengers received shoulder belts for the outboard positions and air conditioning was standard on all models.

1990 was essentially a carryover year and marked the last year for this body style. New for 1990 were door-mounted front [[seat belt]]s, quick-connect fuel lines for the 305&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in engine, revised interior colors, new metallic paint color choices, and [[Scotchgard]]-protected interior fabrics. The model range and engine offerings were unchanged. The 1990 Caprice was only produced until the end of 1989,{{fact|date=December 2019}} when production was shut down to prepare for the redesigned 1991 models.

=== 9C1 Police model ===
[[File:Chevrolet Caprice MUC Police Car.jpg|thumb|right|Chevrolet Caprice (9C1)]]
A police package, orderable under GM's [[Regular Production Option]] code '''[[9C1 (Chevrolet Police package)|9C1]]''', was introduced for the new base-model Caprice that replaced the [[Chevrolet Impala#Sixth generation (1977–1985)|Impala]] for 1986. In the 1986 [[Michigan State Police]] tests, the Chevrolet Caprice was competitive with the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]], [[Dodge Diplomat]] and [[Plymouth Gran Fury]]. The Caprice had the fastest quarter-mile times of the three, and the best [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. The [[Dodge]] and [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] outran the Caprice in the 0–100&amp;nbsp;mph times, but placed last in the road course times. However, there was only a 1/3 second difference between the fastest and slowest vehicles on the road course. All four cars were very close in competition for 1986, and there was little performance difference.&lt;ref name="Chev Police"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanow|first1=Edwin|title=Chevrolet Police Cars|date=1997|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, WI|pages=146–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1987, the 9C1 Caprice changed little. The 350-4bbl engine received a boost in compression, roller lifters, and new center-bolt valve covers.&lt;ref name="1986 Caprice MVMA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chevrolet Motor Division|title=1987 Caprice MVMA Specifications|date=June 1986|publisher=General Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} rating of this engine helped boost the Caprice's performance above its competition.The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L engine remained available, but was marketed towards urban police departments with less need for performance.&lt;ref name="Chev Police" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1986 Caprice MVMA" /&gt; Michigan State Police tests had the Chevrolet Caprice beating its competition from Ford, Dodge, and Plymouth in almost every category. The Caprice had the quickest quarter-mile times and 0–100&amp;nbsp;mph times, the highest top speed, the fastest road course time, and the best fuel economy, though the Plymouth and Dodge had shorter braking distances.&lt;ref name="Chev Police" /&gt; The 1987 Chevrolet Caprice won the contract for the Michigan State police and would hold this contract until 1996 when the Caprice was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Police Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanow|first1=Edwin|title=Encyclopedia of American Police Cars|date=1999|publisher=Crestline Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1988, the 9C1 Caprice was again unchanged. Michigan State Police tests proved to be more competitive, with the Ford LTD Crown Victoria showing a strong improvement in performance. The Plymouth and Dodge models continued unchanged and were not competitive with the Chevrolet and Ford.&lt;ref name="Police Encyc" /&gt; 1988 tests showed the Caprice with the fastest quarter mile and 0–100&amp;nbsp;mph times, the best fuel economy, the fastest road course time (although it tied with the Ford) and the best ergonomics. The Ford edged out the Chevrolet with a {{convert|1|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} faster top speed and better brakes, but the Chevrolet scored second place for both those categories. Overall the Chevrolet scored the highest in the competition, followed by the Ford, Dodge and Plymouth&lt;ref name="Chev Police" /&gt;

For 1989, the 9C1 Caprice received some major changes to the drivetrain. All engines were now equipped with throttle-body [[fuel-injection]] (shared with the truck/van lineup and based on the LB4 4.3L TBI injection system first used with the 1985 model year passenger cars), and the {{convert|305|cuin|l|abbr=on}} engine (RPO LO3) was now added to the option list. The available engines were now the {{convert|4.3|l|cuin|abbr=on}} V6, the {{convert|305|cuin|l|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|cuin|l|abbr=on}} V8s (which was only available on police package models). The V6 and 350 engines were equipped with TH700-R4 transmissions while the 305 engine used the TH200-4R transmission. The V6 and the 305 used a 3.08:1 axle ratio, while the 350-powered cars now used a 3.42:1 axle ratio.&lt;ref name="89 9c1 Brochure"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chevrolet Motor Division|title=1989 Chevrolet Caprice 9C1|date=1988|publisher=General Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4.3&amp;nbsp;L remained at {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the 305 TBI engine was rated at {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and the 350 TBI engine was rated at {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="89 9c1 Brochure" /&gt; Unlike the LO5 used with the GMT400 light duty truck and van line including the R/V series, the police spec LO5 used the roller camshaft sourced from its TPI equipped F bodies and Corvette along with high flow fuel injectors. The 350 powered Caprice did well again at Michigan State Police tests for pursuit rated cars. It had the fastest 0–100&amp;nbsp;mph, the fastest road course time, the highest top speed and the best fuel economy. The Dodge Diplomat and Ford LTD Crown Victoria outbraked the Caprice, and the Plymouth Fury and Dodge Diplomat had better [[ergonomics]] than the Caprice.&lt;ref name="Chev Police" /&gt;

1990 was another carry-over year for the 9C1 Caprice with the only major change being door mounted seatbelts.&lt;ref name="1990 9C1 Brochure"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chevrolet Motor Division|title=1990 Chevrolet Caprice 9C1|publisher=General Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Michigan State Police tests, the only competition was from the [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria]], as production of the [[Dodge Diplomat]] and [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] had ended during 1989. The Caprice won all six categories for 1990, having the quickest 0–100 times, the fastest road course times, the best brakes, highest top speed, the best fuel economy and the best interior ergonomics. This was the first time any car had won all six categories in Michigan State Police tests.&lt;ref name="Chev Police" /&gt;

The 1991 model was completely restyled—It replaced the 1977-based rectilinear design with rounded, more [[aerodynamic]] sheetmetal. While the body and interior were all new, the chassis and powertrain were largely carried over from the 1990 model; the steel fuel tank was replaced by a HDPE tank (with capacity on sedans decreasing from {{convert|25|USgal|L}} to {{convert|23|USgal|L}}), and [[anti-lock brakes]] were added as standard equipment on all models.&lt;ref&gt;Sanow, Edwin J. ''Chevrolet Police Cars'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1997), p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; Several major components (including the floor pan) are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996. Much of the engine availability was carried over from the previous generation, which included for all models the 5.0 L [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L03|L03]] V8. A 5.7L[[Chevrolet small-block engine#L05|L05]] V8 was also carried over; it was originally only available on 1991 and 1992 9C1 Police package models, but finally made generally available to the general public on the 1993 Caprice LTZ.

''[[Motor Trend]]'' awarded the new Caprice Classic [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]. Two trim levels were initially offered—Caprice and Caprice Classic, replacing the previous Classic and Brougham models. [[General Motors]] had hoped to regain the top spot as America's favorite automobile with the new aerodynamic styling of their full-size offering.

[[File:1995 Chevrolet Caprice Classic sedan, front left side.jpg|thumb|left|1995 facelift Caprice]]

However, the final B-body Caprice was not well received by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a "beached whale"&lt;ref name="conceptcarz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z12088/Chevrolet-Caprice.aspx |title=Chevrolet Caprice |publisher=www.conceptcarz.com |author=Anonymous |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNMoney"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/04/28/225531/index.htm |title=GM: Time to Get in Gear |publisher=www.CNNMoney.com |author=Alex Taylor III |accessdate=2009-12-29 |date=1997-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being the removal of the skirted rear wheel wells in favor of more conventional, open wheel wells. This applied only to the [[sedan (car)|sedan]] model; station wagons retained the skirted wheel wells. A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan in the form of a restyled side window between the back door and C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had a so-called "[[Hofmeister kink]]", featuring 4 sides and sweeping towards the front, lacking the sharp corner pointed toward the rear), and the wagon was given the same mirrors as the sedan. In 1995 and 1996 the [[Chevrolet Impala#Seventh generation (Impala SS, 1994–1996)|Impala SS]] was exported to Middle Eastern markets [[Badge engineering|badged]] as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel and the badge on the dashboard saying ''Caprice SS''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In 1994 the Caprice received new engines, including an optional mildly detuned version of the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette's]] LT1 350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (5.7&amp;nbsp;L) engine that put out 260&amp;nbsp;hp (194&amp;nbsp;kW) and 330&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (447&amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque on 87 octane. The standard engine in all sedans, including 9C1 police cars, was the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}}, L99 263 (4.3&amp;nbsp;L) V8. The&amp;nbsp;LT1 was optional in the 9C1 police package and standard in the wagon.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The LT1&amp;nbsp;350 was standard in civilian sedans with the addition of the V92 towing package.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The V92 towing package also gave a heavy duty suspension with similar spring rates to the 9C1 police car suspension, 2.93 gears, V08 heavy duty cooling with a mechanical fan, heavy duty rear drum brakes and limited-slip differential.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The 1994 Caprice's interior had a redesign which featured a [[Chevrolet Camaro (fourth generation)|Camaro]] steering wheel, digital speedometer and a new console.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Caprice 9C1 with the LT1 engine became one of the quickest and most popular modern day police vehicles. This vehicle established such strong devotion by many [[police]] departments that a [[cottage industry]] thrived in refurbishing Caprices for continued police service after GM discontinued production of the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-11-06/news/9711060120_1_squad-cars-caprices-patrol-cars |work=Chicago Tribune |date=1997-11-06 |page=3 |first=Pat |last=Clawson |title=Police Keep Beloved Caprice and Save Money |quote=The trend to restore Caprices began in 1995 when Shaheen Chevrolet of Lansing, Mich., refurbished the first of 918 squad cars for law agencies nationwide.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chevrolet Caprice wagon.jpg|left|thumb|Caprice Classic wagon]]

The car's production was stopped in December of 1996 due to sales pressure from the mid-size [[Chevrolet Lumina]], financial troubles at [[General Motors]], and consumer demand shifting from full-sized family sedans to the increasingly popular [[sport utility vehicle]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The [[Arlington, Texas]] vehicle assembly plant (used for Caprices, [[Buick Roadmaster]], [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]], and [[Cadillac Fleetwood]]) was converted to produce GM's more profitable full size SUVs (the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]]). In 1997, the Lumina LTZ would take the Caprice's place as Chevrolet's premium passenger car. Total production of 1991–96 models was 689,257 with production ending on December 13, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Chevrolet Impala]] nameplate was reintroduced to the American passenger car market in 2000 as the marque's premium offering, albeit in a [[front wheel drive]] configuration.

{{Main|Holden Caprice}}

General Motors revived the Chevrolet Caprice nameplate in the Middle East and Latin/South American markets on imported [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman and Caprice]] models built by its Australian subsidiary [[Holden]]. The [[Holden WH Caprice|WH]] series Statesman/Caprice was the first series to be engineered to support both left- and right-hand drive (Middle Eastern market being [[left-hand drive|LHD]] while Australia [[right-hand drive]]) in order to allow for manufacturing of export versions. Same was true for the related short-wheelbase [[Holden VT Commodore]], whose left-hand drive version became the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] in the Middle East (In Mexico only, the Commodore and Holden models were sold alongside the Lumina and Caprice).

The Middle Eastern Caprice came out in 2000 in four versions, base LS, standard mid-range LTZ, a sporty SS and the range topper Royale (introduced in 2002). Differences between the models were mostly equipment and slight styling tweaks. The base LS came with a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine; the LTZ came standard with a {{convert|295|hp|kW|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} 5.7&amp;nbsp;L ''Gen III'' V8, the SS and Royale came with a {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} version of the same engine. In 2003, Holden launched a revised and facelifted Statesman and Caprice, which was reflected in their Middle Eastern versions for the 2004 model year. The new models sported new front and rear fascias and completely redesigned interior. Engines carried over unchanged.

In 1999, GM again considered resurrecting the Caprice name in America for 2000, this time under this generation, and as a new Caprice 9C1 long before the appearance of the sixth generation model (third generation Holden Caprice) as the Caprice PPV, but it did return several years later as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/true-blue-nypd-20100823-13g6n.html|title=True blue NYPD|publisher=drive.com.au|date=|accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
In November 2006, a completely redesigned Caprice lineup was launched, again based on the recently introduced [[Holden Caprice (WM)|Holden WM Statesman/Caprice]]. The new Caprice lineup includes the base LS, LTZ, SS and Royale, all sporting the new {{convert|360|hp|kW|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} ''[[GM LS engine#L98|L98]]'' 6.0&amp;nbsp;L V8.

The LS, LTZ, and Royale all share the front bumper as the Holden WM Statesman while the LS lacks the Statesman's trademark foglights which are seen on the LTZ and Royale; the SS gains the Caprice's front bumper and foglamps minus the parking sensors. The LS also gains the [[Holden Commodore (VE)|VE Commodore]] Omega's interior and rims, while the LTZ gains the rims from the VE Commodore V based on the Commodore Omega, and the Statesman's interior minus the headrests with the LCD screens and DVD player, while the Royale gains the Statesman's rims, and the Statesman's interior with the LCD screens in the head rests and DVD player from the Holden versions, the grille from the [[Holden Caprice|Daewoo Veritas]], hood ornament similar to the one that the appears on the 4th and 5th generation models, and the SS gains the same rims as the WM Caprice, interior from the Caprice minus the headrests with the LCD screens and DVD player, color coded version of the grille's trim, and the optional lip spoiler from the WM Caprice.

The Caprice was updated for 2011 to include the features that Holden included the Holden Caprice. The Caprice lettering engraved on the chrome trim which was on the car from 2000 until 2010 on the trim was dropped &amp; replaced by a Caprice nameplate badge which is below the chrome trim on the left end of the rear fascia on the trunk. The V6 engines were dropped in the LS &amp; LTZ leaving the V8 as the standard engine while the LS got the rims that were previously on the LTZ from 2007-2010 as well as previously seen on the VE Commodore V based on the Omega Series I model, while the LTZ &amp; Royale get the rims seen on the VE Commodore Calais V Series II &amp; the 2010-2011 [[Chevrolet Omega|Chevrolet Omega Fittipaldi Edition]] and the SS now gains the rims that the WM Caprice V Series II has. The LS, LTZ, &amp; Royale still retain the Statesman front bumper, while the SS still retains the Caprice/Caprice V front bumper. The Royale also gains a rear vision camera in the chrome trim on the trunk which is absent on the LS, LTZ, &amp; SS like the Holden Caprice &amp; Caprice V. For the 2013 model year for the Caprice SS the Impala badge on the trunk was dropped in favor of the traditional Chevrolet bowtie.

The Caprice was updated again based on the [[Holden Caprice (WM)|Holden WN Caprice]]. The Caprice LS &amp; LTZ still retain the front bumper as the WM Statesman while the Royale now gets the same front bumper as seen on the WM/WN Caprice &amp; the Caprice SS &amp; the rims that were previously on the 2011-2013 Caprice SS, the 2010-2013 WM Caprice V, &amp; currently the WN Caprice LPG model, and the [[Holden Commodore (VF)]] Calais's interior just like the Holden models. The SS now gains the rear vision camera which was previously only available on the Caprice Royale while it is still not available on the Caprice LS or LTZ, the same interior updates the WN Caprice &amp; Caprice Royale, and also gets the same rims as on the WN Caprice V &amp; while the LS, LTZ &amp; SS gain new rims.

The Holden-sourced Chevrolet Caprice in the LS trim is used in Middle East police forces in the [[Saudi Arabia]],  [[United Arab Emirates]] such as the [[Abu Dhabi Police]], [[Royal Oman Police]] and [[Dubai Police Force]]. In 2012 after the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] ended the Abu Dhabi Police donated 100 of its Caprice LS police cars to Libya along with uniforms making it the only country in the continent of [[Africa]] to have the Holden sourced Caprices in service.

On October 5, 2009, General Motors announced the Chevrolet Caprice [[Police vehicles in the United States and Canada|Police Patrol Vehicle (PPV)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wert |first=Ray |date=2009-10-05 |url=http://jalopnik.com/5373645/exclusive-the-chevy-caprice-police-car-is-back |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Chevy Caprice Police Car Is Back! |work=[[Jalopnik]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chevrolet Caprice is sold only to law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and was not available to the Canadian market as of 2011. General Motors will not directly sell a Caprice PPV to the general public, however, some vehicles have been purchased by individuals via dealer sales channels. These included GM and dealer demonstrator vehicles, excess unsold dealer inventory, and purchases for demonstration use by law enforcement upfitters and other related businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcaprice.com |title=New Caprice |publisher=New Caprice |date=|accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caprice PPV is imported from Australia and is a [[captive import]] of the [[Holden Caprice]] from the [[Holden Caprice (WM)|WM range]], not the short-wheelbase [[Holden Commodore]] from the [[Holden Commodore (VE)|VE Range]], which is a main patrol car in Australia. However, these cars both share the Zeta platform.&lt;ref name="Official: Holden to export Commodore as US police car"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=2009-10-05 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/4DB981DD3B661FE0CA25764600253D2B |title=Official: Holden to export Commodore as US police car |work=GoAuto |publisher=John Mellor |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caprice comes with the 6.0&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM LS engine#L77|L77]]'' [[Active Fuel Management|AFM]] V8, which was standard in 2011 and has been optional since 2012; or the standard 3.6&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LLT|LLT]]'' [[Gasoline direct injection|SIDI]] V6 engine, which became available nine months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dowling |first=Joshua |date=2009-10-05 |url=http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2009/large-passenger/holden/caprice/holden-unveils-police-caprice-16924 |title=Holden unveils Police Caprice |work=CarPoint |accessdate=2009-10-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008112312/http://carpoint.com.au/news/2009/large-passenger/holden/caprice/holden-unveils-police-caprice-16924 |archivedate=2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmfleet.com/pdf/2012_Police_Specifications_Manual.pdf |title=2012 GM police specifications |accessdate=2011-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131112807/http://www.gmfleet.com/pdf/2012_Police_Specifications_Manual.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both engines are [[E85]] ethanol-capable.&lt;ref name="Official: Holden to export Commodore as US police car"/&gt;

The Caprice PPV concept car was based on the Middle Eastern spec Caprice LS, which was based on the Holden WM Caprice Series I. The front end and grille are the same as the 2007-2010 Caprice LS. The Caprice letter is engraved into the chrome trim on the trunk, there is PPV lettering on the right side of the rear fascia and a FlexFuel nameplate, which was on GM vehicles in North America from 2007 through 2009. The PPV has dual exhaust, a floor shifter in the console, a prisoner partition with rifle and shotgun mounts, lights and siren controls in the console, 18 inch steel rims &amp; center caps from the Impala 9C1, and a touch screen in place of the radio and HVAC controls. A prototype similar to the concept car in LAPD was shown around Australia by Holden. Another prototype tested by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] had the same front end, grille, steel rims and center caps as the production models, while the car was based on the Series I WM Caprice with its rear bumper, colored turn signal indicators lamps on the side of the car, chrome trim with Caprice engraved on it, &amp; V8 badge from the 2007-2010 Caprice.

Special features are added by Chevrolet for the Caprice Police Patrol Vehicle (PPV). The driver's seat has a special indentation made to accommodate a police officer's equipment belt so it makes it more comfortable to drive. Special tuning such as Performance Algorithm Liftfoot (PAL) calibration and a performance-tuned suspension was added for increased performance meant specifically for police needs.

Previously, the future of Holden's North American export program had been the subject of contradictory announcements as General Motors emerged from [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|bankruptcy]]. On July 11, 2009, [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] declared the Commodore-based Pontiac G8 "too good to waste" and indicated it would return as a Chevrolet Caprice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tingwall |first1=Eric |last2=Zenela |first2=David |date=2009-07-11 |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/bob_lutz_pontiac_g8_chevrolet_caprice/index.html |title=Bob Lutz: Pontiac G8 will live on as a Chevrolet Caprice |work=[[Automobile Magazine]] |publisher=Source Interlink Media |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Welch |first=David |date=2009-07-10 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jul2009/db20090710_847893.htm |title=GM May Revive Its Popular Pontiac G8 |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |accessdate=2009-07-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715020336/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jul2009/db20090710_847893.htm |archivedate=2009-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was undisclosed as to whether the revived Caprice was to be based on the short-wheelbase Holden Commodore (like the Pontiac G8) or the extended length Holden Caprice, like the Middle Eastern Chevrolet Caprice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nunez |first=Alex |date=2009-07-11 |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/07/11/lutz-pontiac-g8-to-continue-as-chevy-caprice-in-u-s-z28-likel/ |title=BREAKING: Lutz says Pontiac G8 to survive as Chevy Caprice in U.S.; Camaro Z28 reportedly dead |work=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]] |publisher=[[Weblogs, Inc.]] |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, Lutz retracted his comment, citing market conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2009/07/it_seemed_like_a_good_idea_at_the_time….html |title=It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time… |author=Bob Lutz |work=GM FastLane Blog |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2009-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720072540/http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/archives/2009/07/it_seemed_like_a_good_idea_at_the_time%E2%80%A6.html |archivedate=2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while GM CEO [[Frederick Henderson]] confirmed that police applications were being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lassa |first=Todd |date=2009-07-17 |url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/gm_ceo_fritz_henderson_interview/hummer_saturn_pontiac_g8.html |title=A Short Drive with GM CEO Fritz Henderson |work=[[Motor Trend]] |publisher=Source Interlink Media |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caprice police car has had a positive reception, placing perfect scores in an assessment by The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, with the only criticism being directed at over-cautious electronic stability control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barry Park |url=http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/holden-beats-ford-in-copcar-shootout-20110517-1eqox.html |title=Holden Caprice based police pursuit cop car |publisher=News.drive.com.au |accessdate=2013-12-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227101403/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/holden-beats-ford-in-copcar-shootout-20110517-1eqox.html |archivedate=2013-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What also makes the Caprice PPV different from its Australian &amp; Middle Eastern counterparts the lower end of the front bumper is based on the Commodore Omega Series II's front end, honey comb grille similar to the 2001-2011 [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]], and the interior is also from the Commodore Omega which was the common trim of VE Commodore to be used by law enforcement in Australia and New Zealand from 2007-2013. The detective version used the same interior that the Middle Eastern spec Caprice LS had from 2007-2013.

Updates to the Caprice PPV for 2014 include the interior from the [[Holden VF Commodore|Commodore Evoke]] with a [[Gear stick|column shifter]] to make room for equipment replacing the floor shifter that was in the 2011-2013 models, a full mounting plate for equipment, &amp; the 9C3 unmarked/detective version being discontinued. Updates to the Caprice PPV for 2015 now has the car gaining the same rear vision camera as the civilian WN, Royale, &amp; SS models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/08/2015-chevy-caprice-ppv-gets-rear-vision-camera-color-changes//|title=2015 Chevy Caprice PPV Gets Rear Vision Camera, Color Changes|publisher=gmauthority.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its Australian &amp; Middle Eastern counterparts, production of the Caprice PPV ended in 2017 at the Elizabeth plant after Holden ended manufacturing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/08/bad-news-from-oz-no-more-holden-caprice-after-2017/|title=Bad News From Oz: No More Holden Caprice After 2017|publisher=gmauthority.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General Motors]] used the '''Chevrolet Classic''' nameplate for the following vehicles:
* The second generation [[Chevrolet Corsa#Corsa B .281993.E2.80.932000.29|Chevrolet Corsa]], produced in [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] from 2002 to 2016
* The fifth generation [[Chevrolet Malibu#Fifth generation .281997.E2.80.932003.29|Chevrolet Malibu]], produced in the [[United States]] from 2004 to 2005 for use by fleets and [[car rental]] companies.
* The sixth generation [[Chevrolet Malibu#Sixth generation .282004.E2.80.932008.29|Chevrolet Malibu]], produced in the [[United States]] for 2008 for use by fleets and [[car rental]] companies.
* The seventh generation [[Chevrolet Malibu#Seventh generation .282008.E2.80.932012.29|Chevrolet Malibu]], to be produced in the [[United States]] for 2013 for use by fleets and [[car rental]] companies. GM shelved plans for the seventh generation [[Malibu Classic]] where the company decided to commence production of the eighth generation - the ninth generation Impala introduced in the 2006 model year took the place of the Chevrolet Classic as the [[Impala Limited]]. {{CN|date=December 2018}}
Notably, the latter two Chevrolet Classics are the past generation versions of the Malibu that are continued to be produced for fleet sales, as the current generations are sold though retail.

The '''Chevrolet Yeoman''' was a [[station wagon]] produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1958 model year. The Yeoman was available in two models, a two-door and a four-door, both with six-passenger [[seating capacity]]. Based on the [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]] passenger car series, the Yeoman represented the entry-level selections in the 1958 Chevrolet station wagon lineup, which also included the [[Chevrolet Brookwood|Brookwood]] and the [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]].

==Design==
For 1958, Chevrolet models were redesigned longer, lower, and heavier than their 1957 predecessors. The first ever production Chevrolet big block V8, the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#348|{{convert|348|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}]], was now an option. 
Chevrolet's design for the year fared better than its other [[General Motors|GM]] offerings, and lacked the overabundance of chrome found on Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs. Complementing Chevrolet's front design was a broad grille and quad headlights that helped simulate a 'Baby Cadillac'; the wagon's tail received a fan-shaped alcove on both side panels, similar to the sedan's, but wagon's housed single tail lights instead of dual (triple on Impala) to accommodate the tailgate.

Despite being a recession year, sales increased and overtook Ford, which held the top position in 1957) and the Bel Air the most popular Chevrolet model. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle became as the premium four-door Chevrolet [[station wagon]], rather than the two-door designs of the 1955-57 Nomads. Most Chevrolet station wagon models had two tail lights housed in abbreviated alcoves, which were made smaller to accommodate the rear gate. A new dash was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1958%20Chevrolet%20Guide-04.html |title=Directory 1958 Chevrolet Owners Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of a drag coefficient for 1958 Chevy wagons is estimated by a-c, is Cd = 0.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automobile-catalog.com/make/chevrolet_usa/full-size_chevrolet_5gen/full-size_del_ray_wagon/1958.html |title=1958 Chevrolet (USA) Yeoman Wagon full range specs |publisher=Automobile-catalog.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Delray-based Yeoman was the lowest version and featured minimal interior and exterior trim and limited options.

==Safety==

The Yeoman featured Chevrolet's new "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these "x-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons/1958%20Chevrolet%20Wagons-06-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1958-chevrolet.htm |title=1958 Chevrolet One-Fifty |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-08-19 |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 187,000 1958 Chevrolet wagons built, only 16,590&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldride.com/library/1958_chevrolet_brookwood.html |title=1958 Chevrolet Brookwood |publisher=Oldride.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of these were 2-door model Yeoman (not counting Delray Sedan Delivery), Chevrolet’s entry-level wagon. 

The Yeoman was dropped (along with the Delray) at the end of 1958. For 1959, Chevrolet's Brookwood would now offer a 2-door wagon and become the lowest priced station wagon.

Chevrolet's two other wagon lines, the mid-range Brookwood and top-trimmed Nomad were available only as 4-door wagons for 1958.

      <text bytes="6105" xml:space="preserve">The '''Chevrolet Parkwood''' was a [[station wagon]] built by [[Chevrolet]] from 1959 to 1961. As the station wagon equivalent of the [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] passenger car series, it represented the middle member of the Chevrolet station wagon lineup of those years, above the lowest-priced [[Chevrolet Brookwood|Brookwood]] models, but below the luxury-leader [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]].

All 1959 and 1960 Parkwoods were six-passenger models, whereas the [[Chevrolet Kingswood|Kingswood]] (Chevrolet's other Bel Air equivalent during those two years), had seating for nine. The Parkwood became available in both passenger configurations for 1961, when the Kingswood name was dropped. (The latter name returned for 1969.) The Parkwood name was also dropped for 1962, when all Chevrolet station wagons began sharing series names with their passenger-car linemates. Throughout its three-year production run, the Parkwood was available with either a six-cylinder or [[V8 engine]].

For 1961, Chevrolet again had a totally new body, not just new sheetmetal. Its wheelbase remained {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on}}, but its length was now reduced slightly to {{convert|209.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}.
All engines options of the previous year remained in effect with the standard engines being the 235.5 CID Six of {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or the 283 CID V8 of {{convert|170|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The V8 cost $110 more than the Six and weighed {{convert|5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} less. GM discontinued the Chevrolet Parkwood name for 1962, instead naming their station wagons after their series names: [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]], [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]].

===Safety===
Chevrolet's 1961 Parkwood (as well as all other full size Chevrolets) featured a shortened version of Chevrolet's "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame introduced in '58. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these "x-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons/1958%20Chevrolet%20Wagons-06-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965. &lt;ref&gt;http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1958-chevrolet.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chevrolet Parkwood Discontinuation and Replacement===
GM discontinued the Chevrolet Parkwood wagon nameplate (as well as the Brookwood and Nomad wagon names) for 1962, instead naming their station wagons after their series names: [[Chevrolet Biscayne|Biscayne]] (replacing Brookwood directly), [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]]. The 1962-'64 Biscayne, Bel Air, and Impala wagons were very similar to Chevy's 1961 wagon models.

The '''Chevrolet Lumina APV''' is a [[minivan]] that was produced by the [[Chevrolet]] division of [[General Motors]].  The first front-wheel drive minivan sold by Chevrolet, the Lumina APV was sold in a single generation from the 1990 to 1996 model years. Marketed alongside the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] and [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]], the Lumina APV competed against the Dodge Grand Caravan/Plymouth Grand Voyager, the extended-length Ford Aerostar, and the Mazda MPV.

Introduced a year before the [[Chrysler minivans (AS)|second-generation Chrysler minivans]], the Lumina APV was the first American-market minivan to adopt the form factor of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager.  Though manufactured on a model-specific chassis, the Lumina APV was front-wheel drive, deriving its powertrain from GM sedans.  In terms of size, the Lumina APV was slotted between the [[Chevrolet Astro]] and full-size [[Chevrolet van|Chevrolet Van]].

During its production, the Lumina APV and its Pontiac and Oldsmobile counterparts were assembled at the [[North Tarrytown Assembly]] facility, becoming the final vehicles produced there prior to its closure.  For 1997, Chevrolet adopted a distinct nameplate for its front-wheel drive minivan, replacing the Lumina APV with the [[Chevrolet Venture]].   

== Background ==
In response to the [[Chrysler minivans (S)|first-generation Chrysler minivans]], General Motors introduced the rear-wheel drive [[Chevrolet Astro]] (and GMC Safari) for the 1985 model year.  Sized closely to the short-wheelbase Chevrolet Van, the Astro was marketed in both passenger and cargo van configurations.  In 1986, GM unveiled the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] concept vehicle, largely serving as a preview of the APV model lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/was-this-gm-minivan-the-greatest-letdown-in-automotive-1665847028|title=Was This GM Minivan The Greatest Letdown In Automotive History?|last=Orlove|first=Raphael|website=Jalopnik|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While far more radical in body design, the Trans Sport concept was the first minivan to adopt the front-wheel drive form factor used by the Chrysler minivans.  

In contrast to the Astro/Safari, which used a variety of components from Chevrolet/GMC light trucks, the front-wheel drive GMT199 platform was dedicated to the Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Oldsmobile minivans, sharing primarily engines and transmissions with other GM vehicles.  In place of the official GMT199 platform designation, GM began to use the APV name, standing for All Purpose Vehicle.  Chevrolet would receive a Lumina APV, with Oldsmobile receiving the Silhouette; Pontiac adopted the Trans Sport name from the 1986 concept van.   

During its development, the APV model lines largely benchmarked the extended-length Chrysler vans, closely matching their length, width, and height (on a shorter wheelbase).  To expand its market potential (and to mitigate any potential model overlap), GM sought distinct marketing objectives for each model line.  The Lumina APV was to compete with the higher-volume Voyager/Caravan directly, serving as a "volume leader"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MotorWeek|title=1990 GM APV's {{!}} Retro Review|date=2018-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg4St9cJuHg|access-date=2019-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Trans Sport was to be the minivan equivalent of sporty Pontiac sedans, and the luxury-trim Silhouette was intended as a more contemporary competitor to the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] and Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer.

== Model overview ==
At the time of its 1990 release, the Lumina APV was marketed as a bodystyle of the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] model line.  For the 1989 model year, Chevrolet introduced the Lumina, effectively consolidating the Celebrity and Monte Carlo into a single model line, with the Lumina APV replacing the Celebrity station wagon.  

At its 1990 introduction, the Lumina APV was offered in two trim levels; a base trim and an up-level CL trim.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://consumerguide.com/used/1990-96-chevrolet-lumina-apvminivan/|title=1990-96 Chevrolet Lumina APV/Minivan|date=2014-06-19|website=Consumer Guide Auto|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Base-trim versions featured chrome exterior trim while CL versions were produced with red exterior trim and badging (similar to the Lumina Euro).  For 1993, the CL trim was renamed LS;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the Lumina APV badging was removed from the doors.  For 1994, the model underwent a mid-cycle revision and was renamed the Chevrolet Lumina Minivan (in place of the APV suffix).

=== Chassis specification ===
The Chevrolet Lumina APV is a GM [[GM U platform|U-body vehicle]], using the GMT199 platform designation. In contrast to the unibody design used by the Astro/Safari and the Van/Vandura, the Lumina APV chassis uses a chassis design similar to the [[Pontiac Fiero]] and [[Saturn S series|Saturn SL]], with a galvanized steel spaceframe supporting exterior body panels. The Lumina APV has a 109.8 inch wheelbase, sized between the Lumina sedan/coupe and the Astro/Safari.

In line with the Chrysler minivans, the Lumina APV was fitted with independent front suspension with MacPherson struts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimatespecs.com/car-specs/Chevrolet/4771/Chevrolet-Lumina-APV-31i.html|title=Chevrolet Lumina APV 3.1i Specs (1990 - 1992) - Technical Specifications for Years 1990, 1991, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=David Ruelas|title=1990 Chevrolet Lumina APV Salesman Training|date=2017-10-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS5fRgKd1T4|access-date=2019-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear beam axle was fitted with coil springs&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (the only other minivan besides the Ford Aerostar and Renault Espace at the time). As an option, Chevrolet offered the Lumina APV with load-leveling rear air springs,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; utilizing the air compressor that inflated the rear air springs for auxiliary use with an air hose kit.  The front brakes were vented discs, with drum brakes at the rear;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; anti-lock braking (ABS) was introduced for 1992. During 1994, traction control was introduced as an option (with the 3.8L V6).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Powertrain ====
Upon its 1990 release, the Lumina APV was powered by a 3.1L V6, producing 120&amp;nbsp;hp; a 3-speed automatic was the sole transmission offering. For 1992, a {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 3.8L V6 became an option, introduced with a 4-speed automatic.  For 1996, both engines were replaced by a 180&amp;nbsp;hp 3.4L V6; the 3-speed automatic was discontinued.

=== Body design ===

==== Exterior ====
Distinguished by its large windshield and sloped hoodline, the Lumina APV was of a "one-box" design, a configuration similar to the [[Ford Aerostar]] and [[Renault Espace]]. In line with the Aerostar and Chrysler minivans, the Lumina APV was configured with a single sliding door and a rear liftgate. Closely matching the 1987-1990 Chrysler "Grand" minivans in length, width, and height, the Lumina APV is nearly {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=out}} lower than the Astro and {{convert|3|in|mm|sigfig=1|abbr=out}} narrower. For 1993, the Lumina APV (and its counterparts) introduced a power-operated sliding door,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the first American-market minivan to offer the design.

Coinciding with the use of a galvanized steel spaceframe (in place of a conventional unit-body design), the Lumina APV was fitted with [[Sheet moulding compound|composite plastic (SMC)]] body panels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Developed for the [[Pontiac Fiero]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=MotorWeek|title=1990 GM APV's {{!}} Retro Review|date=2018-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg4St9cJuHg|access-date=2019-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later expanded in use for the [[Saturn S series|Saturn SL]], the manufacturing technique largely eliminated the threat of corrosion and damage from minor dents and dings. The manufacturing also allowed GM to style the Lumina APV separately from its Pontiac and Oldsmobile counterparts at low cost; each model line is externally distinguished by its hood and front fascia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Along from its front fascia, the Lumina APV is distinguished from its Pontiac and Oldsmobile counterparts in the styling of its roof. From the B-pillar to the windshield, the roof was painted black; on examples with tinted glass, the design was to retain the style of the glass roof of the 1986 Trans Sport concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jalopnik.com/was-this-gm-minivan-the-greatest-letdown-in-automotive-1665847028|title=Was This GM Minivan The Greatest Letdown In Automotive History?|last=Orlove|first=Raphael|date=2 December 2014|work=Jalopnik|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trans Sport had its entire roof painted black (with the exception of a band joining the B-pillars) while the Silhouette had body-color A-pillars and black B-pillars. Two-tone versions of the Lumina APV were available; an early configuration featured a blacked-out upper body. For 1992, Chevrolet standardized the folding sideview mirrors of the CL trim.

For the 1994 model year, the Lumina APV underwent an exterior revision, shortening the front overhang by nearly three inches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Largely intended to visually shorten the angle of the hoodline, the Lumina Minivan (dropping the APV suffix) was given a new hood, larger grille, and much larger headlights (shared with the [[Pontiac Bonneville#Ninth generation (1992–1999)|Pontiac Bonneville SSEi]]). 15-inch wheels became standard, with the LS offering a (restyled) version of the 16-inch wheels of the Beretta Z26. The roof was restyled slightly, adopting painted A-pillars and a full-length body-color roof.

For 1995, a [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)|center high-mount stop lamp (CHMSL)]] was added to the liftgate. As GM fitted the taillamps in the D-pillars, the CHMSL was the lowest-mounted of the three brake lamps.

==== Interior ====
Distinguished from its counterparts by trim,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the interior design of the Lumina APV was centered around its modular rear seating system.  Four configurations were offered: a two-seat cargo van, a five-seat passenger layout (2+3), six seats (2+2+2), and seven seats (2+3+2).  In contrast to removable rear bench seats (a design derived from full-size vans), the 34-pound rear seats of the Lumina APV were individually removable and each seatback folded flat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To supplement the cupholders of the interior, each seatback was fitted with two built-in cupholders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As part of the 1994 revision, 7-passenger versions were offered with the option of integrated child seats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For 1996, the five and six-passenger configurations were deleted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While sharing most of its dashboard design with the Trans Sport/Silhouette, the Lumina APV featured its own instrument panel design (derived from the [[Chevrolet Corsica|Corsica]]).  As a consequence of its sloped windshield design, the depth of the dashboard of the Lumina APV (and its counterparts) was among the highest ever seen in a mass-produced automobile.  For 1991, the dashboard padding was revised was revised to address complaints about glare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For 1992, the external radio antenna was replaced by an integrated design mounted between the headliner and the roof.  The 1994 revision brought an update to the instrument panel, lower dashboard (and center console controls), and introduced a driver-side airbag&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (replacing the steering wheel of the Lumina Z34 with one from the Camaro).{{Clear}}

From 1990 to 1996, Chevrolet produced the Lumina APV as a [[Cargo Van|cargo van]], known simply as APV (no Lumina badging was used on the exterior).  Slotted below the Astro/Safari, the cargo van competed against the Grand Caravan C/V.  While sharing an identical body with its passenger-van counterpart, Chevrolet deleted the rear interior of the cargo van to include a rubber-mat floor; the rear glass windows were replaced by body-color plastic panels bonded in place.

Of the three GMT199/APV vans, only Chevrolet offered a cargo van configuration.

=== Chinese clone ===
Chevrolet marketed the Lumina APV in China from 1993 to 1996, selling a number of examples in the country.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinacarhistory.com/2017/12/27/the-nusheng-jb6500-is-a-chevrolet-lumina-apv-copy-with-a-chrysler-engine/|title=The Nushen JB6500 Is A Chinese Chevrolet Lumina APV Copy With A Chrysler Engine|last=Feijter|first=Author Tycho de|date=2017-12-27|website=ChinaCarHistory|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Jiangsu Nushen Automobile (Nushen) debuted the Nushen JB6500.  While nearly identical in dimensions and exterior design, the JB6500 is a rear-wheel drive vehicle, powered by an 87&amp;nbsp;hp Chrysler-designed 2.2&amp;nbsp;L inline-four, paired to a 5-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2001, Nushen ended production of the JB6500.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Beretta''' is a [[front-wheel-drive]] two-door [[coupé]] produced by [[Chevrolet]] from 1987 to 1996. The Beretta was designed in the same design studio as the [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] and the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]], Chevrolet Exterior Studio 3, and was built at the [[Wilmington Assembly|Wilmington, Delaware]], and [[Linden Assembly|Linden, New Jersey]] assembly plants with other [[GM L platform]] models, the [[Chevrolet Corsica]] which came shortly before the Beretta, and the [[Canada]]-only [[Pontiac Tempest]] four-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]s. The Beretta was produced in base, CL, GT, GTU, Indy, GTZ and Z26 models. A [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] was the [[pace car]] for the 1990 [[Indianapolis 500]], and GM initially announced a production convertible replica, but a coupe version was offered instead.

==Models and changes==
Base model Berettas were equipped with the same powertrain as the Chevrolet Cavalier, the 2.2 L OHV four-cylinder engine and the three-speed automatic transmission by default, or the 60-degree V6. A five-speed manual was available only by special order if paired with the 2.2 L OHV, however very few special orders ever took place, and the three-speed automatic was the default option.

[[File:'89 Beretta GT.jpg|thumb|left|1989 Chevrolet Beretta GT]]
The GT included a 125&amp;nbsp;hp 2.8-liter V6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beretta Debuts|url=http://www.beretta.net/model_info/1988.htm|accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which grew to a 3.1&amp;nbsp;L in 1990, and the Z51 suspension package with 15-inch styled steel wheels and Goodyear Eagle GT tires. Also included was a sport cloth interior and sport steering wheel. The GTU was available from 1988 until the 1990 model year. Beretta GTUs (with the FE7 suspension package) were shipped to Cars and Concepts where they were equipped with 16x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels, custom body kits, a rear spoiler, mirrors, custom trim, and decals. With the FE7 Chevrolet claimed the Beretta GTU would deliver 0.92&amp;nbsp;g on the skid pad, a claim that most magazines of the day failed to duplicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lost Cars of the 1980s – Chevrolet Beretta GTU |url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2013/11/25/lost-cars-of-the-1980s-chevrolet-beretta-gtu/ |website=www.hemmings.com |publisher=Hemmings |accessdate=25 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; GTUs were only available in black, red and white.

The GTZ, which replaced the GTU, took over as the high-performance version of the Beretta. It was produced from 1990 to 1993. It came standard with Oldsmobile's 2.3-L high output [[GM Quad-4 engine|Quad 4]] [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]], which produced 180&amp;nbsp;hp (134&amp;nbsp;kW) and 160&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (217&amp;nbsp;N·m) of torque. Also standard was a [[Getrag]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] and GM's FE7 performance suspension.

''Motor Trend'''s only complaint was the Quad 4's NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) and noted it was one of the most raucous engines of its time. Beginning in 1991, the 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 could be had as an option on the GTZ, but it was only available with a three-speed automatic transmission that increased the 0-to-60&amp;nbsp;mph time to around 9.0 seconds. The 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 was standard on 1990–1992 GT models and optional for all base models and GTs in 1992. Starting in the 1994 model year the 3.1&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]] could only be ordered with an [[automatic transmission]].

The 1991 model year saw major interior updates, including a new dashboard and center console and the addition of a driver's side airbag.

In 1994, the GT and GTZ were replaced by the Beretta Z26, which put it squarely between the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]] Z24 and Lumina Z34 in Chevrolet's lineup. The 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 was redesigned and became the 3100 V6 and gained 20&amp;nbsp;hp at 160. The new 3100 V6 was only available with a new four-speed automatic transmission. The Quad 4 HO lost a total of 10&amp;nbsp;hp (7&amp;nbsp;kW) in 1994, its last year of production. The 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Quad 4 was only available with a five-speed manual transmission. In 1995 the 3100 V6 lost 5&amp;nbsp;hp, down to {{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which also carried on to the 1996 model.

Beretta sales steadily declined every year of production as the market turned away from two-door models. In 1996, Chevrolet ended production of both the Beretta and Corsica after 10 model years. The Corsica was replaced  by the [[Chevrolet Malibu]] in 1997. The last Beretta rolled off the assembly line on July 30, 1996.

The '''Chevrolet Omega''' is an [[executive car]] sold by [[Chevrolet]] for the [[Brazil]]ian market.  Replacing the [[Chevrolet Opala]], which was a development of the [[Opel Rekord]] C, the original Chevrolet Omega was based on the [[Opel Omega]] A, and built locally between 1992 and 1998.  After 1999, local production ceased, and [[General Motors do Brasil]] imported [[Badge engineering|badge engineered]] versions of the [[Holden Commodore]] from Australia.

Based on the [[Opel Omega]] A, the Chevrolet Omega A debuted in [[Brazil]] in 1992 with a choice of two engines—a 2.0-liter four-cylinder (GLS and GL trim) and 3.0-liter six-cylinder (CD trim). From 1995, following the discontinuation of Omega A in Germany, the engines were upgraded to a 2.2-liter four (GLS) and a {{convert|4.1|L|cid|-1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|Chevrolet straight-six engine]] (CD) as used in the previous GM Opala albeit tuned by [[Lotus cars|Lotus]] and with electronic multiport fuel injection added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2010/02/25/chevrolet-omega-the-last-250/ Chevrolet Omega, the last 250 at Hemmings Blog: Classic and collectible cars and parts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carinfo.autold.com/car-chevrolet_omega-22-gls.html Chevrolet Omega 2.2 GLS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carinfo.autold.com/car-chevrolet_omega-41-cd.html Chevrolet Omega 4.1 CD specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[station wagon]] (called Omega Suprema) [[Car body style|body styles]] were available. The station wagon shared the exact powertrain configuration and trim options with the sedan versions. Some funeral parlor owners chose the Omega Suprema as the preferred car for hearse-based modifications.

In addition to the bigger engines, suited to local petrol quality, [[General Motors do Brasil]] had also deemed it necessary to beef up the suspension of the Omega to deal with Brazilian road conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://gerpisa.org/ancien-gerpisa/actes/25/25-3.pdf | title = Globalisation and assembler-supplier relations: Brazil and India | journal = Actes du GERPISA | location = São Paulo, Sussex | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = John | first2 = Mario | last2 = Salerno | page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CD version was offered the availability of the ''[[GM 4L30-E transmission|4L30-E]]'' automatic transmission as an option.

The Omega was re-released in September 2010.

The '''Chevrolet Nomad''' is a [[station wagon]] model produced by [[Chevrolet]] that was marketed from 1955 to 1961, from 1967 to 1972, and then used as a [[trim package]] on the 1976 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]] as well as for [[Chevrolet van]]s during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In [[South Africa]], the Nomad name was used on a small utility vehicle. 

The Nomad is best remembered in its two-door [[Tri-Five]] form that was considered a [[halo model]] during its three-year production. It was named for ''[[nomad]]s''.

==Pre production==
The two-door Nomad differed from other station wagons of the era by having unique styling more reminiscent of a hardtop sedan than that of a standard station wagon. Chevrolet shared this body with [[Pontiac]], which marketed its version as the [[Pontiac Safari]].

The Nomad's unique design had its roots in a [[Motorama|General Motors Motorama]] show car of the same name that was shared with the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette]], [[Pontiac Bonneville Special]], and the [[Oldsmobile F-88]]. The Concept was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1954 as one of Head Stylist [[Harley Earl]]'s "dream cars". It followed the introduction in 1950 of the [[Ford Country Squire#First generation (1950–1951)|Ford Country Squire]] two-door station wagon.

GM approved production of the vehicle if the design could be transferred to its standard model because top GM brass felt that they could sell more models if it were attached to the popular [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] model. Following the product debut in 1955, it was not uncommon for the car to be referred to as the Chevy "Bel Air Nomad".

*'''1955''' Chevrolets received all-new styling. Advertised as "The Hot One," the boxy new Chevy was crisp, clean, and thoroughly modern-looking, and its popularity was shared with the [[Tri-Five]] Chevrolets of this generation. Nomads, like Bel Airs, came loaded with interior carpet, chrome spears on front fenders, chrome window moldings, and full wheel covers. For 1955, Chevrolets gained a [[V8 engine]] option. The new [[Chevrolet small-block engine#265|{{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] featured a modern, [[overhead valve]], high compression, short [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] design that was so good that it remained in production in various forms for many decades. The base V8 had a two-barrel [[carburetor]] and was rated at {{convert|162|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and the "Power Pack" option featured a four-barrel carburetor and other upgrades yielding {{convert|180|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Later in the year, a "Super Power Pack" option added high-compression and a further {{convert|15|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It had room for six passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Brochure_1/1957%20Chevrolet%20Brochure-07.html |title=1957 Chevrolet brochure 1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1956''' Chevrolets received a face-lift. This gave Chevys a more conventional full-width grille, pleasing those customers who did not like the 1955 front end. Nomads now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheet metal as other Bel Airs, lacking the original's unique trim. A padded dashboard was now available. For 1956 Chevy hid the gas cap behind a flip-down tail light on the left side.
*'''1957''' V-8 engine displacement grew to [[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] from 265 in 1957, with the "Super Turbo Fire V8" option producing {{convert|283|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with a [[fuel injection]] system. The vast majority of cars were had engines with carburetors. While considered to be a milestone vehicle design, General Motors discontinued the original Nomad Sport Wagon at the end of the 1957 model year due to low sales and the introduction of a new body for 1958.

*'''1958''' For the 1958 model year, Chevrolet moved the Nomad name to its top-line four-door Bel Air-based station wagon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons/1958%20Chevrolet%20Wagons-02-03.html |title=1958 Chevrolet Wagons brochure |pages=2-3 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; right above the new mid-priced Biscayne based Brookwood. This was the only four-door Bel Air-based Nomad station wagon. Like the rest of Chevrolet's 1958 full-size car line up, the Nomad featured Chevrolet's new "Safety-Girder" cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adapted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these "x-frames" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet/1958_Chevrolet_Wagons/1958%20Chevrolet%20Wagons-06-07.html |title=1958 Chevrolet Wagons brochure |pages=6-7 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1959''' In 1959, the Nomad was transferred from the Bel Air to the expanded [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]] model range, which had been the top-line Chevrolet two-door hardtop and convertible the previous year; Impala now became a separate model that included four-door cars. Nomad, still at the top was a six-passenger car. The other 1959 Chevrolet station wagons were the new [[Chevrolet Kingswood|Kingswood]] four-door, nine-passenger, the new [[Chevrolet Parkwood|Parkwood]] four-door six-passenger, the new [[Chevrolet Brookwood|Brookwood]] two-door six passengers, and Brookwood four-door six Passenger. With the [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]] gone, the Biscayne-based Brookwood was now priced lowest. The Brookwood two-door marked the short-lived return of the two-door wagon and was the basis for the new-for-1959 [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]]. The El Camino carried mid-level Parkwood (Bel Air) exterior trim, with Brookwood (Biscayne) interior.
*'''1960''' For 1960, the Impala-based Nomad four-door was revised with more conventional styling. The Kingswood and the two-door Brookwood were dropped at the end of the year along with the El Camino.
*'''1961''' In 1961, all full-size Chevrolets were restyled on the existing [[GM B platform]]. The new body styling was more trim and boxy than the 1958-60 models. Chevrolet continued to use the Nomad name until the end of the 1961 model year when all Chevrolet station wagons adopted the names of the regular sedan models for 1962. The Nomad had body-on-frame construction, using the "X" frame to the end.

Between 1968 and 1972 the names Nomad and Nomad Custom were applied to the lowest-priced [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] four-door station wagon model, below the Chevelle Greenbrier, Chevelle Concours, and Chevelle Concours Estate.

*'''1968''' For 1968, Chevelle got a new body style (though still under the 817 and 817 internal designations) emphasized the "Coke bottle" look even more. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights on each fender, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967. This explains why some '68s had shoulder belts, and some early-production cars did not. However, all '68s had anchored for the belts. Manual transmission cars got GM's "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" smog pump, which added complexity under the hood.
*'''1969''' By 1969, each Chevrolet station wagon regained its own unique model name. All '69 Chevelles also got a new locking steering column, one year ahead of the Federal requirement. Headrests, required for all cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1969, were installed on all '69 GM cars.
*'''1970''' The 1970 Chevelle Nomad had even more restyling. Each [[head lamp]] was put in its own chrome housing and was no longer integrating into the grille. The body lines were less swept and a new integrated rear bumper was used.
*'''1971''' For 1971, all Chevelles got two big headlights in place of the quads, and GM mandated all divisions design their engines to run on lower-octane regular, low-lead or unleaded gasoline due to tightening emission requirements and in anticipation of the [[catalytic converter]] that would be used on 1975 and later models, necessitating the use of unleaded fuel. To permit usage of the lower-octane fuels, all engines featured low compression ratios (9:1 and lower; well below the 10.25-11.25:1 range on high-performance engines of 1970 and earlier).
*'''1972''' The last Nomad station wagon ended with the end of the second-generation Chevelle at the end of the 1972 model year.

==1976 Chevy Vega wagon Nomad package==

In 1976, special Vega Nomad wagons were assembled with unique side window trim and filler panels (to make the 'b' pillars appear forward-slanted), tailgate rub strips, vinyl Nomad script identification.

==Chevy Van Nomad==

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the name returned again on a trim package for the full-size [[Chevrolet Van]]. It featured five-passenger seating with swiveling captain seats up front, a bench in the middle, and a spacious cargo area in the rear with no quarter windows. It could be had with plaid [[upholstery]] and two-tone paint. It was offered along with Sportvan, CaraVan, Commercial Van, and Cube Van.

==South African Chevrolet Nomad==
In South Africa, a small utility vehicle called the '''Chevrolet Nomad''' appeared in 1976. To save development costs and to keep the price low, the ladder-framed vehicle was only available with [[rear-wheel drive]] and a locally built [[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|2.5-liter cast-iron]] [[inline-four engine]], also of Chevrolet origins. Nonetheless, a combination of ample ground clearance, a short wheelbase, and light-weight, meant that off-road capabilities remained respectable.&lt;ref name=SAM1076&gt;{{cite journal | ref = SAM1076 | journal = SA Motor | title = Chevrolet Nomad | page = 29 | last = Howard | first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = October 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wheelbase is {{convert|2083|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the ground clearance {{convert|265|mm|in|abbr=on}}. It also has a sump guard and a sturdy steel box-section grille to protect the radiator and headlamps.&lt;ref name=Samp31&gt;[[#SAM1076|Howard]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Nomad was only available with an open two-door body, with a folding front window and an available soft-top or fiber-glass hardtop. The design was simple, entirely of flat panels designed for ease of construction and to enable local parts content to be maximized - at 82 percent it was the highest achieved yet in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Samp33&gt;[[#SAM1076|Howard]], pp. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine, also used in the [[Opel Rekord Series D#ZA|Chevrolet 2500]] as well as a host of other local GM products, was tuned down for improved lower-end torque. Now fitted with a Rochester carburetor it produces {{convert|67|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&amp;nbsp;rpm, enough for a top speed of {{convert|134.8|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in a period test.&lt;ref name=Samp33/&gt; The front suspension proved weak, however, and by the time Chevrolet had redesigned it buyer resistance had already doomed the Nomad.

The '''Chevrolet Cavalier''' is a line of small cars produced for the model years 1982 through 2005 by [[Chevrolet]], and then later reintroduced in 2016 for the Chinese Market. As a rebadged variant of [[General Motors]]' [[GM J platform|J-cars]], the Cavalier was manufactured alongside the [[Cadillac Cimarron]], [[Buick Skyhawk]], [[Oldsmobile Firenza]], and [[Pontiac Sunbird|Pontiac J2000/2000/Sunbird]] at GM's  [[South Gate Assembly]] and [[Janesville Assembly Plant|Janesville Assembly]] plants, achieving its highest sales in 1984.

== Predecessors ==
The Cavalier replaced the [[Chevrolet Monza|Monza]] in North America. The Monza was available as a 2-door [[coupe]], a 3-door [[hatchback]] and a 3-door [[station wagon|wagon]] (using the same body as the discontinued [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]] wagon, the model it replaced). The inexpensive [[Chevrolet Chevette|Chevette]] was retained even as sales declined, and was formally replaced by even smaller [[captive import]]s. Both previous platforms had rear-drive layouts while the new design followed the front wheel drive trend, as in the [[Dodge Omni]] and [[Honda Civic]]. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler]] also introduced new front drive compacts. The largely successful mission of capturing the bulk of domestic compact sales would fall on the Cavalier's 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and 4-door [[station wagon]], the relatively short-lived 3-door [[hatchback]] (which replaced the Monza [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] Sport 2-door hatchback) and, in later years, a 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]. The small Cavalier even helped fill in lagging sales of the [[Compact car|compact]] [[Chevrolet Citation|Citation]].

The Cavalier first went on sale in May 1981 as a 1982 model with front-wheel-drive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/94300271/|title=J-cars 'dismal failure'|last=|first=|date=1982-04-26|work=Herald and Review|access-date=|location=Decatur, Illinois|edition=Evening|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a choice of two carbureted versions of the GM [[GM 122 engine|122]] series four-cylinder [[pushrod]] engines, and 2 and 4-door sedan, hatchback, and station wagon body styles. Convertibles were added in 1983, initial production totaling less than 1000.  The Cavalier name originated from GM's then-British subsidiary [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], who applied it to badge engineered variants of the [[Opel Ascona]], the third generation of which was the first J-body car to be released.

1983 Cavaliers offered [[throttle body]] [[fuel injection]], and a [[V6 engine]] became available in 1984. The 1984 models received a mild facelift featuring quad headlights. Z24 was introduced in 1985 for 1986 model year coupe and hatchback configurations.

The Cavalier in [[Mexico]] was identical to the [[Pontiac Sunbird]] before the [[Pontiac]] brand was officially introduced there in 1992. After that time, the Cavaliers sold there featured Sunbird body panels, as opposed to US-spec Cavalier panels. From 1993 on, the sibling marques were both offered, much in the same way as in the United States.

The Cavalier was restyled in 1987 for the 1988 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=Nov 1987|title=Cars for 1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8wDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA170|magazine=Ebony|volume=43|issue=1|page=172|pages=|doi=|issn=0012-9011|pmid=|access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-door hatchback was dropped, while the coupe, sedan, wagon and convertible carried over. The sedan and wagon were unchanged from the doors back, while the coupe's exterior was completely redesigned. This resulted in different trunk designs for the coupe and sedan. Three trim levels were available for 1988: VL, RS, and Z24. The convertible was only available as a Z24. The VL and RS came standard with the [[GM 122 engine|2.0&amp;nbsp;L&amp;nbsp;OHV&amp;nbsp;L4]] engine, now upgraded to throttle-body injection, or TBI, producing {{Convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation II|2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6]] producing {{Convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was optional on the RS and standard on the Z24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1988 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=MSN Autos | date=2013-06-06 | url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1988&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606034231/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1988&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-date=2013-06-06 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With two-door models, a 5-speed manual transmission was standard and a 3-speed automatic was optional, however the 3-speed automatic was made standard on sedans and wagons. An [[Digital dash|electronic dashboard]] was available with the RS and Z24 trims.

[[File:91-94 Chevrolet Cavalier wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1991–1994 Cavalier wagon]]

For 1989, the [[steering column]] was redesigned. The new self-aligning steering wheel was designed so as to reduce injuries in a collision by bending to conform to the driver's chest. Also, rear shoulder belts became standard on all models. RS and Z24 custom cloth seating received a new style of front bucket seats with integral headrests. The optional V6 was retooled to 130&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1989 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=HowStuffWorks | date=2007-08-04 | url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-cavalier.htm | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1990, the base engine was enlarged to a [[GM 122 engine#2200 OHV|2.2&amp;nbsp;L&amp;nbsp;OHV&amp;nbsp;L4]], and power increased to {{convert|95|hp}}. Door-mounted automatic front seatbelts were added due to US passive restraint legislation. The optional V6 engine was also upgraded to the [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation II|3.1&amp;nbsp;L&amp;nbsp;V6]] and 140 horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1990 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=MSN Autos | date=2014-08-08 | url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1990&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051438/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1990&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-date=2014-08-08 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convertible was dropped from availability to prevent internal competition with a planned [[Chevrolet Beretta|Beretta convertible]]. However, the Beretta convertible was shelved at the eleventh hour, before a 1990 Cavalier convertible could be prepared.
[[File:91-94 Chevrolet Cavalier coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1993–1994 Cavalier coupe]]

The 1991 Cavalier got a more extensive restyling that involved a new hood, bumpers, headlights, taillights, wheel covers and a redesigned interior, however with the body style remaining unchanged. Most notably, the cooling system was redesigned to draw air from the bumper, giving it a [[Ford Taurus (first-generation)|Ford Taurus]]-style bumper and grille-less nose. The new bumpers were unpainted, with the option to have them colored grey, black or white; the latter only available on white-colored models. The RS and the Z24 eschewed this for a color keyed body package. Z24 models also gained the options for a height adjustable driver's seat and a CD player. The platform and trim lines were carried over, while the convertible was brought back mid-year in the RS trim only with the V6 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Donaldson | first=Jessica | title=1990 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=conceptcarz.com | url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z12095/chevrolet-cavalier.aspx | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minor changes for 1991 also included the Alpha Tech ignition lock cylinder, which incorporated a dual-bit key that was larger and thicker in size in comparison to the old single-bit lock cylinder system that had been used for years. The lock system was intended to be a stronger deterrent to vehicle theft, but constant problems were reported with the lock jamming. It was dropped after an improved dual-bit single key system was introduced for the 1995 model year and redesign.

For 1992, the 2.2 L OHV standard engine adopted [[MPFI#Multi-point fuel injection|multi-point fuel injection]], or MPFI to improve output to {{convert|110|hp}}, however unlike the SFI version of the 2.2L in the Chevrolet Corsica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1992 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=MSN Autos | date=2012-03-02 | url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1992&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065644/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1992&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-date=2012-03-02 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convertible was now available in both RS and Z24 trims, with the V6 standard in the Z24 and optional with the RS. [[Antilock braking system|Antilock brakes]] were added as a standard feature, as [[Delco Moraine]] had managed to develop a low-cost system. Power locks were also standard, and were designed to automatically lock when the car is shifted out of park, or if the car is traveling at least 8 miles  per hour in manual transmission equipped Coupe models.

Model year 1993 brought minimal changes to the Cavalier line. The convertibles receive a glass rear window, allowing rear window defrost as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1993 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=HowStuffWorks | date=2007-08-04 | url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-cavalier.htm | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, General Motors received a new grille for the final time in this generation of the Chevrolet Cavalier.
[[File:1994 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24.jpg|thumb|left|1994 Cavalier Z24 Convertible]]
1994 models were also carryovers, as a redesign of the Cavalier was in development. The VL trim was dropped on the wagon, while the [[GM 122 engine#2200 OHV|2.2&amp;nbsp;L OHV L4]] was now converted to the SFI version found in the Corsica, which delivered an output of 120 horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1994 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=MSN Autos | date=2012-03-02 | url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1994&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065651/http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=1994&amp;make=Chevrolet&amp;model=Cavalier | archive-date=2012-03-02 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional changes included a slightly redesigned climate control interface and the power locking system being again redesigned: the doors would still lock automatically when put into gear, but they would also unlock automatically when the ignition was switched off.

The Cavalier received its first total redesign for 1995, with expanded dimensions and more aerodynamic styling, taking minor design cues from the 4th generation Chevrolet Camaro. Some of the basic styling cues remained however, such as the bumper-integrated grille, the coupes' dipped beltline, and the charcoal-colored bumpers on some base model cars. Coupe, sedan, and convertible options were offered, however the wagon model was discontinued. The car now had the available option of 15 and 16 inch wheels. By 1997, the Cavalier became the best selling car within the entire GM lineup.

For the 3rd generation, powertrain options were limited to inline-four engines. The option for a [[V6 engine]], which had been available in the first and second generation, was dropped and replaced by a new four-cylinder of similar power output. Base and RS models still retained the 2.2L pushrod four-cylinder engine (2.2&amp;nbsp;L OHV) of the previous models, which was primarily mated to a 3-speed automatic, but was available with 5-speed Manual in the two-door models, in particular the RS models. As of 1996 a new 4-speed automatic became available in any trim. The Z24 and LS convertible used the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L LD2 Quad-4 engine in 1995, but they received a new engine in 1996, the 2.4 liter DOHC [[Quad 4 engine#LD9|LD9]]. This engine produced {{Convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|155|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque and was used until 2002.

In 2000, the car gained a minor facelift consisting of bigger headlights and an improved grille, lost the "CHEVROLET" text badge at the trunklid and gained a new "CAVALIER" badge along with new "five spoke" hubcaps. The 2.4-litre engine came mated standard with the [[Getrag F23]] 5-speed [[manual transmission]] on the Z24 models, or with the optional 4-speed automatic on both the Z24 and the LS models. The Z24 only came in two-door coupe models until 2001 and featured a sport-tuned suspension, 16-inch tires, alloy wheels and improved interior electronics. Aesthetically little changed from the other models other than a ground effects kit and taller rear spoiler. In 2000 a 4-door Z24 Sedan debuted, featuring the same mechanics but having a less sporty body. The Z24 trim also received several other upgrades including a wider front sway bar and FE2 Sports Suspension for better handling characteristics, and less aggressive ABS anti-lock braking system.

In 2002, the 3-speed automatic was dropped from the base models equipped with the 2.2-L, and the 4-speed automatic became the main offering across the entire lineup, with 5-speed still available in the 2-door cars. Also, the RS was replaced by the LS Sport line, which featured the new '''[[Ecotec]]''' L61 motors ({{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|150|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque). These engines improved fuel economy, featuring the same displacement as the GM 122 Pushrod Engine (2.2&amp;nbsp;L OHV) while maintaining most of the power of the older LD9 motors. The new Ecotec motors replaced the GM 122 Pushrod Engine (2.2&amp;nbsp;L OHV) in base models in 2003, and became the sole engine choice in the entire Cavalier line-up until 2005 when the Chevrolet Cavalier was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Cobalt]].

A GM Eaton M45 [[Supercharger]] kit was also offered for the Z24 trim as well. The supercharger kit was developed and tested by General Motors and could only be installed at a GM dealer. This upgrade increased performance considerably due to a pressure of 4.7 PSI which in turn added approximately {{Convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|40|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque increase; raising the Z24's ratings to approximately {{Convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|195|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.

===Facelifts===
The third generation Cavalier had two facelifts. There was a minor one in 1999 with new front and rear bumper fascias which included revised headlamps and taillamps for 2000 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2000 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24 Review | website=auto123.com | url=https://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/2000-chevrolet-cavalier-z24/46473/ | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a more extensive refresh in 2002 for the 2003 model year, which included a complete new front end design, revised taillamps with a full-width rear reflector, a new rear spoiler and rear bumper fascia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/114176162/|title=Classifieds|last=|first=|date=2002-09-03|work=Poughkeepsie Journal|access-date=2019-08-15|page=6E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The third-generation Cavalier earned several low scores in crash tests by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. Also, IIHS fatality risks statistics rated the Cavalier among the "highest rates of driver deaths", with 150 (four-door) to 171 (two-door) driver deaths per million registered vehicle years. Average for the Cavalier class (small) was 103 (four-door) to 134 (two-door) driver deaths per million registered vehicle years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/sr/pdfs/sr4204.pdf |title=Status Report, Vol. 42, No. 4, April 19, 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127162428/http://www.iihs.org/sr/pdfs/sr4204.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IIHS gave the 1995-2005 Cavalier a "poor" overall score in their frontal offset collision test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2005 Chevrolet Cavalier | website=IIHS-HLDI crash testing and highway safety | url=https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/chevrolet/cavalier-4-door-sedan/2005 | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toyota Cavalier===
[[File:Toyota cavalier coup japan export.jpg|thumb|right|1998 Toyota Cavalier coupé (Japanese export model with [[Amber (color)|amber]] rear turn signals, [[right hand drive]] and flecked red-grey interior)]] [[File:Toyota Cavalier 1.JPG|thumb|left|Toyota Cavalier sedan (Japan)]]
As part of a wider effort to avoid additional restrictions on exports to the US, the third generation model was briefly sold in Japan by [[Toyota]] under an agreement with GM, [[Rebadging|badged]] as the {{ill|Toyota Cavalier|ja|トヨタ・キャバリエ|vertical-align=sup}}.

Aside from the fact that it was right hand drive, the Toyota Cavalier also featured a leather-wrapped shift knob, steering wheel and park brake lever, wider front fenders, [[Amber (color)|amber]] turn signals for Japanese regulations, power folding side mirrors, side turn signal repeater lights on the front fenders, and carpeting on the inside of the trunk lid. Interior seats were often flecked with color, and the rear seat had a fold-down armrest. Vehicles produced from February through December 1998 were available with a leather interior equipped with an automatic transmission only.

All models featured wheels borrowed from the [[Pontiac Sunfire]]. The Toyota Cavalier was available in 2.4G and 2.4Z trim levels. While all Chevrolet-badged Cavaliers received a facelift for 2000, the Toyota did as well with the updated center console, head-lights/hood/front bumper, tail-lights, and colors available. [[Toyota Racing Development|TRD]] made a body kit and rear wing for the Cavalier, available exclusively in Japan. The car was sold only at [[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Store]] Japanese dealerships.

The Cavalier was not the only GM product sold in Japan; the [[Saturn S-series]] was sold at Saturn dealerships (some former [[Isuzu]] dealerships) from 1996 until 2003, and some Toyota Vista Stores also retailed Saturns.

The Cavalier was entirely produced by GM in the USA at the [[Lordstown Assembly]] location, and sold from 1995–2000. The 1996-2000 Toyota Cavaliers came equipped with the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L LD9 engine, while the 1995 used the 2.3&amp;nbsp;L Quad 4. Due to the engine displacement and width dimensions ({{convert|1740|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} for the coupe, {{convert|1735|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} for the sedan ) exceeding [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] concerning exterior dimensions and maximum engine displacement, it was not considered a "compact" so it was sold as a "normal-class car" like the [[Toyota Mark II]] and [[Nissan Skyline]]. Prices for the coupe started at  2 million yen for the coupe, and  1.81 million yen for the sedan. the final Toyota Cavalier was imported in 2000.

[[File:Toyota Cavalier 2.JPG|thumb|left|Toyota Cavalier with amber side and rear turn signals]]
The introduction of the Toyota Cavalier was not the first time the Cavalier was sold in Japan. [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], a Japanese retail dealership that started importing European and North American vehicles soon after the end of World War II, sold various GM products including the Cavalier. When the decision was made to sell the Cavalier as a Toyota, this disrupted operations at Yanase. When the Toyota Cavalier was cancelled, Yanase continued to sell Chevrolet and other GM products. Yanase also provides complete maintenance services for all vehicles sold.

Due to higher than typically average [[Motor-vehicle inspection (Japan)|vehicle inspection]] costs, a fair number of these vehicles are re-exported as Japanese used cars, most notably to Australia and New Zealand. Production of the Toyota Cavalier ceased in June 2000. Despite Toyota making considerable efforts to sell the Cavalier on the domestic market, the Japanese public perceived the quality of workmanship to not be up to the standard typically expected of locally built cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Toyota Cavalier And The Truth About Japanese Import Barriers | website=The Truth About Cars | date=2010-01-19 | url=https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/01/the-toyota-cavalier-and-the-truth-about-japanese-import-barriers/ | access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was also introduced while economic conditions in Japan were beginning to decline as a result of the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] or "bubble economy" that ended in the early 1990s.

== Production ==
Most Cavaliers were built at [[Lordstown Assembly]], although they have also been produced at [[South Gate Assembly]] (1982 model year only), [[Lansing Car Assembly]] (1996-1998 coupes), [[Lansing Craft Centre]] (1996-2000 convertibles), [[Janesville Assembly]], [[Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila|Ramos Arizpe]], and [[Leeds Assembly]]. This car was discontinued in 2005, the last Cavalier rolled off the assembly line on October 6, 2005.

[[Chevrolet]] reintroduced the Cavalier name on a new China-only compact sedan below the [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]], with the Chinese name being Chevrolet Kewozi (科沃兹).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autohome.com.cn/4105/|title=【科沃兹】雪佛兰_科沃兹报价_科沃兹图片_汽车之家|date=2018-02-05|website=autohome.com.cn|language=zh|trans-title=SAIC GM Chevrolet -Kovaz|access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cavalier was introduced at the 2016 Chengdu Auto Show on September 2, 2016. It was developed on the same platform as the first generation Cruze, the [[GM Delta II platform|Delta II platform]], and uses the 1.5 liter four-cylinder engine that powers many compact GM models in China, including the [[Chevrolet Sail]]. Its pricing sets the Cavalier exactly between the smaller Sail and the more modern second generation Cruze. Deliveries started in September, with almost 10,000 units sold in its first month, but there are indications the Cavalier cannibalizes sales of the similarly priced first generation Cruze, which continues to be sold in China. As of 2018, the fourth generation Cavalier is also sold in Mexico with the same name, replacing the [[Chevrolet Sonic]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There, the 1.5 L engine produces {{convert|107|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|104|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque.

The Cavalier was updated for the 2020 model year for Mexico with minor changes, adding three new colors, new alloy design, four airbags and ABS brakes, three-point seatbelts, and stability control as well as minor changes to the interior for the LT trim line including a 7" with Chevrolet myLink and Smartphone Integration for Apple CarPlay. The 2020 Cavalier went on sale on 23 September 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://noticias.autocosmos.com.mx/2019/09/09/chevrolet-cavalier-2020-llega-a-mexico-ofreciendo-mejoras-en-seguridad-y-diseno&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Uplander''' is a [[minivan]] manufactured and marketed by [[Chevrolet]] for the model years of 2005 to 2009, replacing the [[Chevrolet Venture|Venture]] and the [[Chevrolet Astro|Astro]].

Initially marketed alongside the [[Chevrolet Venture|Venture]] and [[Chevrolet Astro|Astro]], the Uplander and its [[badge engineering|rebadged variants]], the [[Saturn Relay]], [[Buick Terraza]], and [[Pontiac Montana SV6]], were manufactured at GM's [[Doraville Assembly]]. However, due to low sales, it was discontinued in 2008 and [[General Motors]] exited the minivan market. Production ended in September 2008, as well as the closure of the Doraville Assembly plant.

The Uplander was marketed in the United States, [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], mainland [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].

==Year to year changes==
'''2005''': The Uplander was initially offered with 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Value engine#LX9|High Value 3500 LX9]] [[V6]] generating 200&amp;nbsp;hp (149&amp;nbsp;kW) and 220&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (298&amp;nbsp;N·m).&lt;ref name='05specs'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives.media.gm.com/division/2005_prodinfo/chevrolet/trucks/uplander/index.html |title=2005 Chevrolet Uplander |work=Media.GM.com |date=August 1, 2004 |accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''2006''': A 3.9&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Value engine#LZ9|LZ9]] V6, with 240&amp;nbsp;hp (179&amp;nbsp;kW) and 240&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (332 Nm) torque, was added as an option.  The GM logo was added to the front doors. A short-wheelbase model became available, but only for the fleet market.&lt;br /&gt;
'''2007''': The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[V6]] was dropped, leaving the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional [[Four-wheel drive|AWD]] system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L engine. A [[flexible fuel|flex-fuel]] version of the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 also became available for 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
'''2008''': The Uplander's last year for the United States, although production continued for export to Canada and Mexico up to the model year of 2009. The final vehicle (a 2009 Canadian version short wheelbase Pontiac Montana SV6 in Liquid Silver Metallic{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} with a roof rack) rolled off the Doraville assembly line on September 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/09/29/lights-out-gm-minivan-plant-closes-up-shop/ |author=Roth, Dan |title=Lights Out: GM Minivan plant closes up shop |work=Autoblog |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=2009-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
According to the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], the Chevrolet Uplander has an improved crash test rating than its predecessor, the [[Chevrolet Venture|Venture]]. The Uplander, [[Pontiac Montana SV6]], [[Buick Terraza]] and [[Saturn Relay]] earned the highest rating of "Good" in the IIHS offset frontal crash test, but was rated only "Acceptable" and "Poor" in the IIHS side crash test with and without the optional side airbags, respectively.

The '''Chevrolet SSR''' ('''S'''uper '''S'''port''' R'''oadster) is a [[retractable hardtop|retractable hardtop convertible]] [[pickup truck]] manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] between 2003 and 2006.

The 2003 and 2004 model years used General Motors' 5.3&amp;nbsp;[[Liter|L]] 300&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] ''[[GM small-block engine#5300|Vortec 5300]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Huizenga |first1=Paul |title=Storm on the Horizon: Tracing Today's Super SUV Origins |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/storm-on-the-horizon-tracing-todays-super-suv-origins/ |website=Driving Line |publisher=NItto Tire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance was 7.7&amp;nbsp;seconds for {{convert|0-60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} with a 15.9&amp;nbsp;s/86.4&amp;nbsp;mph quarter mile run. The 2005 SSR used the {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ''[[GM LS2 engine|LS2]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] also found in the [[Chevrolet Corvette C6|C6 Corvette]], Trailblazer SS, and [[Pontiac GTO#Revival|Pontiac GTO]], and also offered a [[manual transmission]] option, the six-speed [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec]], for the first time.

For the 2006 model year, the LS2 engine featured minor modifications that boosted its output to 395&amp;nbsp;hp ([[automatic transmission]]) and 400&amp;nbsp;hp (manual), respectively. Performance improved dramatically with the LS2, the 6-speed manual version had an advertised 0-60 mph time of 5.29 seconds. In addition, GM badges were added to the vehicle.

The SSR's "[[retro]]" styled design was inspired by Chevrolet's late-1940s [[Chevrolet Advance Design|Advance Design]] trucks, in particular the 1947–1955 pickups. The vehicle rode on a [[GMT360#GMT_368|GM368]] platform specific to it, a version of the period's highly adaptable [[GMT360]], and featured a steel body [[retractable hardtop]] designed by [[Karmann]] and built by [[American Specialty Cars|ASC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20031013/SUB/310130720/production-problems-slow-chevy-ssr-introduction|title=Production problems slow Chevy SSR introduction|date=2005-12-14|website=Automotive News|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://autoweek.com/article/car-news/what-concept-chevys-ssr-more-just-new-truck-gm|title=What a Concept: Chevy’s SSR is more than just a new truck for GM|date=2003-08-03|website=Autoweek|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the truck, namely the front fenders, were made with deep draw stampings, a forming technique that had not been used in automotive stampings in decades, and required a "relearning" of the forming technique.  The production model was based on the ''SuperSport Roadster'' [[concept car]] shown at the [[Detroit Auto Show#2000|2000 Detroit Auto Show]]. An early-production SSR was the [[pace car]] for the 2003 [[Indianapolis 500]] [[auto racing|auto race]].

The SSR was introduced as a 2004 model on New Year's Eve 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Amanda Silva |title=The Chevy SSR: A Curious Conversation |url=https://www.autoinfluence.com/chevy-ssr/ |website=Auto Influence |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |date=May 15, 2015 |quote=But the coolest SSR on-screen moment came in the form of a 2003 Chevy roundup of sorts, a commercial showcasing the year’s ten new Chevrolets, directed by Michael Bay of big-budget action film acclaim, like Transformers.  How appropriate.  Airing on New Year’s Eve, this sixty-second spot introduced the SSR to the world.  A new car…uh…truck…or convertible…for the new year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of marketing efforts which included the SSR being used as the pace car for the [[2003 Indianapolis 500]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/05/15/eight-worst--indy-500-pace-cars-indianapolis/27375203/|title=Indianapolis 500: The 8 worst Indy pace cars of all time|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; it sold below expectations with under 9,000 sales at [[USD|US]]$42,000 each. Citing a 301-day supply of SSRs, [[General Motors]] in December of that year announced five weeks of layoffs at [[Lansing Craft Center]], the factory that made the SSR. On November 21, 2005, GM announced that it would close the Craft Center in mid-2006, spelling the end for the SSR. The final SSR, a unique black-on-silver model (Highest VIN 1GCES14H06B126138), was built on March 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060318/NEWS01/603180340/1001/NEWS|work=Lansing State Journal|title=Tearful workers say goodbye Last SSR rolls off Craft Center line|author=Barbara Wieland|accessdate=March 20, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015923/http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060318%2FNEWS01%2F603180340%2F1001%2FNEWS|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts estimate that 24,150 SSRs were produced in total. Of the total production, 24,112 were available for sale to the public.

==Motorsports==
An attempt was made at a land speed record using a highly modified version of an SSR during the Bonneville Speed Week in August of 2011. In spite of the team's efforts, the SSR in question was deemed ineligible to race in the class that they intended to compete in due to an air dam that did not conform to the class rules. They were permitted to race the truck for "time only" but the truck proved unstable at speeds approaching 200mph. Unfortunately the truck never reached speeds anywhere near close enough to take the record. That same year a 1996 GMC Sonoma put the class record even further out of reach by running nearly 10mph faster than the previous record.

=== Concept ===
The Orlando concept was a 5-door, 7-seat vehicle based on Chevrolet Cruze sedan. It included a two-tier grille, headlamps that flow into the front fenders and muscular fender forms that wrap around the wheels, 2.0-litre 4-cylinder turbo-diesel engine rated {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}. It was unveiled at the [[2008 Paris Motor Show]] and later at the [[North American International Auto Show#2009|2009 North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Drew |date=11 January 2009 |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/11/detroit-2009-chevy-orlando-concept-comes-stateside-production/ |title=Detroit 2009: Chevy Orlando Concept comes stateside, production version due in 2011 [w/VIDEO] |publisher=Autoblog |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, GM showed the [[GMC Granite]] small MPV concept, which is similar to the Orlando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Filipponio |first=Frank |date=19 December 2009 |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/12/19/report-gm-to-show-chevy-orlando-based-gmc-granite-and-hi-po-bui/ |title=Report: GM to show Chevy Orlando-based GMC Granite and hi-po Buick Regal in Detroit |publisher=Autoblog |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM initially intended that the Orlando would go into production in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/090114-2011-Chevy-Orlando-Small-SUV-Big-on-Space/ |title=2011 Chevy Orlando: Small SUV, Big on Space |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |date=14 January 2009 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in May 2010, GM reversed their decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nitrobahn.com/news/no-chevrolet-orlando-for-u-s-says-general-motors/ |title=No Chevrolet Orlando for U.S., says General Motors |work=Nitrobahn |date=1 May 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505021633/http://www.nitrobahn.com/news/no-chevrolet-orlando-for-u-s-says-general-motors/ |archive-date=5 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chevrolet Orlando sold in Canada starting in 2011 for the 2012 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chevrolet brings fun and functional European MPV to Canada with all-new Orlando |url=http://media.gm.ca/media/ca/en/chevrolet/vehicles/orlando/2012.html |accessdate=29 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120713150704/http://media.gm.ca/media/ca/en/chevrolet/vehicles/orlando/2012.html |archivedate=13 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The European model was available from 2011 until 2014 when most of Chevrolet's vehicles, except muscle and sports cars were permanently withdrawn from the European market, except Russia and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] member nations. Later in 2015, the Chevrolet Orlando was discontinued the Russian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wroom.ru/en/cars/chevrolet/orlando |title=Chevrolet Orlando |language=ru |website=Wroom.ru |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orlando was discontinued for the 2015 model year in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cain |first=Timothy |date=4 March 2015 |url=http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2015/03/chevrolet-orlando-discontinued-in-canada.html |title=Chevrolet Orlando Discontinued In Canada - No 2015 Model Year Orlando |website=GoodCarBadCar.net |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diesel engine for the Korean market was updated in 2015 to meet the government's Euro 6 requirement. All diesel Chevrolet Orlandos sold in Korea were equipped with a 1.6-litre inline-four CDTi engine outsourced from [[Opel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kim |first=Marie |date=2 December 2015 |url=http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/english/news/industry/13166-enthusiastic-response-gm-korea-sells-51052-units-november |title=Enthusiastic Response: GM Korea Sells 51,052 Units in November |work=BusinessKorea |accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide production of the first generation Orlando ended in 2018, following its discontinuation by GM Uzbekistan and the closure of the plant in South Korea which produced it.&lt;ref name="uz2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="korea2018" /&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS''' comprises three [[sport compact]] versions of the [[Chevrolet Cobalt]] that were built on the [[General Motors]] [[GM Delta platform|Delta platform]] at [[Lordstown, Ohio|Lordstown]] [[Lordstown Assembly|Assembly]] in [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. The three versions included two [[forced induction]] [[Inline-four engine|inline&amp;#8209;four]] [[GM Ecotec engine#Ecotec|Ecotec]] engines and a third [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] engine that was later called the '''Cobalt&amp;nbsp;Sport'''. SS is an abbreviation of [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]], a historic moniker used by [[Chevrolet]] to denote high performance upgrades that meet certain criteria.

The Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS was GM's first foray into the [[Tuner (car)|tuner]] market, launching with a {{cvt|205|hp|kW PS|0}} [[supercharger|supercharged]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine in late 2004 as a 2005 model, paired only with the [[F35 (MU3) transmission|F35]] [[Manual transmission|manual]] transmission of [[Opel]]. The following year, a naturally aspirated 1SS model equipped with GM's new 2.4&amp;nbsp;L {{cvt|171|hp|kW PS|0}} engine was added; it had both automatic and manual transmission options. Production of the supercharged version continued until 2007; after a brief hiatus the SS relaunched in the second quarter of 2008 with a more economical and powerful [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine producing {{cvt|260|hp|kW PS|0}} before all Cobalt production ended in 2010. ''([[#timeline|See timeline]])''.

The Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS received generally positive reviews, particularly the turbocharged and supercharged versions. In a 2013 review, journalist Patrick George called it the best compact car ever made by General Motors, and a potential "future classic".&lt;ref name=classic/&gt; At first release in 2004, the supercharged version was praised for its performance but drew criticism for its interior quality and exterior styling, both described as too reminiscent of its predecessor, the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]. Reports surfaced in May&amp;nbsp;2009 that General Motors planned to eliminate the Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS as early as December&amp;nbsp;2009, but they proved to be untrue.&lt;ref name=dead/&gt;&lt;ref name=kills/&gt; Production continued but ordering options for late 2010 models were limited and production of all Cobalts ended in June&amp;nbsp;2010. The car was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]],&lt;ref name=Priddle/&gt; but a high performance version comparable to the Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS was never announced and the Cruze ended production for the North American market in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GM announces $350 million for Lordstown plant to {{sic|nolink=y|bulid}} Chevy Cruze | work=[[Autoblog.com]] | date=2008-08-21 | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/21/gm-announces-350-million-for-lordstown-plant-to-bulid-chevy-cru/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727110042/http://www.autoblog.com/2008/08/21/gm-announces-350-million-for-lordstown-plant-to-bulid-chevy-cru | archivedate=July 27, 2009 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all | accessdate=2008-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model details==
===Overview===
General Motors used five different inline-four engines in the Cobalt over the course of production, and designated three as SS models.  The first was launched in 2004 as a 2005 model with a new powertrain that had debuted one year earlier on the [[Saturn Ion|Saturn ION Red&amp;nbsp;Line]]. It was available as a Supercharged coupe only. The [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LE5|LE5]] engine was the next SS to launch in late 2005 as a 2006 model, available as both a coupe and sedan for the duration of its run.&lt;ref name = six/&gt;&lt;ref name=ed8/&gt; However, in late 2007, at the same time the announcement cancelling the SS Supercharged was made, GM also announced that the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L would be renamed "Cobalt&amp;nbsp;Sport", rendering Chevrolet without a Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS for the first half of the 2008 model year. The 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LNF|LNF]] turbocharged Cobalt was the last to launch in the second quarter of 2008.  It was initially available only as a coupe until a sedan option was offered for the 2009 model year but again deleted for 2010 after less than 500 were produced.&lt;ref name=color/&gt;

All three models of the Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS feature four wheel, [[Anti-lock braking system|anti&amp;#8209;lock]] [[disc brake]]s. Compared to the base Cobalt, the SS has lower front and rear fascias for a more aggressive look with integrated [[Automotive lighting#Front fog lamps|fog lights]], side rocker moldings, interior accents, and a chrome exhaust tip. Exclusive to the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L Cobalt are a titanium‑faced sport analogue cluster with a 160&amp;nbsp;mph (260&amp;nbsp;km/h in Canada) [[speedometer]], an A‑pillar mounted boost gauge, reclining front bucket seats with two‑tone leather‑appointed seating surfaces, vertical adjusting head restraints and driver‑side lumbar and height adjusters, and a sport‑tuned FE5 suspension with a 24&amp;nbsp;mm front stabilizer bar and 22&amp;nbsp;mm rear stabilizer bar.&lt;ref name = six/&gt;

===SS Supercharged===
[[File:Cobalt SS Supercharged.jpg|thumb|SS Supercharged racing]]
Available as a coupe only, the SS&amp;nbsp;Supercharged featured the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LSJ|LSJ]] Ecotec engine with an [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] M62 [[Roots type supercharger]] and air‑to‑liquid [[intercooler]].&lt;ref name=bw/&gt;  The engine makes {{cvt|205|hp|kW|0}} at 5600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{cvt|200|lbft|Nm|0}} at 4,400&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name = six/&gt; 18‑inch broad spoke wheels with P215/45R18 summer [[Pirelli]] tires were standard. Optional for the LSJ was a performance package coded G85 that added [[Recaro]] bucket seats and a [[limited slip differential]] (LSD). LSD was optional for 2005 models (performance package came with LSD) and was standard in models from 2007 to 2010. The G85 option continued in the LNF Cobalt, but added only the LSD. The car became notable for a high‑profile spoiler that was standard in 2005, but optional from 2008 when a lower profile spoiler used on all other Cobalt coupes became an option.&lt;ref name = seven&gt;{{cite web | title = 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt  | publisher=General Motors | url = http://archives.media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_cobalt/07index.html |accessdate=2008-10-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114040220/https://archives.media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_cobalt/07index.html |archivedate=2016-01-14 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM offered dealer-installed performance upgrade packages called "stage kits" that were covered by factory warranty.&lt;ref name=stg&gt;{{cite web| title = Cobalt Stage Kits &amp; Stage Kit Accessories|url=http://www.crateenginedepot.com/Cobalt-Stage-Kits-Stage-Kit-Accessories-C690.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416055002/http://www.crateenginedepot.com/Cobalt-Stage-Kits-Stage-Kit-Accessories-C690.aspx |archivedate=2016-04-16 |df=mdy-all |url-status=live |work=Crate Engine Depot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Stage&amp;nbsp;1 kit consists of new fuel injectors and a reprogram of the [[Engine control unit|ECU]], and yields up to a {{cvt|30|hp|kW}} improvement. The Stage 2 kit consists of new fuel injectors and the same reprogram with a smaller serpentine belt and pulley for the supercharger, producing a {{cvt|36|hp|kW|0}} improvement and {{cvt|18|lbft|Nm|0}} of torque. Both {{nowrap|stage 1 and 2}} kits increase the engine redline to 7,000&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name = stg/&gt; The Stage&amp;nbsp;3 kit consists of a smaller, {{cvt|76|mm|in|1}} supercharger pulley, a 2‑pass intercooler end plate and a customizable replacement ECU. The Stage 3 ECU allows for the use of a 50‑shot of nitrous, 100&amp;nbsp;octane fuel and an adjustable redline from 6,750 to 8,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Stage&amp;nbsp;3 produces {{cvt|248|hp|kW|0}} using 93 octane fuel, up {{cvt|260|hp|kW|0}} using 100&amp;nbsp;octane fuel, and much higher power with nitrous.

Wheel hop, [[wheelspin]], and a general lack of traction were problems frequently encountered with the supercharged Cobalt due to its front drive setup and relatively high torque. Upgraded front and rear trans and motor mounts would help to alleviate these issues.&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; The GM Performance Division later tried to rectify these problems in the turbocharged car by providing wider, stickier tires and stronger [[axle]]s.&lt;ref name = ab/&gt;

Turbocharged Cobalt owners have found that better times can be achieved while racing when the car is manually launched.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} These features help propel the car from 0 to {{cvt|60|mph|km/h}} in 5.5&amp;nbsp;seconds, and a quarter mile time of 13.9 seconds at {{cvt|102.5|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name = 08mt&gt;

[[File:Cobalt SS 2.4.jpg|thumb|left|A blue granite SS 2.4&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated coupe]]

===SS Naturally aspirated===
Chevrolet introduced a naturally aspirated Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS in the fall of 2005 as a 2006 model, available as both a coupe and sedan. It featured the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#LE5|LE5]] Ecotec engine with [[variable valve timing]], making {{cvt|171|hp|kW|0}} at 5,600&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{cvt|163|lbft|Nm|0}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm, later upped to {{cvt|167|lbft|Nm}} at 4,500&amp;nbsp;rpm. The LE5 engine was paired with a 5-speed manual (or optionally the [[GM 4T40 transmission|4T45]] 4‑speed automatic)  for 2006 and was introduced on both the FWD Delta platform and RWD [[GM Kappa platform|Kappa platform]]. For the 2006 and 2007 model years the car was called SS, or "1SS", but was replaced with the moniker "Cobalt&amp;nbsp;Sport" for 2008 with the anticipated introduction of the turbocharged&amp;nbsp;SS; it is the [[Getrag F23 transmission]] with different ratios from the F35 in the forced induction cars, and is the same transmission that Chevrolet mated to the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#L61|L61]] engine in the Cobalt&amp;nbsp;LS and LT.&lt;ref name = six&gt;{{cite web

Other changes over the supercharged car are notable but not drastic; 17‑inch broad spoke wheels with narrower P205/50R17 all‑season [[Pirelli]] tires were standard, as was the low profile spoiler. 2.4&amp;nbsp;L and 2.2&amp;nbsp;L Sport Package Cobalts have a 140&amp;nbsp;mph (220&amp;nbsp;km/h in Canada) speedometer with optional white face gauges. The car rides on the FE3 suspension, superior and more sport‑tuned to that of base Cobalts but less refined than the FE5 on the supercharged and turbocharged cars. Brakes on the 2.4 &amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated and supercharged model are identical, but the turbocharged model received an upgraded [[Brembo]] braking system.&lt;ref name = six/&gt; The front and rear bumpers are the same, but the front lacks a lip accessory and the bottom of the rear fascia is slightly different.&lt;ref name = six/&gt; With the exception of exterior styling and some interior trims, the vehicle is identical to the [[Pontiac G5|Pontiac&amp;nbsp;G5&amp;nbsp;GT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Reviews of the supercharged Cobalt SS were generally positive. While the Cavalier received very negative reviews,&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt; the supercharged Cobalt was seen as an improvement, and a worthy first entry for GM into the tuner market. However, the general fit and finish was poor, and power levels were not up to par with other competitors. Journalist Thom Blackett said, "When compared with more contemporary cars including the [[Dodge SRT-4|Dodge Neon&amp;nbsp;SRT&amp;#8209;4]] and the [[Subaru Impreza WRX|Subaru&amp;nbsp;WRX]], that SS badge seems to lose some of its luster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The powertrain of the 2008 turbocharged Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS received rave reviews. John Neff of ''Autoblog'' said, "The GM Performance Division completely reworked the Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS for 2008, swapping in a more powerful turbocharged engine, upgrading the rest of the mechanicals, and tweaking the entire package on the world's most demanding race tracks, including the famed Nürburgring in Germany. The result is – and we're not kidding here – the most impressive performance car to wear a bow&amp;#8209;tie badge on sale today." Journalists were impressed with the performance of the car in relation to the price; Neff added that the "2009 Cobalt SS Turbo is freakishly good at going fast and the best bang for the buck value below $30,000."&lt;ref name=neff/&gt; Ron Kiino of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' said, "at only $22,995, the SS could stand for Super Steal."&lt;ref name = 08mt/&gt; The [[Suggested retail price|MSRP]] was raised to $24,095 for the 2009 model year.

The [[Nürburgring]]‑tuned suspension gives the Cobalt&amp;nbsp;SS some of the best handling characteristics of any General Motors front wheel drive vehicle,&lt;ref name = cd/&gt; and the suspension is stiffer and more refined than the supercharged car. Since the interior is hardly changed other than the seats, those criticisms remain. Of the interior in the turbocharged sedan, ''[[Car and Driver]]'' said it "is constructed primarily of plastics cheap enough to be rejected from a Chinese toy factory; the [[Tata Nano]] probably has a fancier parking&amp;#8209;brake lever."&lt;ref name=Gall/&gt; The new Cobalt was the winner in its price class (under $30,000) of ''Car and Driver's'' 2008 Lightning Lap competition at [[Virginia International Raceway]], beating lap times of several cars in the $30,000-$60,000 class including the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Chevrolet Lumina''' is a nameplate that was used by the [[Chevrolet]] division of [[General Motors]] used from 1989 to 2001. As the Chevrolet division sought to consolidate its mid-size nameplates under a single product range, the Lumina was offered as a two-door coupe and a four-door sedan; a mechanically unrelated minivan was produced under the [[Chevrolet Lumina APV]] nameplate.&lt;ref name="Network"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automotive.com/chevrolet/lumina/t3-13-3/|title=Chevrolet Lumina |website=Automotive.com |access-date=2016-01-29 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160203175401/http://www.automotive.com/chevrolet/lumina/t3-13-3/ |archive-date=2016-02-03 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Produced upon the GM10 platform (later designated the [[GM W platform]]), the Chevrolet Lumina replaced both the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]; smaller than the Chevrolet Astro, the Lumina APV replaced the Celebrity station wagon. In 1994, the Chevrolet Lumina was redesigned, with the two-door coupe adopting the Monte Carlo nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/chevrolet/monte-carlo/Model-History |title=Chevrolet Monte Carlo model history |website=NADAguides |access-date=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2000, the Lumina was replaced by the revival of the Chevrolet Impala nameplate, retaining the W platform through the 2016 model year.

Both the first and second generations of the Chevrolet Lumina were sourced from [[Oshawa Car Assembly]] in [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa, Ontario, Canada]]. From 1998 to 2013, a rebadged variant of the [[Holden Commodore (VX)|Holden Commodore]], built by GM's Australian subsidiary [[Holden]], was sold in the Middle East and South Africa as the Chevrolet Lumina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2007/11/02/chevrolet-special-vehicles-debuts-in-middle-east-with-the-cr8/ |title=Chevrolet Special Vehicles debuts in Middle East with the CR8 |last=Nunez |first=Alex |website=Autoblog |access-date=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American Chevrolet Lumina was based on the mid-size [[GM W platform|GM W-body]], which was shared with the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] (later [[Oldsmobile Intrigue|Intrigue]]), [[Buick Regal]], and [[Buick Century]] (after 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Curbside Classic: 1990-94 Chevrolet Lumina – Not Quite Saving The Best ‘Til Last|url = http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-1990-94-chevrolet-lumina-not-quite-saving-the-best-til-last/ |website= Curbside Classic |access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Lumina became a popular seller, GM was widely criticized in the motoring press for being late to the game in introducing a direct aero-designed competitor to the [[Ford Taurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Behind the Wheel: Ford Taurus G vs. Chevrolet Lumina;Some Cheap Shots In the Price Fight|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/automobiles/behind-wheel-ford-taurus-g-vs-chevrolet-lumina-some-cheap-shots-price-fight.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date = 1996-06-23|access-date = 2016-01-29 |issn = 0362-4331|first=Michelle |last=Krebs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lumina" name was considered by Ford in the pre-production stage of the Taurus.&lt;ref name="Curbside Classics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Snitkoff |first=Edward |title=Curbside Classic: 1986 Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable – At This Moment, You Mean Everything |url= http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-1986-ford-taurusmercury-sable-at-this-moment-you-mean-everything/ |website=Curbside Classics |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chevrolet Lumina's first generation ended production in August 1994, making this the shortest-lived generation of the first-generation GM W-body cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Chevrolet Lumina |url= http://www.thenewautos.net/new-chevrolet-lumina/ |website=www.thenewautos.net |access-date=2016-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160202212622/http://www.thenewautos.net/new-chevrolet-lumina/|archivedate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dale Sr 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Lumina in NASCAR in 1994]]
In 1989, the Lumina became the nameplate under which Chevrolets were raced in [[NASCAR]], more than a year before the model was available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lumina To Make Its Nascar Finale |url= http://articles.dailypress.com/1994-11-09/sports/9411090010_1_monte-carlo-rear-downforce-rear-wheel |website=tribunedigital-dailypress |access-date=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, NASCAR received many letters complaining about the unfair advantage of Chevrolet racing an "aluminum" car.

Chevrolet signed a deal with [[Disney-MGM Studios]] to make the 1990 Lumina the company's Official Car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jalopnik.com/5980334/the-1990-chevrolet-lumina-is-the-official-car-of-disney-mgm-studios |title=The 1990 Chevrolet Lumina Is The Official Car Of Disney-MGM Studios |first=Travis |last=Okulski |publisher=jalopnik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Lumina ads included Disney animated characters from [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]] under license from Disney; In return, the Lumina was made the official car of [[Disney World]]. In one sequence, advertising the car’s spacious interior, cartoon hippopotami were used to demonstrate the Lumina's wider rear door swings which Chevrolet claimed made for easier access to the rear seat area. While popular, the ads were soon cancelled when focus groups revealed that they remembered the Disney characters better than they remembered the car itself.

[[File:Lumina Z34.jpg|thumb|left|1991–1994 Chevrolet Lumina Z34]]
Starting in 1990, Chevrolet offered a high performance version of the Lumina, the '''Lumina Z34'''. It came standard with the FE3 sport suspension package, the 210&amp;nbsp;hp [[LQ1]] V6 engine shared with the '''Lumina Euro 3.4''' (sedan), the five-speed [[Getrag]] 284 manual transmission, dual exhaust, and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. 

The Z34 also featured cosmetic changes to go along with the performance enhancements such as unique front and rear fascias, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a louvered hood, a unique steering wheel and sport bucket seats. Performance figures included a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (0–97&amp;nbsp;km/h) time of 7.2 seconds, a 1/4 mile (~400 m) time of 15.0 seconds, a (limited) top speed of 130&amp;nbsp;mph (209.21&amp;nbsp;km/h), a 60-0&amp;nbsp;mph (97–0&amp;nbsp;km/h) distance of in 153&amp;nbsp;ft (47 m), and a lateral acceleration of 0.79 g (7.7&amp;nbsp;m/s²). A Bose stereo system and automatic transmission, which lowered the horsepower rating to 200 and 0-60 time by .5 seconds, were optional. The only paint colors available for the Z34 were white, red, black, gray, silver, and light blue. In 1995, the Lumina Z34 was replaced with the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fifth Generation|Chevrolet Monte Carlo Z34]].

General Motors began development of an updated Lumina in 1989, under chief engineer Norm Sholler, planned for a late 1992 launch. By 1991, a final body design was approved. Development eventually took longer than planned, delaying launch by 18 months. The redesigned Lumina was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 1994 as a 1995 model. The 1995 Lumina received a rounded body, increasing its size, as well as an updated interior. Unlike its other [[GM W platform|W platform counterparts]], the Lumina retained the first-generation chassis. Replacing the Lumina two-door [[coupe]] was the resurrected [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]]. The LH0 V6 was dropped in favor of the [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#L82|L82 V6]], known as the 3100 SFI; the latter engine produced 20 more horsepower from the same displacement due to a revised intake manifold and cylinder heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-02-07/business/9303176480_1_chrysler-concorde-sedans-model-years |title=Big Three Hope Makeovers Will Win Converts |first=Paul |last=Lienert |publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-06-06/travel/9306060421_1_gm-general-motors-corp-designs|title=Fast-Paced World Of Family Sedans Passing GM By |first=Doron P. |last=Levin |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;autosofinterest.com/2014/01/05/design-notes-1995-chevrolet-lumina-sedan/2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-13/news/vw-11485_1_city-car |title=In 2000: Future Stock: Sorry, cars won't fly or walk on water.

Initial trim levels consisted of ''base'' and ''LS''; the latter replacing the "Euro" trim. Options included an electric sunroof, leather bucket seats, power windows, power driver seat, and an AM/FM stereo with CD player. This Lumina was also sold with police (code 9C3) and taxi packages, because the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] was discontinued after the 1996 model year. Production began on Monte Carlo coupes in February 1994 and March 7, 1994 for Lumina sedans at GM's Oshawa manufacturing plant, for a June 6, 1994 market launch for the 1995 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.autonews.com/article/19940221/ANA/402210747/chevrolet-rolls-out-its-comeback-cars-monte-carlo-lumina-lead-mid-sized-assault |title=Chevrolet Rolls Out Its Comeback Cars: Monte Carlo, Lumina Lead Mid-Sized Assault |date=February 21, 1994 |website=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''LTZ''' trim was introduced in 1996 for the 1997 model year because the Impala SS and Caprice were discontinued. Standard features included 16" brushed aluminum wheels, blackwall radial sport tires, sport tuned suspension, a 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 rated at {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|185|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} or an optional 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6 rated at {{convert|215|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, a rear spoiler, restyled front and rear body clips (resembling the Monte Carlo Z34), a tachometer, and a floor-mounted shifter.

In 1997 for MY 1998, the 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6 was replaced by the 3800 Series II which produced {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|225|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. Despite its increased torque, the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L LTZ demonstrated slightly worse performance due to its lowered horsepower, with 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (0–97&amp;nbsp;km/h) times of 7.5 seconds (as opposed to 7.2 seconds for the LQ1) and 1/4 mile (~400&amp;nbsp;m) times of 15.7 seconds (as opposed to 15.5 seconds for the LQ1). The car has a computer-limited top speed of {{convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and the rev limiter kicks in at 5,800 rpm for the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L (rev limiter is at 7,000 rpm for the 3.4&amp;nbsp;L LQ1).

Also in 1997, the 1998 model year Luminas received second generation airbags. The front-wheel drive [[Chevrolet Impala]] was introduced as a replacement for the Lumina in 1999, although GM produced 2001 model year Luminas to be exclusively sold for rental fleets. Retail sales of the Lumina ended in Canada in 1999, with the United States following a year later. Fleet production ended on April 26, 2001. In some Asian countries, the Lumina continued as a rebadged Buick Century/Regal. 

=== Trim levels ===
Throughout its life cycle, the second generation Lumina was available in three trim levels:

'''Base''' (1995–2001): The most popular Lumina had standard front row bench seat with seating for six passengers, power locks, tilt steering wheel, dual airbags, and air conditioning. Base models were equipped with fifteen-inch steel wheels with wheel covers.

'''LS''' (1995–1999): The mid-level trim models included aluminum wheels, optional dual zone temperature controls, power windows (optional on Base), tachometer, higher-end stereo with GM's Delcolock, anti-lock brakes, remote keyless entry system, upgraded seats, and an optional 3.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC engine (1995-1996).

'''LTZ''' (1997–1999): The top of the line Lumina included alloy wheels, a choice of the 3.1&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine, 3.4&amp;nbsp;L DOHC engine (1997) and the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine (1998-1999), power driver seat, dual zone climate control and leather with the option for deluxe cloth. A center console was standard on LTZ (optional on LS). Exterior differentiation included the front end, trunk lid, and taillights from the Fifth Generation [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fifth generation|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]].

The Australian GM subsidiary, Holden, manufactured a third and fourth generation Lumina based on the rear-wheel drive Commodore (VX, VZ and VE series) sedan, [[sport utility]] and coupé (the latter body not available with the fourth generation VE series).

This model was exclusively manufactured for export primarily to the Middle East and South Africa. Luxury specifications of these sedans were also exported in Brazil as the [[Chevrolet Omega]].

High-performance models were powered by Chevrolet V8 engines, including the high specification [[Pontiac G8]] based on the VE Series, exported to the United States.

The '''Chevrolet Chevette''' is a [[rear-wheel drive|front-engine, rear-drive]] [[subcompact car|subcompact]] manufactured and marketed by [[Chevrolet]] for model years 1976-1987 as a three-door or five-door [[hatchback]].  Introduced in September 1975, the Chevette superseded the [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]] as Chevrolet's entry-level subcompact, and sold 2.8 million units over 12 years.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; The Chevette was the best-selling small car in the U.S. for model years 1979 and 1980.

The Chevette employed General Motors' global [[GM T platform (RWD)|T platform]]. Worldwide, GM manufactured and marketed more than 7 million&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; T-cars  &amp;mdash; [[badge engineering|rebadged variants]] using the T platform &amp;mdash; including the Pontiac Acadian in Canada, Pontiac T1000/1000 in the United States (1981-1987), K-180 in Argentina, Vauxhall Chevette, Opel Kadett, Isuzu Gemini, Holden Gemini, and as a coupe utility (pickup), the Chevy 500. A T-car variant remained in production in South America through 1998.

Introduced on a full-color nationwide campaign in 140-50 of the country's largest daily papers,&lt;ref name="righthandpages"&gt;{{cite news

It was a response to the federal CAFE standards and the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The Chevette was prompted by GM's Energy Task Force, which arose out of the crisis and the resultant shift in consumer demand to smaller, foreign vehicles boasting greater fuel efficiency.

The Chevette used as its basis GM's World Car, "Project 909" &amp;mdash; what would become the T-car program, so named because the vehicles shared GM's T platform.  With the well-known problems of its predecessor, the [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]], which included production issues, reliability problems, and a serious propensity for corrosion, the team reworked the international platform such that the Chevette shared not a single body panel with another T-car and reworked the underbody extensively to enhance corrosion protection.&lt;ref name="formalhistory"/&gt; The Chevette's 1.4-liter base iron-block engine weighed 59&amp;nbsp;lb less than the Vega's much-heralded aluminum-block engine.&lt;ref name="formalhistory"/&gt;

The Chevette was officially launched on September 16, 1975, in Washington, DC, just after new legislation-mandated [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards. With initial projected sales of 275,000 units in its first year,&lt;ref name="formalhistory"/&gt; numbers were cut in half as the price of oil stabilized. The Chevette ultimately reached 2,793,353 sales for its entire production across the 12 model years 1976-1988.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global T-car sales  surpassed 7 million in the end.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;  The last Chevette was manufactured on December 23, 1986, at [[Lakewood Assembly]] &amp;mdash; following the end of production at [[Wilmington Assembly]] in September, 1985.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;  The last Chevette manufactured was a light-blue two-door hatchback shipped to a Chevrolet dealer in Springdale, Ohio.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;

The T-car had been launched internationally in Brazil under the Chevette name in 1973, as a two-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and ultimately a four-door sedan, a two-door [[hatchback]], and a two-door [[station wagon]] (named "[[Chevrolet Marajó|Marajó]]"), as well as a [[pickup truck|pickup]] (named the "[[Chevrolet Chevy 500|Chevy 500]]"), produced until 1994.

The Chevette itself was initially available only as a two-door hatchback with a 1.4-liter OHV or 1.6-liter OHC gasoline [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] engine.  Engines produced from {{convert|53|to|60|hp}} (subsequently {{convert|53|to|70|hp}}), driving the rear wheels. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard, while a three-speed [[automatic transmission]] was optional. Other features included rack-and-pinion steering, front disc brakes, front stabilizer bar, 13-inch tires, tricolor taillights, front bucket seats, an onboard diagnostic system, extensive acoustic insulation, a single steering column-mounted stalk (integrating controls for signal indicators, wipers, and windshield washers) and optional swing-out rear quarter windows. Front seats featured inertia locking mechanisms that enabled entry and exit adjustment of the front seatback without using a separate release.&lt;ref name="curbside"&gt;{{cite web

Pontiac marketed a [[badge engineering|rebadged variant]] in Canada as the "Acadian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mays|first=James C.|title=1980 Pontiac Acadian|url=http://www.oldcarscanada.com/2010/04/1908-pontiac-acadian.html|work=www.oldcarscanada.com|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the smallest, most fuel-efficient car marketed by Chevrolet, the Chevette was the lightest car marketed in the U.S. The EPA rated the base 1.4-liter engine at {{convert|28|mpgus}} city and {{convert|40|mpgus}} highway. Chevrolet claimed that the Chevette's turning circle (30.2&amp;nbsp;feet) was one of the smallest in the world and that it was essentially a "metric" car, "international in design and heritage".&lt;ref name="The Editors of Consumer Guide"&gt;The Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976-1978 Chevettes can be identified by round headlights and  chrome-rimmed, tricolor taillights.

Chevrolet marketed optional "Rally" and "Woody" packages, as well as the least expensive "Scooter" model. The Rally 1.6 included a 1.6-liter (98&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in) engine in lieu of the 1.4-liter (85&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in) overhead-cam four-cylinder, rated at {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} instead of {{convert|52|hp|abbr=on}}, along with a rear stabilizer and special body graphics. The Chevette Woody (1976) featured simulated wood-grain siding and upgraded interior and exterior trim. The Scooter was offered as a base model with a $2,899 [[suggested retail price]], two front passenger seats, an optional rear seat, deletion of most exterior chrome (e.g., window surrounds), painted rather than chrome bumpers, an open glove box, black carpeting, door pull straps in lieu of arm rests, fiberboard door panels, and a passenger seat without fore-aft adjustment.  A total of 9,810 ''Scooter'' models were manufactured, compared to 178,007 regular hatchbacks.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

[[File:1977 Chevette.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Chevrolet Chevette two-door hatchback]]

In 1977, the engines offered were {{convert|57|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|63|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The Scooter hatchback included a rear seat, while offering a rear seat delete option. The Sandpiper trim package included a “reef”-patterned interior, deluxe door trim, cream gold or antique white exterior colors, and an exterior Sandpiper logo just behind each door.

In 1978, models had a revised grille with a grid design, while the grille and headlight frames were chromed for standard models, a four-door hatchback riding on a {{convert|97.3|in|mm|adj=mid}} [[wheelbase]] was added — two inches longer than the two-door — and this version accounted for more than half of the Chevette's nearly 300,000 sales. The 1.4-liter engine and Woody package were dropped with a fuel door added. A TH-180 automatic transmission was added to replace the THM-200 series automatic. An "HO" (high output) version available in addition to the standard 1.6-liter, featuring a modified head and larger valves-cam profile. The HO package also included a dual-outlet exhaust manifold. Prices were dropped and more standard equipment was added for 1978. Air conditioning, radial tires, an AM/FM radio, and power brakes were optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | type = brochure | title = The 1978 Chevy Chevette | pages = 10–11 | url = http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Chevrolet/1978_Chevrolet/1978-Chevrolet-Chevette-Brochure/1978-Chevrolet-Chevette-10-11 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180115071750/http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/Chevrolet/1978_Chevrolet/1978-Chevrolet-Chevette-Brochure/1978-Chevrolet-Chevette-10-11 | archivedate = 2018-01-15 | id = 3578 | date = July 1977 | publisher = Chevrolet Motor Division }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the Holley two-barrel [[carburetor]] became standard on all models. The front fascia was revised with a flat hood, no longer wrapping down to the bumper. New for 1979 was a large chrome grille with Chevrolet's "bow-tie" emblem and square headlights. A new air-injection system was introduced to improve catalytic converter function at idle. An active passenger-restraint system was introduced in small numbers as an option which featured a lower hanging dashboard, automatic seatbelts, and a center dash console. Chevette sales totaled more than 451,000 units — a figure that would rank it second only to Chevy's new [[Chevrolet Citation|Citation]], which had a much longer model run (sales had started in April 1979). ''Consumer Guide'' testers managed "an honest 29&amp;nbsp;mpg in the city and 39&amp;nbsp;mpg on the highway". The 1980 rear fascia was revised with a squared-off hatch, wraparound taillights with combined, single colored turn signals, and a round gas-filler door.

In 1981, a diesel engine option was new with a late 1981 availability — this is a 1.8-liter [[Isuzu]] unit only available coupled to an Isuzu five-speed.&lt;ref name=AW81&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Autoweek]] | last = Ross | first = Daniel Charles | page = 10 | date = 1981-08-24 | title = Chevrolet builds Detroit's top econocar... with a little help from Japan | issn = 0192-9674 | volume = 31 | number = 34 | publisher = Crain Press Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|51|hp|kW|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} powertrain is the same as was installed in the [[Isuzu I-Mark]]. It was not available with air conditioning.&lt;ref name=AW81/&gt; New styled-steel wheels with center caps were offered. and the previous wheel and hubcap design was discontinued. Domestic models received a new computer command control feedback system on gasoline engines. The HO option was discontinued. Electronic spark timing was used on 1981 models in place of manual timing advance. A new engine [[cylinder head]] design (swirl-port) was introduced to improve low-end [[torque]] and [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. The Pontiac T1000 was introduced in the spring of 1981, which shared all body stampings with the Chevette, featuring a chrome center with black-trimmed grille and headlight buckets, as well as standard chrome window trim with black area fill.&lt;ref name=lienert1&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Autoweek]] | last = Lienert | first = Paul | page = 12 | date = 1981-08-24 | title = A pleasant small car, but no threat to imports | issn = 0192-9674 | volume = 31 | number = 34 | publisher = Crain Press Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The T-1000 also has additional fresh-air vents at the outer ends of the dashboard.&lt;ref name=AW81/&gt; Power steering was a new option for the Chevette, as well as a 3.36 axle ratio (standard on T-1000 models). The active passenger-restraint system was discontinued. New lighter-weight bucket seats were introduced that lacked much of the lower support of the heavier "panned" seats. A new adhesive-based, thinner windshield seal replaced the lock-ring type.

In 1982, models featured a five-speed manual transmission option on gasoline-powered two-door cars (standard with diesel). The Scooter was newly  available as a four-door hatchback. New GM THM-180C (THM200C for diesel model) automatic transmissions, which included a locking torque converter for greater fuel mileage, were available. Introduction of a pump-driven AIR system in the late model year replaced PAIR to help efficiency of the catalytic converter. A new catalytic converter was introduced with an air inlet for forced air injection from the air pump. A new one-piece cardboard-based headliner with an updated overhead dome light replaced the earlier vinyl liner. The Pontiac T-1000 received a unique grille, body molding, and horizontal lined taillights, as well as an alloy sport wheel option. General Motors of Canada's Pontiac Acadian, a rebadged Chevette, received all the T-1000's Pontiac-exclusive features from this point on. Chevrolet sold 433,000 Chevettes in 1981 and 233,000 in 1982.

[[File:83-85 Chevrolet Chevette 2.jpg|thumb|The revised rear of a 1983 Chevette CS, with larger, blockier taillight units]]
In 1983, the Chevettes had a makeover for the front and rear fasciae, and the Chevette CS was introduced. A black-finished grille and trim moldings replaced most chrome pieces. Scooter and base Chevettes featured black bumpers and end caps, while the higher-end Chevette CS models included color-keyed bumpers and caps with chrome bumper inserts as an option. Scooter and base models featured a black-only grille and headlight buckets, while CS models featured argent-colored trim. The Chevette S model introduced a cosmetic package that included black-painted styled-steel wheels and a red-accented grille and moldings, as well as oversized decal emblems in red. Front bucket seats featured new adjustable knobs on the sides, but lost the reclining levers of previous years. Interior trim was also blacked out with new black door handles and black plastic window regulators. An integrated cassette deck was optional with the stereo package. A chrome strip on the dashboard was available only on CS and S models until the end of production. Deluxe door panels were discontinued and all models featured plastic door panels, but base and Scooter models still featured laminated cardboard cargo area panels. The "diagnostic connector" was removed from the wiring harness.

[[File:1986PontiacAcadianScooter.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Pontiac Acadian Scooter two-door hatchback]]
In 1984, the low-cost Scooter model was discontinued. The T1000 was renamed Pontiac 1000. The 1985 models carried few updates from the 1984 models. In 1986, the Chevette base model was discontinued, leaving only the CS and the S, which featured a [[Center high-mounted stop lamp|third brake light]] and an instrument cluster "service engine soon" light, replacing the "check engine" light.

In 1987, Chevrolet dropped the Chevette S model and the diesel engine option (after 324 were sold in 1986), and dropped the Chevette's price to $4,995. Sales fell to just over 46,000 units, and production ended on December 23, 1986. The final Chevette rolled off the assembly line in December 23, 1986. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Electrovette==
In the 1970s, [[General Motors]] Advanced Engineering developed a concept car, the Electrovette, based on the Chevette, but using an electric motor powered by lead-acid batteries.  The car had a range of about {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on}}, and a top speed of {{convert|53|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/autos/0809/gallery.gm_electric_cars/5.html | work=CNN | title=GM's long road back to electric cars | date=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leata Cabalero==
A luxury variant of the Chevette, the Leata Cabalero, was manufactured and marketed for model years 1975 and 1977 by Stinebaugh Manufacturing Company, founded by Donald E. Stinebaugh (1916-1992) with his son Leonard D. "Sonny" Stinebaugh (1946-2001) in [[Post Falls, Idaho]]. Donald Stinebaugh named the car after his wife Hilda (Erickson) Stinebaugh, giving the car her nickname, Leata &amp;mdash; a misunderstanding of ''[[wikt:litt#Norwegian Bokmål|litt]],'' Norwegian for "little."

The Leata featured power windows, power seat and cruise control &amp;mdash; as well as baroque styling with custom fiberglass body panels, round headlights in square bezels, a rectangular "classic" grille, and heavily styled fenders; 97 were made in either in pickup or hatchback body styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thedrive.com/vintage/2659/i-drove-the-worst-car-in-america | title=I Drove the Worst Car in America | work = The Drive | first = Brendan | last = McAleer | date= 2016-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chevrolet Chevette was first launched by General Motors (Brazil) in 1973 as a two-door sedan. A four-door sedan followed in April 1978, and then a three-door hatchback was added in November 1979.&lt;ref name=TAM85&gt;{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 | editor = Mastrostefano, Raffaele | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A | ref = TAM90 | year = 1985 | page = 175 | language = Italian | location = Milano | isbn = 88-7212-012-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hatchback had unique bodywork for Latin America, longer than the European Kadett City and with a notch at the base à la the period [[Ford Escort (Europe)#MkIII|Ford Escort]]. A three-door [[station wagon]] version, called the "Marajó" in Brazil, was added in September 1980, as was a sporting version of the hatchback called the 1.6 SR (with a mere four more horsepower, achieved by a somewhat higher compression ratio).&lt;ref name="TAM85.2"&gt;''[[#TAM85|Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985]]'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the Chevette received a thorough facelift with rectangular headlights, with the turn signals located underneath the headlights, a flatter hood, and a single-piece grille. The dash was also new, as were ventilation windows in the front doors. Mechanically, the 1.6 was now also available to run on [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|''gasoól'']] and a five-speed manual gearbox was available as an option.

The Latin American Chevettes underwent a series of facelifts, in 1978, 1983, and a major one in 1987, which meant new headlights and a black plastic grille. Where available, the station wagon used the Chevette name outside of Brazil.

[[File:1981 chevette.jpg|thumb|left|Brazilian-built Chevette SL sedan, 1981]]
The hatchback remained in production until 1988, while the Marajó continued to be available until 1989. [[Marajó]] is an island located at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in Brazil. The four-door sedan version was built until 1989, mainly for export to other Latin American countries. The two-door sedan remained in production until 1993, only outlived by the [[Pickup truck|pickup]] version ('''[[Chevrolet Chevy 500|Chevy 500]]'''), which continued until 1994 after having been first launched in 1983. The four-door sedan continued to be built for a few more years in Ecuador and Colombia.

[[File:GMC Chevette.JPG|thumb|left|GMC Chevette two-door (Argentina)]]
The Chevette originally appeared with a 1.4-liter inline-four of Isuzu origins, albeit with a single overhead cam rather than the pushrod model originally used in the United States. In 1981 this was augmented by a locally developed 1.6-liter version, it too with a single carburetor. The Brazilian 1.6 was somewhat larger than the Isuzu-developed [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu G engine|G161Z]] engine used in North America. For 1988, the 1.6 gained a twin-carb setup and now produced {{convert|78|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} rather than the {{convert|72|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in earlier version. This engine remained available until the end of Brazilian Chevette production. The lower-powered 1.4 was only available for gasohol as of 1981 and was discontinued entirely after 1982. A gasohol-powered version of the 1.6 appeared in its stead for 1983.

As a tax cut for sub-1-liter cars appeared in late 1990, [[General Motors do Brasil]] responded with the 1.0-litre "Chevette Junior" for early 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Aichele | editor-first = Tobias | title = Auto Katalog 1993 | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH &amp; Co. KG]] | location = Stuttgart | page = 80 | year = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This used a narrow-bore, short-stroke {{convert|50|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the OHC engine with a catalytic converter. The Junior did not do particularly well in the market, competing against the much more modern [[Fiat Uno|Fiat Uno Mille]], [[Volkswagen Gol#BX|Volkswagen Gol]], and [[Ford Escort (Europe)#Mk4|Ford Escort Hobby]].&lt;ref name=QR94&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine = Quatro Rodas | url = http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WkHDGKtJFLo/UXaENZ2niQI/AAAAAAAA8lw/SZK1QehllpY/s1600/405%252C043%252C34%252C04%252CTE.jpg | title = Guerra dos 1000 | trans-title = War of the 1000's | language = pt | page = 43 | volume = 34 | issue = 405 | date = April 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being rather underpowered and heavy at {{convert|865|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, with a top speed of {{convert|134|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, the 1.0 had a brief sales life. It only remained available until 1993, after which the [[Opel Corsa#B|Corsa]] took over.&lt;ref name=QR94/&gt; A 1.8-liter Isuzu diesel-engined version was also built in Uruguay,&lt;ref name="TAM85.3"/&gt; exclusively for the Uruguayan market. In the Brazilian market, both the 1.4 and the 1.6 were available in gasoline and [[ethanol|alcohol]] versions.

In Argentina, the Kadett C was originally marketed as the [[Opel K-180]], but between 1992 and 1995, the equivalent of the Brazilian Chevette was sold there as the [[GMC Chevette]]. Production in Colombia, where a special version for taxi usage was also built, continued until 1998. The Chevette was the number-one seller in Chile for some time, last in 1991. When [[catalytic converter]]s were made a requirement in that country, GMB was unable to develop such an engine and the Chevette was withdrawn from the Chilean market after the 1992 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bauner | first1 = David | last2 = Laestadius | first2 = Staffan | title = The introduction of the catalytic converter in Chile | journal = Journal of Transport Economics and Policy | volume = 37 | number = 2 |date=May 2003 | page = 181 | publisher = The University of Bath and the London School of Economics and Political Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1.6 million units were built in Brazil, with the Corsa replacing the Junior and the [[Opel Kadett#E|Chevrolet Kadett/Ipanema]] replacing the bigger-engined versions. About one quarter of the production was exported.

===Chevy 500===
[[File:Late Chevrolet Chevy 500 in Cosmópolis.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Chevy 500, late facelift version]]
The Chevrolet Chevy 500 was the [[coupé utility]] version of the Brazilian Chevette. Launched in 1983, it was the precursor to the Classic/[[Opel Corsa|Corsa]]/[[Chevrolet Montana|Montana]] lineup of today. It competed with offerings from several other manufacturers, including the [[Fiat Fiorino]], [[Ford Pampa]], and [[Volkswagen Saveiro]]. Its payload was {{convert|500|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. Using the 1.6-liter OHC inline four rated at 70&amp;nbsp;hp, this model continued in production until 1994, and was the last Chevette version built in Brazil, where it was replaced by the coupé utility version of [[Opel Corsa#Corsa B (1993-2000)|Chevrolet Corsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carplace.uol.com.br/carros-para-sempre-projeto-brasileiro-picape-corsa-tinha-apelo-ao-lazer/# |title=Carros para sempre: projeto brasileiro, Corsa Pick-up tinha apelo ao lazer | trans-title = Cars forever: a Brazilian project, the Corsa coupé utility appealed to leisure | first = Julio | last = Cesar | work = Carplace | date = 2015-03-20 | language = pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322055304/http://carplace.uol.com.br/carros-para-sempre-projeto-brasileiro-picape-corsa-tinha-apelo-ao-lazer/# |archive-date=2015-03-22 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grumett===
Created by Horacio Torrendell, a fibreglass-bodied version (actually based on the [[Vauxhall Chevette]]'s bodywork) called the Grumett was built in Uruguay.&lt;ref name=Grum1&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120217060331/http://www.eltelegrafo.com/index.php?idbuscar=34181 | title = Camioneta Grumett de 1981 |trans-title=Grumett truck from 1981 | url = http://www.eltelegrafo.com/index.php?idbuscar=34181 | journal = El Telegrafo | location = [[Paysandú]], Uruguay | date = 2010-08-23 | archivedate = 2012-02-17 | language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was available either as a station wagon, as a pickup, or as a double-cab pickup. This replaced an earlier version (since 1976) which used bodywork based on that of the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963–1979)|Vauxhall Viva]], as well as Vauxhall mechanics. By 1980 the Vauxhall parts had become impossible to import and Grumett switched to Chevette parts from Brazil. The Grumett used the original 1.4-liter version of the Chevette engine.&lt;ref name=Grum1/&gt; The regular Chevette was also assembled in Uruguay, by General Motors Uruguaya. It was sold there as a two- or four-door sedan, either with the 1.4 petrol or the 1.8 diesel.&lt;ref name="TAM85.3"&gt;''[[#TAM85|Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985]]'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The name '''Chevrolet Greenbrier''' was used by [[Chevrolet]] for two vehicles. The first vehicles were a 6 to 9 passenger window van version of the Corvair 95 van. The Corvair 95 series also included the Loadside pickup truck and Rampside pickup truck which had a right side ramp. All used the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] powertrain (with exhaust valve rotators for durability) in a truck body and were produced between model years 1961 to 1965. The Greenbrier name was used a second time from 1969 until 1972; for the mid level [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] [[station wagon]].

Chevrolet introduced the Corvair lineup for the 1960 model year as the first of a series of generations of passenger [[compact car]]s. Chevrolet introduced a more utilitarian style of vehicle the following year under the model designation "Corvair 95". In appearance and design the vehicles were similar to the competing [[Volkswagen Transporter]], which was essentially a bus-like adaptation of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] that moved the driver over the front wheels ([[Forward control]]), also commonly defined as a [[cab over]] vehicle.

The [[Air cooling|air-cooled]] horizontally opposed [[Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine]] was located in the rear of the vehicle under a slightly raised cargo floor. It was similar in principle to the 4-cylinder engine of the Volkswagen, but unusual for most contemporary cars. The {{convert|2375|cc|cid|0|disp=flip|abbr=on}} engine developed {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm. Engine size was increased to {{convert|2683|cc|cid|0|disp=flip|abbr=on}} for the 1964 model year, raising output to {{convert|95|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Unlike the Corvair cars, the Corvair Greenbrier had a {{convert|95|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and were thus known as "95s." They came standard with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] but could be ordered with a two-speed [[Corvair Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] (distinct from the usual [[Powerglide]]); eventually a four-speed manual was also made available.

[[File:Greenbrier (8494000958).jpg|thumb|left|Greenbrier (US)]]
[[File:Flickr - DVS1mn - 62 Chevrolet Corvair Rampside Pick-Up (2).jpg|thumb|left|1962 Rampside Pickup - rear engine placement under loadbed]]
[[File:1962 Chevrolet Corvair Greenbrier.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Chevrolet Corvair Greenbrier]]
There were essentially two different bodies available in the 95 series: the van and the truck. The base version was the panel van (Corvan) with no side or rear windows. The van was named Greenbrier. The Greenbrier normally had windows all around and six doors, although an option was to have eight doors where there were opening double doors on both sides. The Greenbrier seated up to nine people with the available third-row seat. The 95s and cars had an optional heater running off of gasoline from the vehicle's tank. The Greenbrier also had a camper option.

A Corvair truck could be ordered as a "Loadside" or "Rampside". The Loadside was essentially a pickup truck with a standard tail gate. The Loadside was only produced two years and is the rarest of the Corvairs; production totaled 2,844 in 1961 and 369 in 1962. The Rampside had a side ramp to be used for loading and unloading cargo. These were used by the [[Bell Telephone Company]], because loading and unloading of cable drums was eased by the side ramp.

Ford and Chrysler introduced [[compact van]]s of their own (the [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]), using a more conventional water-cooled engine mounted between the front seats. As these became successful, [[General Motors]] responded with its own design which placed the [[Chevy II]] sourced [[engine]] in a "doghouse" between and behind the front seats. The forward engine design allowed a flat rear floor with low deck heights in the rear of the van for loading/unloading cargo. General Motors stopped producing the truck versions of the Corvair in 1964 and the Greenbrier was the only remaining {{convert|95|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase Corvair for 1965. Eventually, Chevrolet and Volkswagen would abandon rear-engined vans in favor of conventional or front-wheel-drive water-cooled engines.

Although the Greenbriers were a limited success, passenger vans would continue to evolve through full-sized vans. The similarly sized 7–8 passenger would become a successful vehicle segment by the 1980s as alternatives to station wagons.

During the 1969 model year, the four-door station wagons of the mid-sized [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], produced since 1964, were renamed: the standard-trim station wagon known as the Chevelle 300 was renamed as the [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]], while the medium-trim Chevelle 300 Deluxe was now called the Greenbrier. The top-of-the-line model, the Chevelle Malibu 135/136, became the Concours and Concours Estate Wagon, the latter being distinguished by exterior woodgrain paneling. Except for the simplest Nomad line (which was only available in six-seater form), all station wagons could be ordered with either six or nine seats. Power came from [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]] (not available for nine-seaters) or [[V8 engine]]s.

For 1970, the Chevelle 300 Deluxe series was simply called Chevelle and the inline-six engine was no longer available in the station wagons. In 1972 the series' model code was changed to 1C. The Nomad, Greenbrier, and Concours names were all dropped for 1973, when the Chevelle was redesigned and the wagons all began sharing series names with other body styles.

The '''Chevrolet Lakewood''' is a 4 door [[station wagon]] produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1961 model year. Chevrolet dropped the "x-wood" names for their station wagon models at the end of 1961 so the 1962 Corvair Station wagons do not continue the Lakewood name.
In appearance, and technical respects it resembled the [[Volkswagen Type 3|Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback]], but power came from the Corvair's rear-mounted [[Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine]] with 146 cu.in. displacement which developed 80&amp;nbsp;bhp @ 4,400 rpm. The station wagon Corvairs were built on the same unibody as other sedan Corvairs with a 108 in. wheelbase. Standard transmission was a 3 speed manually shifted transaxle.

In 1961 the Lakewood was available in base form as part of the ''Corvair Lakewood 500'' and an "upscale" trim form as the ''Lakewood 700''. In 1962 the base trim level was called ''Corvair Deluxe series 700'' and the top-of-the line model was the ''Corvair Monza series 900''. The Series 900's powertrain "uni-pak" was the same as all Corvairs.  A commonly ordered option on Corvair Station Wagons was the 84&amp;nbsp;bhp engine connected to a 2 speed [[Powerglide]] automatic transaxle.

Production of the Corvair Station Wagon ended in the 1st quarter of calendar year 1962 to make way for the new Monza Convertible body style. In two years 32,120 Station Wagons were made. Only 2,362 of them (model year 1962 only) were Monza Station Wagon models. The 1961 Lakewood 700 was most popular with 20,451 made (64% of all Station Wagons produced)

All 1961 Corvairs came in one of 15 available paint colors. All 1961 Station Wagons had a rubber floor covering with the ''700'' series having it color keyed to the interior. 
The ''Monza 900'' series was available with optional (extra cost) bucket seats. The upscale Monza series included carpeting and bright trim in the interior. 
Many options were available for the Station Wagon models as they were for the Corvair Sedan.  This included 4 speed transmission, higher HP engine, and comfort and convenience options as well.

The '''1957 Chevrolet''' is a car which was introduced by [[Chevrolet]] in September 1956 for the 1957 model year. It was available in three series models: the upscale [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]], the mid-range [[Chevrolet 210|Two-Ten]], and the [[Chevrolet 150|One-Fifty]]. A two-door station wagon, the [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]], was produced as a Bel Air model. An upscale trim option called the [[Chevrolet Delray|Delray]] was available for Two-Ten 2-door sedans. It is a popular and sought after [[classic car]]. These vehicles are often restored to their original condition and sometimes modified. The car's image has been frequently used in toys, [[graphics]], music, movies, and television. The '' '57 Chevy'', as it is often known, is an ''auto icon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.petroliatopic.com/2014/02/25/57-chevys-iconic-popularity-has-endured | title='57 Chevy's iconic popularity has endured | publisher=The Petrolia Topic | date=February 25, 2014 | accessdate=June 6, 2014 | author=Epp, Peter | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529103348/http://www.petroliatopic.com/2014/02/25/57-chevys-iconic-popularity-has-endured | archive-date=May 29, 2014 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially, General Motors executives wanted an entirely new car for 1957, but production delays necessitated the 1955–56 design for one more year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classic-car-history.com/1957-chevy-history.htm|title=1957 Chevy History|first=Mark|last=Trotta|website=www.classic-car-history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Cole]], chief engineer for Chevrolet, dictated a series of changes that significantly increased the cost of the car. These changes included a new dashboard, sealed cowl, and the relocation of air ducts to the headlight pods, which resulted in the distinctive chrome headlight that helped make the '57 Chevrolet a classic. Fourteen-inch wheels replaced the fifteen-inch wheels from previous years to give the car a lower stance, and a wide [[grille]] was used to give the car a wider look from the front. The now famous '57 Chevrolet [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] were designed to duplicate the wide look in the rear. Bel Air models, though maintaining the same chassis, powertrains, and body, were given upscale gold trim: the mesh grille insert and front fender chevrons, as well as the "Chevrolet" script on the hood and trunk, were all rendered in anodized gold. The 1957 Chevrolets did not have an oil pressure gauge or a voltmeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1957%20Chevrolet%20Manual-02.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The base engine was an inline 6-cylinder called the Blue Flame Six. The engine was smoother running than the V-8. Carburetion came from a single one-barrel [[carburetor]].

=== "Tri-Five" 1955–1957 V8===
The 1955 model year Chevrolet introduced its now-famous [[small-block]] V-8&amp;nbsp;— the first V-8 available in a Chevrolet since 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1918_Chevrolet/1918_Chevrolet_V8_Brochure/1918%20Chevrolet%20V8-05.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1918_Chevrolet/1918_Chevrolet_V8_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a displacement of {{convert|265|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}. Prior to 1955, Chevrolet offered a {{convert|235|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} displacement in-line 6-cylinder engine only. The 1955 model, like its engine, was all new. The "shoebox" design, so named because it was the first Chevrolet to feature streamlined rear fenders, was a watershed for Chevrolet. The lightweight car, coupled with a powerful overhead valve V-8, became a showroom draw, but also thrust the company into the arena of competitive motorsports. 1955 Chevrolets went on to dominate drag racing and became a formidable force in circle track racing. In 1956, the design was lengthened somewhat in front and given a more squarish treatment; under the hood, engine power increased and a [[Chevrolet Corvette]] engine was available for the first time in a full-size passenger car.  In 1957, the V-shaped trim on the tail fins was filled with a ribbed aluminum insert exclusive to the Bel Air's upgraded trim level.  The fuel-injected engine represented the first time that an internal combustion gasoline engine in a passenger car reached an advertised one horsepower for each cubic inch benchmark, although the [[Chrysler 300B]] beat that by a year in its 355-horsepower, 354 c.i.d dual-carburetored engine, and the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint was introduced a year earlier than that (1954), with a 79 cubic inch (1290cc) engine that produced 80&amp;nbsp;hp. In NASCAR racing the 283 with its increased horsepower gave the '57 a dramatic advantage over the smaller 265 V8 the '55 and '56 had. NASCAR held the competition, especially the '55–'57 Chevrolet to a cubic inch restriction because of all the races the '57s were winning. This restriction stayed with the '55–'57 until they were grandfathered out of the lower NASCAR divisions in the 1970s as the '57 was still beating virtually all in their class.

===Body styles===
Body choices for 1957 included:

* 2- and 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedans]] (identified by the "posts" between door windows)
* 2-door "Sport Coupe" (a two-door [[hardtop]] - the car has no post between the front and back window when the windows are lowered)
* "Sport Sedan" (a 4-door [[hardtop]])
* 2-door Utility Sedan, a two-door sedan with a package shelf instead of a rear seat
* Delray "Club Coupe", which was a Two-Ten model 2-door sedan with a deluxe interior
* The top-of-the-line 2-door Bel Air Nomad [[station wagon]] with a sloped pillar behind the hardtop door and sliding windows at the rear seat
* The basic 2-door Handyman station wagon with an upright sedan [[Pillar (car)|B-pillar]] and a C-pillar, where the four-door wagons have one, available only in One-Fifty and Two-Ten trims. 
* 4-door, six-passenger station wagon
* 4-door, nine-passenger station wagon (both called Townsman in the One-Fifty series and Beauville for the Bel Air version)
* [[Convertible (car)|Convertible]]

Unlike most competitors, the Chevrolet 4-door hardtop featured a reinforced rear roof structure that gave the car added rigidity and a unique appearance in [[silhouette]]. The 1957 Chevrolet was called by some a "Baby Cadillac", because of many styling cues similar to Cadillacs of the time.  V8-optioned cars got a large "V" under the Chevrolet script on the hood and trunk lid; the "V: was gold for the Bel Air trim level, and silver-colored chrome for the 210 and 150 trim levels. 

The 2-door Bel Air Nomad station wagon had its own distinctive styling, mainly in the roof line and rear deck.

===Engines===
For 1957 there were four standard engine options, a {{convert|235.5|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} inline 6-cylinder producing {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|265|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} V8 "Turbo-Fire" producing {{Convert|162|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and two {{convert|283|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} V8s: a "Turbo-Fire" twin-barrel carburetor producing {{Convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a "Super "Turbo-Fire" four-barrel carburetor developing {{Convert|220|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Car Brochures|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1957%20Chevrolet%20Manual-31.html|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To help mechanics distinguish the 265|cu in V8 engine from the red 1956 and 1955 265|cu in V8 engines and the orange 1957|283|cuin| V8s, the early 1957 265|cu in V8 engines with manual transmissions were painted a bright yellow-green chartreuse. After November 1956, the 1957 265|cu in V8 engines were painted the same orange as the 1957|283|cuin| V8s.

Another optional engine was offered with two four barrel carburetors, the legendary "Duntov" cam and solid lifters.  This engine produced 270&amp;nbsp;hp.  1957 was the first year that Chevrolet ever offered [[fuel injection]] as an option. A {{convert|283|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} engine fitted with solid lifters, the "Duntov" cam and fuel injection was rated at {{Convert|283|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and cost $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1955-1957-chevrolet-nomad1.htm|title=1955, 1956, 1957 Chevrolet Nomad|date=November 27, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. "Kelly"|title=American Cars, 1946–1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in history that a General Motors vehicle achieved 1-hp-per-cu-in in a production vehicle. Fuel injection continued as an option throughout the early 1960s. However, most mechanics of the time didn't have the experience to keep the units running properly. This prompted most buyers to opt for conventional carburetion.

In a 1957 survey of owners, Popular Mechanics reported that 16.9% of owners complained about the fuel economy, while 34.4% wanted fuel injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0|title=Popular Mechanics - Google Books|work=Popular Mechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Options===

There were many options available, most of which were designed to make the car more comfortable and luxurious. Air conditioning was offered though rarely ordered, as was a padded dash. Power steering and power brakes were available, as well as a signal-seeking AM&lt;ref name="Flory, Jr. 2008"/&gt; radio and power antenna. Power windows and power seats were also available. A rear speaker could be purchased which required a separate volume knob to be installed in the dashboard, beside the radio&amp;nbsp;— this rear speaker was touted as providing "surround" sound. An "Autronic eye" was offered; it was a device that bolted onto the dashboard and sensed the light from oncoming traffic, dimming the headlights automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Accessories/1957%20Chevrolet%20Acc%20Booklet-01.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Accessories |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IkU1UjnG6QC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=1957+chevrolet&amp;q=1957+chevrolet|title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet, 1912-2003: 90 Years of History, Photos, Technical Data and Pricing|first=John|last=Gunnell|date=November 18, 2011|publisher=Krause Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unique option was an electronic shaver, connected to the dashboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet_Accessories/1956%20Chevrolet%20Acc-27.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet/1956_Chevrolet_Accessories |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The '57 radio used tubes that required only 12 volts of plate voltage and a transistor for the output stage. This lowered the power drain on the battery to an insignificant amount when the engine was off. Playing the radio with conventional tubes for extended periods occasionally drained the battery to the extent that it could not start the car.
The clock was electrically self-wound and moving the hands to correct the time resulted in actually regulating the going rate. After a few corrections, the clock was remarkably accurate.

Another dashboard-mounted item was the traffic-light viewer, a ribbed plastic visor that was installed just above the speedometer. Because the roof extends so far forward of the driver, it is hard to see overhead traffic lights. The traffic light viewer captured the reflection of overhead traffic lights so that the driver didn't have to lean forward to see past the edge of the roof. A/C was also an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1957%20Chevrolet%20Manual-18.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Chevrolet started to add safety features such as "crash proof door locks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Brochure-Cdn/1957%20Chevrolet%20%20Cdn%20-22.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Brochure-Cdn |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "(first added in 1956), padded dash boards, safety-styled steering wheel with a recessed hub&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Brochure_2/1957%20Chevrolet%20Brochure-a05.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Brochure_2 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though not as much as Ford's), seat belts(also first in 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://56classicchevy.com/accessories.html |title=1956 Classic Chevrolet – Accessories |publisher=56classicchevy.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and shoulder harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://57classicchevy.com/accessories.html |title=1957 Classic Chevrolet – Accessories |publisher=57classicchevy.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975|publisher=krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Ford, Chevrolet did not promote these safety features heavily.

1957 was also Chevrolet's first offering of a turbine transmission, known as the [[Turboglide]]. It was a design concept that Buick had developed with their [[Dynaflow]] transmission. However, due to a reliability reputation caused by its complexity, most automatic transmission buyers shunned the Turboglide in favor of the two-speed [[Powerglide]] that had been offered since 1950.  At the time the Turboglide casing was the largest cast aluminum component ever put into mass production, but it never recovered from the reputation in 1957 and the option was discontinued in 1961. Manual transmissions were limited to three-speed, column shifted units (with [[synchromesh]] in second and third gear only). The Powerglide's shifter went '''P N D L R''' while the Turboglide's was '''P R N D Hr''' (although the 'Hr' was changed early in the production series to 'Gr'-Grade Retarder because of drivers' mistaken belief that 'Hr' meant High Range instead of the correct Hill Retarder.)  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1957%20Chevrolet%20Manual-11.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1957%20Chevrolet%20Manual-13.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An overdrive unit was available as an option on the three speed manually shifted transmission cars. Starting at the end of May 1957, a four speed manual transmission was also offered at an over-the-counter price of $188.00 but no installation kit (shifter and linkage) was ever offered by Chevrolet and, while an owner may have jury-rigged an installation in their own car, there is no evidence that any dealer ever actually installed the transmission in any car in 1957. A '57 equipped with this transmission mated to the 270 horsepower engine and [[limited slip differential]] was the one to beat on the drag strip and street into the early 1960s.

=== Post-production popularity ===

From a numbers standpoint, the '57 Chevrolet wasn't as popular as General Motors had hoped.  Despite its popularity, rival [[Ford]] outsold Chevrolet for the 1957 model year for the first time since 1935. The main cause of the sales shift to Ford was that the '57 Chevrolet had tubeless tires, the first car to have them. This scared away sales to Ford as many people did not initially trust the new tubeless design. Also Ford's introduction of an all-new body styling that was longer, lower, and wider than the previous year's offerings helped Ford sales.&lt;ref name="1957Ford.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1957ford.com/history/index.html |title=1957Ford.com – History |publisher=1957Ford.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223083319/http://1957ford.com/history/index.html |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the 1957 Ford&amp;nbsp;— with the exception of the rare retractable hardtop model&amp;nbsp;— is not nearly as prized by collectors today as the 1957 Chevrolet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the '57 Chevrolet was a popular [[used car]] and highly prized "street machine" or [[hot rod]] in 1957 terms. It was the final year of the "shoebox" Chevrolet, as 1958 saw the introduction of a much larger and heavier "X" framed Chevrolet. The ideal size of the '57, combined with its relatively light weight compared to newer full-sized cars, made it a favorite among drag racers. The engine bay was big enough to fit GM's [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|big-block engines]], first introduced in 1958 and popularized in the 1960s by the [[Beach Boys]] in the song "[[409 (song)|409]]". The relatively simple mechanical attributes of the car made it easy to maintain, customize, and upgrade with components such as [[disc brakes]] and air conditioning.

The big block, however, was not what put the '57 on the map on the street scene; it was the introduction of the low-priced small-block, 365-horsepower [[GM Small-Block engine#327|327]] in 1962 that was the blockbuster that made both the '55 and '57 Chevrolet able to beat the Ford hotrods with their flathead V8s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This was a major turning point in American hot rodding: Chevrolet had claimed the street scene from Ford. 
The '57 Chevrolet also won 49 Grand National "cup" [[NASCAR]] races (the most of any car in NASCAR history), won the Southern 500 (in [[1957 Southern 500|1957]], [[1958 Southern 500|1958]], and [[1959 Southern 500|1959]]); becoming the only car to win the 500 three times. The earliest victory for a '57 Chevrolet in a titled NASCAR Grand National Series race was the [[1957 Virginia 500]].

The '57 also won 26 NASCAR "convertible races," more than any make, and won all three possible driver's championships. The first in convertible class and winning car in the 1959 Daytona 500 was a '57 driven by Joe Lee Johnson. The convertibles started on the outside row and were approximately ten miles an hour slower than the hardtops and sedans because of their aerodynamics. No one figured that a convertible would win the race and they didn't but wonder who was driving the top finishing convertible.
 
The [[GM Small-Block engine#283|283]] engine placed from the factory behind the centerline of the front wheels made the '57 a superior handling car on the short tracks and the dirt tracks as well. This mechanical advantage, coupled with the high revving and reliable 283, earned the '57 the nickname "king of the short tracks"{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} With the fuel injected 283, the One-Fifty model two door sedan version, called the "black widow," was the first car outlawed (and quickly so) by NASCAR as it proved almost unbeatable on virtually all the NASCAR tracks in early 1957. After the '57 was grandfathered out from the now "cup" division in 1960 and relegated to the lower local track sportsman divisions, they were still the car to beat for years. The '57s subsequently were used up in stock car racing at a very high rate. Surprisingly enough, the '57 Chevrolet also won a disproportionate amount of [[demolition derby|demolition derbies]] as well:  With the radiator set back from the grille, the car was difficult to disable. The additional advantage of having the last double lined trunk, coupled with a strong frame, made it a surprisingly common winner in the demolition derbies during the late 1960s and early 1970s. By the 1970s, the '57 Chevrolet became a collector car.

Companies such as Danchuk Manufacturing, Inc. and Classic Chevy Club International began selling reproduction and restoration parts. In the early 1990s, the value of a meticulously restored '57 Chevrolet convertible was as high as $100,000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Although those peaks gave way significantly after 1992, the '57 Chevrolet has held its value and is now poised to exceed the previous peak.

Although restored original examples are increasingly rare, modern customizers and restorers are creating fast, powerful, ultra-modern hot rods that are winning the '57 Chevy a whole new generation of fans. As original cars become harder to find, fiberglass and all-steel reproductions (EMI in Detroit, Michigan was the first to build restoration bodies using original firewalls with VIN numbers - the steel reproduction bodyshells are manufactured by Real Deal Steel in Sanford, Florida, using reproduction sheetmetal) are making it possible for future generations to enjoy the '57 Chevrolet.

The '''Chevrolet Venture''' is a [[minivan]] produced by [[General Motors]] for the 1997 to 2005 model years. The Chevrolet Venture, along with most of its General Motors minivan siblings, was built at GM's Doraville, Georgia, assembly plant.

==Use of name==
[[File:Chevrolet Venture Concept at 1988 Teamwork and Technology.jpg|275px|thumb|left|The original Chevrolet Venture sedan in 1988.]]
The Venture name was first used on a 1988 Chevrolet concept car, in this case a full-sized four-door sedan more aerodynamic than the 1991-1996 [[Chevrolet Caprice]].

==History==
[[File:1997-2000 Chevrolet Venture SWB 3-Door.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1997-2000 Chevrolet Venture SWB]]
[[File:2002 Chevrolet Venture LS (3904951666) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|200px|2001-2005 Chevrolet Venture LS]]
The Venture was introduced in 1996 for the 1997 model year as a replacement for the radically styled [[Chevrolet Lumina APV|Lumina APV]]. In the [[United States]], it was also sold as the [[Oldsmobile Silhouette]] and the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]], which was later renamed as the [[Pontiac Montana]] for 1999 (2000 in [[Canada]]).  The Venture came in three trim levels, the ''base'', ''LS'', and ''LT''. The base models of the Venture were short wheelbase models which came equipped with cloth upholstery, front bucket seats with fixed head restraints, a 2nd-row 2-passenger bench seat, and steel wheels. The ''LS'' came in both short and long wheelbases, and offered aluminum wheels, a varied seating configuration, adjustable head restraints, side airbags, power windows (optional on the base models), and a remote keyless entry system. The ''LT'' model was an upscale of the ''LS'' and was exclusively a long wheelbase model and offered a power driver seat (optional on the base and ''LS'' models), optional leather seats, a roof rack (optional on the base and ''LS'' models), and a driver side sliding door (optional on the base and ''LS'' models from 1997–1999). The anti-lock brakes were standard on all Ventures from 1996–2002, but became optional on the base models later on. 

The Venture and its siblings were powered by GM's 3.4 L [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LA1|LA1]] [[V6]], rated at {{Convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. After 1999, the engine was slightly redesigned to produce an extra {{Convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, for a total of {{Convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and the alarm system for seatbelts, door ajar, low fuel, etc. have been changed.  All Ventures used a four-speed [[automatic transmission]]. The Venture was one of the few minivans to have an 8-passenger seating configuration as an option when most minivans seated up to 7 passengers. In 2000, the driver side sliding door became standard on all trim levels, when the passenger side only sliding door models of minivans have rapidly fallen out of favor since the 1996 models of Chrysler minivans. The exterior was refreshed in 2001, a back-up alarm was added to indicate possible obstacles behind the vehicle, and [[all-wheel drive]] was introduced in 2002. Also for 2002 was a new steering wheel equivalent to the 2000-2005 [[Chevrolet Impala]], replacing the steering wheel equivalent to the 1995-2001 [[Chevrolet Lumina]]. New for this generation, [[cabin air filter]]s were installed, and the filters can be accessed from behind an access panel easily accessed from inside the glove compartment. 

The optional 2-3-2 seating configuration was dropped in favor of the more conventional 2-2-3 and 2-3-3 seating configurations. The 2-3-3 was the standard for the Chinese-made Buick GL8, and a 10-seats arranged in a 3-4-3 configuration was used in a Chinese-made version of the Chevrolet Venture for export to the Philippines and Latin America (where it sold alongside the U.S. Venture) where 10-seaters are favored with lower taxes. Reviews and sales were generally lukewarm, especially about the relatively narrow cabin due to being designed for European roads. The vans came in both short and long wheelbases, and all-wheel drive versions like the [[Chrysler minivans]]. The third row bench seat was designed to fold flat (introduced for 2001 and available on ''LS'' and ''Warner Bros.'' models), but forming a higher floor unlike the [[Honda]], [[Mazda]] and [[Nissan]] minivans that folded into a well behind the third row.

The Venture was replaced after 2005 by the [[Chevrolet Uplander]], which was essentially a facelift with one long wheelbase configuration, and a longer nose which served chiefly to improve crush distance and styling more like an SUV. Only the long-wheelbase Venture was sold for 2005 in the US but the short-wheelbase was still offered in Canada. Production of the Chevy Venture ended on June 24, 2005.

==Model year changes==
*1997 model year-Introduction of the ''base'' model in early 1997. The 1997-1999 Ventures were their new version. The LS model is also introduced.
*1998 model year-power sliding doors and available OnStar were options on all models.
*1999 model year-A new Warner Bros. Edition is also introduced for the 1999 model year on the Venture, along with a built-in TV system with a DVD-player and a built-in VCR system as well.
*2000 model year-
*2001 model year (refresh)-OnStar is now a standard feature on the Venture. The Venture had also received a mid-cycle refresh with a redesigned front grille that matches the Chevrolet Impala's front grille. The 2001 Venture had also received a redesigned new steering wheel.
*2003 model year-More equipment packages were introduced for 2003. The Venture is now available with XM Satellite Radio.
*2004 model year-The LT trim is discontinued.
*2005 model year-This is the last year for the Venture. The Venture is unchanged. The short-wheelbase version of the Venture is now only available to rental car companies and to the fleet-market for the 2005 model year. The Venture is replaced with the Uplander.

==Warner Bros. Edition==
A [[Warner Bros.]] edition, introduced in 1999, included leather and cloth seats, standard built–in child restraints, Warner Bros. badging with [[Bugs Bunny]] leaning on the Warner Bros. Shield  logo, and a [[DVD]] entertainment system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When Bugs Bunny &amp; the Chevy Venture Warner Bros. Edition Made Minivans Cool |url=https://thenewswheel.com/when-bugs-bunny-the-chevy-venture-warner-bros-edition-made-minivans-cool/ |website=The NewsWheel |accessdate=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; a novelty at the time (however, some editions included a VHS player instead). 

The Warner Bros. edition was a very rare model that was only produced for the 2000–2003 model years and the only model to come with a monochromatic exterior (like its Silhouette twin) as opposed to black accents that the other Ventures offered and this model only came in four colors: Blue, red, silver, and black. These models included VHS and DVD compilations of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', girls pajamas, a cooler with can holders, a special keychain, and a beach blanket, as an amenity kit.

==Safety==
The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) gave the 1997 Chevrolet Venture a rating of four stars out of five in a head-on collision, and five stars in the side-impact collision. Tests on subsequent model years yielded results of four stars in most categories, and three or five stars in others. The NHTSA does not conduct offset frontal crash tests.

[[File:1997 Pontiac Trans Sport SE IIHS.jpg|thumb|left|The 1997 [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] crash-tested by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]]]

The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] tested the [[Pontiac Trans Sport]] (a twin of the Venture) in late 1996, and it received a "Poor" rating in the 40 MPH offset frontal crash test for poor structural performance, and was ranked as the "Worst Performing Vehicle" of all the vehicles tested, with test results indicating a high risk of serious injury or fatality. This result affected both the Venture's and the [[Oldsmobile Silhouette|Silhouette's]] safety reputations (as well as the Pontiac Montana/Trans Sport).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=67 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Pontiac Trans Sport/Montana |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2005-09-19 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Europe]]an twin, the [[Opel Sintra]], did badly in the [[EuroNCAP]]'s crash tests as well, with only two stars (out of five).

The '''Chevrolet Monza''' is a [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] automobile produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1975–1980 [[model year]]s. The Monza is based on the [[Chevrolet Vega]], sharing its [[wheelbase]], width and 140-CID (2,300 cc) [[inline-four]] engine. The 1975 Monza 2+2 was designed to accommodate the GM-[[Wankel engine|Wankel]] rotary engine, but due to mediocre fuel-economy and emissions-compliance issues the engine was cancelled, and a fuel-efficient, 4.3-liter &amp; 5.7-liter V8 engine option was substituted.&lt;ref name= MTrend53&gt;{{cite journal| work= [[Motor Trend]]| date= March 1975| title= [Unknown]| publisher=| volume= 29| number= 3| page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was also used for the Latin-American version of the [[Opel Ascona#C|Opel Ascona C]].

The Monza 2+2 and Monza Towne Coupe competed with the [[Ford Mustang II]] and other sporty coupes.&lt;ref name="h-body.org"&gt;h-body.org&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors' [[GM H platform (RWD)|H-body]] variants, the [[Buick Skyhawk]] and [[Oldsmobile Starfire]], were produced using the Monza 2+2's body with grille and trim variations and [[Buick]]'s 3.8 liter [[V6 engine]]. The [[Pontiac Sunbird]] variant was introduced the following model year, eventually offered in both Monza [[body styles]]. The Monza nameplate originated in mid-1960 for the sport version of the [[Chevrolet Corvair]].

==History==

===Origin===

The Monza 2+2 debuted as a single-model 2+2 hatchback. The Monza is {{convert|4|in|mm}} longer and weighs {{cvt|180|lb}} more than the Vega from which it is derived.&lt;ref name="1975 Chevrolet Monza brochure"&gt;{{cite book| title= 1975 Chevrolet Monza| type= brochure| publisher= Chevrolet | year= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors' [[John DeLorean]] nicknamed it the "Italian Vega", citing styling with a strong resemblance to the [[Ferrari 365 GTC/4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wright| first= J. Patrick| title= On a Clear Day you Can See General Motors: John Z. DeLorean's Look Inside the Automotive Giant| location= New York| publisher= Smithmark Publishing| year= 1979 |isbn= 0-9603562-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM had planned to introduce the GM [[Wankel engine|Wankel]] rotary engine (licensed from [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]]) in the Monza's 1975 model. Rotary issues included mediocre fuel economy compounded at a time of comparatively high fuel prices following the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of 1973, and GM canceled the engine. Thus, the 1975 Chevrolet Monza was launched carrying a conventional piston engine instead.

===Overview===
The 1975 Monza 2+2 houses its once-newly approved rectangular headlights and a slot-style grille in a slanted nose made of resilient [[polyurethane]]. The side window louvers are functional, part of the flow-through ventilation system. The Monza 2+2's two-door [[hatchback]] body style is shared with the [[Oldsmobile Starfire]] and [[Buick Skyhawk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work= [[Motor Trend]]| date= September 1974| title= [Unknown]| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard Monza engine was the Vega aluminum-block [[GM 2300 engine|140 CID (2.3 liter)]] [[inline-four]] engine with a single barrel [[carburetor]]  that generates {{convert|78|hp}} at 4,200 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. Optional was the two-barrel carburetor version that generated {{convert|87|hp}} at 4,400 rpm.&lt;ref name="1975 Chevrolet Monza brochure"/&gt; Chevrolet's new 4.3 liter (262 cid) V8 engine was optional. The smallest V8 ever offered by Chevrolet, it featured a Rochester two-barrel carburetor and generated {{convert|110|hp}} at 3,600 rpm.  For 1975 only, Monzas sold in California and high altitude areas met the stricter emissions requirement by substituting a version of the 5.7 liter (350 cid) [[V8 engine]] with a two-barrel carburetor tuned to just {{cvt|125|hp|kW|0}}. The Monza 2+2 and its Buick and Oldsmobile variants feature GM's first use of a torque arm rear suspension, also adopted for the 1975 [[Chevrolet Cosworth Vega|Cosworth Vega]] introduced mid-1975, and later, all 1976–1977 Vegas and [[Pontiac Astre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= 1975 Chevrolet Monza|type= brochure| date= | publisher= Chevrolet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= 1975 Chevrolet Cosworth Vega| type= brochure| date= | publisher= Chevrolet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1976 &amp; 1977 Chevrolet Vega &amp; Pontiac Astre brochures&lt;/ref&gt; The basic design was also incorporated into GM's third and fourth generation F-bodies, the [[Chevrolet Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird]].

In April 1975, the Monza Towne Coupe was introduced — a [[notchback]] body-style with a conventional trunk featuring different sheetmetal than the 2+2 hatchback, but sharing its windshield and front fenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= 1975 Chevrolet Monza| type= brochure| date= March 1975| publisher= Chevrolet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It features single round [[headlamps]], instead of the dual rectangular headlamps on the 2+2.  The Towne Coupe was offered in response to the sales success of the [[Ford Mustang II]] notchback coupe and its luxury version, the Mustang II Ghia. The Towne Coupe is {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} shorter and {{convert|135|lb|kg}} lighter than the 2+2 and has slightly more rear head room.

A lower priced "S" version of the 2+2 hatchback was introduced mid-year. It featured as standard the Vega one-barrel engine with a three-speed [[manual transmission]]. The sport suspension, full console, sport steering wheel, day/night rear-view mirror and wheel opening moldings were deleted on the "S". The Chevrolet Monza 2+2 won ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]] award for 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work= Motor Trend| date= February 1975| title= Car of the Year| publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model year changes===
The 1976 {{cvt|140|cuin}} four-cylinder engine, as used in the Vega, got some refinements. Named "Dura-built 140", it features quieter hydraulic lifters eliminating valve adjustments. The basic four developed 70 horsepower, but two-barrel carburetion increased the rating to 84. The 1976 model was the introduction of Chevrolet's new 5.0 liter (305 CID) V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor generating {{convert|140|hp}} at 3,800 rpm, but only for California and high-altitude Monza customers, and replaced the 5.7 liter (350 CID) V8. The 262 V8 was again the optional engine in 49 states. A mid-year option for the 1976 model year was a sport front end available for the Towne Coupe, which featured the 2+2's polyurethane front end and quad headlamps. The Monza Spyder equipment package was introduced in 1976 for both the 2+2 hatchback and Towne Coupe. It featured a two-barrel carburetor version of the four-cylinder engine as standard, a floor console, sport steering wheel, F41 suspension with larger front and rear stabilizer bars, and special shock absorbers. This equipment had been standard on the original 1975 2+2 (excluding the mid-year "S" model).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/North-America/Chev/1976-Chevrolet/1976-Chevrolet-Monza-Brochure|title=1976 Chevrolet Monza brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Old Car Brochures|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1977 Monza was highlighted by two new Spyder option packages available only for the 2+2 hatchback, one being a $274 Z01 performance equipment package and the other an additional $199 Z02 appearance package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/North-America/Chev/1977-Chevrolet/1977-Chevrolet-Monza-Brochure|title=1977 Chevrolet Monza brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Old Car Brochures|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; An {{convert|84|hp}} four-cylinder engine was standard, but Monzas could be ordered with a {{convert|145|hp}} {{cvt|305|cuin|l|sigfig=2}} V8 instead. The Monza dashboard contained round gauges in a brushed-aluminum instrument panel. The Towne Coupe Cabriolet was deleted, but a half-vinyl roof and opera windows could still be ordered.

The Monza “Mirage” was a one-year only (1977) sporty body modification package produced by Michigan Auto Techniques (MAT), an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] company contracted by GM; the Mirage was painted white, with red and blue racing stripes along the length of the car. It also featured flared body panels and a special airdam and spoiler. The vehicles were built in GM's St. Therese plant, and sent to MAT for modification, after which MAT would ship completed cars to the dealer. There were approximately 4,097 1977 Mirages made by MAT,&lt;ref name="h-body.org"&gt;h-body.org&lt;/ref&gt; but there were also Mirages created by Chevrolet dealerships, as the body add-ons and stripes were available through the dealer parts department. The 5.0 liter (305 CID) engine was the only V8 option for the 1977 model year. The standard Vega 2.3 aluminum-block engine was discontinued at the end of the model year, replaced with the Pontiac 2.5 "Iron Duke".

The 1978 Monza line expanded to include [[badge engineering|rebadged]] holdovers from the Vega line, which ended production after the 1977 model year. Chevy grafted a new Monza front end onto the previous Vega hatchback and wagon body-styles. The [[Chevrolet Vega#1978–1979|Monza "S"]], marketed as the Monza price leader, used the Vega hatchback body. With production of only 2,000 units, it was speculated that this was simply an effort to use up a stock of leftover 1977 Vega bodies. The Monza wagon was also offered in an estate wood-trimmed version, using the Vega wagon body. The 1978 Monza line gained a new base coupe and 2+2 hatchback with round headlights in an upright front end with a crossbar grille and new tri-colored taillamps. The base 2+2 hatchback also used a new blunt rear taillamp panel incorporating the license plate mount and a conventional rear bumper. The sport 2+2 hatchback and sport notchback used a modified version of the previous quad rectangular headlamps, now above a full-width open-slot grill. The 2.5 liter (151 CID) inline-four "Iron Duke" was standard for 1978, replacing the Vega's inline-four engine. Engine options were a Buick-designed 3.2 liter (196 CID) V6 engine with a two-barrel carburetor that produced {{convert|90|hp}} at 3,600 rpm.  Replacing the 3.2 liter V6 in California and high-altitude areas was Buick's 3.8 liter (231 CID) {{cvt|105|hp}} V6 engine. Four-cylinder engines and the 3.2 liter V6 were not available in high-altitude areas. The {{cvt|145|hp}} 305 cubic-inch V8 remained optional in all but the "S" hatchback and wagon models. Discontinued at the end of the 1978 model year were the S hatchback, Towne Coupe sport option and the estate version of the wagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= 1978 Chevrolet Monza| type= brochure| publisher= Chevrolet | date= January 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 Chevrolet Monza lineup was trimmed to four models.  Added standard equipment for 1979 included an AM radio, tinted glass, bodyside moldings, and sport steering wheel. Only the 2+2 sport hatchback kept the sloped Euro-look front end; others had a freshened grille. A more-potent standard {{convert|151|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} four-cylinder with a redesigned cross-flow cylinder head and two-barrel carburetor developed 90-horsepower — five more than in 1978. Three optional engines were available: the {{cvt|105|hp}} {{convert|196|cuin|l}} V6, {{cvt|115|hp}} 231 V6, and {{cvt|130|hp}} 305 V8. The Spyder performance package cost $164 and the Spyder appearance package added $231. All Monzas had a color-keyed instrument panel, and all except the base coupe had a center console, and corrosion protection was improved. Discontinued at the end of the 1979 model year were the Monza wagon, the {{cvt|196|cuin|l|sigfig=2}} V6 and the {{cvt|305|cuin|l|sigfig=2}} V8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= 1979 Chevrolet Monza| type= brochure| publisher= Chevrolet | year= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980 model year lineup consisted of a base 2+2 hatchback, notchback, and 2+2 sport hatchback; the 151-cubic-inch (2.5-liter) four-cylinder engine remained standard and the only engine option was the 3.8 liter (231 CID) Buick V6. Chevrolet decided to discontinue the Monza at the end of the 1980 model year and let base models of the [[Chevrolet Camaro]] and the new [[Chevrolet Citation]] X-11 hold the division's place sporty-coupe market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= 1980 Chevrolet Monza| type= brochure| publisher= Chevrolet | date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Spyder" nameplate had been used to designate the 1962–1964 Corvair turbocharged model. The "Spyder" name was introduced for the Chevrolet Monza in 1976. This package included performance equipment and some small appearance items.  The Monza Spyder equipment package was available on all 2+2 hatchbacks and Monza Towne Coupes (with the "sport equipment" package) with five-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-matic [[automatic transmission]]s.  The Spyder equipment package included a two-barrel, Dura-Built 2.3 litre engine, floor console unit, large front and rear stabilizer bars, special shock absorbers, steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires, wheel opening mouldings (chrome), day-night inside mirror, a sport steering wheel (two-spoke), a special instrumentation and "stitched" instrument panel pad with added wood-grain vinyl accents (standard on 2+2), distinctive "Spyder" identification (script fender emblems, steering wheel horn button insert) and Spyder front facia and rear-lock cover.

Chevrolet made extensive changes to the Spyder package including separate equipment and appearance packages with separate RPO codes found on the build sheet.  The Spyder equipment package was a regular production option (RPO) Z01, while the Spyder appearance package was RPO Z02.  The Spyder packages were available on Monza 2+2 sport hatchbacks.  Spyder decal colors were determined by the body color of the Monza ordered.  There were four color combinations for 1977.  For 1979, there were six combinations, which included a green and a blue color scheme.

;Z01 – Spyder equipment : BR70-13C Steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires, sport suspension, sport steering wheel (two-spoke), center console, inside day-night rearview mirror, Spyder identification, wheel opening moldings (available if the Z02 – Spyder appearance package was not ordered), dual tailpipe system and white lettered tires were available in 1979.

;Z02 – Spyder appearance : Black highlights on front, side and rear of body headlight openings, parking light openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and center pillar louvers, rear end panel – (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and rear end panel decals), body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel horn button insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings.  Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.

;Z29 – Spyder equipment package : BR70-13C steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires (with option for raised white lettering), sport suspension, black front and rear bumper rub strips, black headlights frames, black windshield, belt, side and rear window moldings (not available with black exterior), black painted body sill (also not available with black exterior), black door and center pillar louvers, black painted taillight frames, body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems on front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel (horn button insert), black sport mirrors (LH remote, RH manual), rear spoiler and body stripes with Spyder lettering outlined in accent body colour, Spyder hood decal, black painted Rally II wheels with bright trim rings and center caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Chevrolet Monza| type= brochure| publisher= Chevrolet | year= 1976–1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stillborn Wankel engine===
[[File:'74 GM Rotary engine.jpg|thumb|200px|1974 Vega RC2-206 Wankel]]
In November 1970, GM paid $50 million for initial licenses to produce the [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]], and GM president Ed Cole projected its release in three years. The GM Wankel was initially targeted for an October 1973 introduction as a 1974 Vega option. The [[General Motors Rotary Combustion Engine]] (GMRCE) had two rotors displacing {{convert|206|cid|l|abbr=on}}, twin distributors and coils, and aluminum housing,&lt;ref name="Motor Trend, July 1973, p.52"&gt;{{cite journal| work= Motor Trend| date= July 1973| title= [Unknown]| publisher=| volume= | number= | page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unwilling to face the [[gas mileage]] criticism that [[Mazda]] withstood, GM felt it could meet 1975 [[emissions standards]] with the engine tuned to provide better mileage. Other refinements improved mileage to a remarkable 20 mpg, but with the fuel breakthrough came related side-effect problems — apex seal failures, as well as a rotor tip-seal problem.&lt;ref name="Motor Trend, July 1973, p.52"/&gt; By December 1973, it was clear the Wankel, now planned for the Monza 2+2, would not be ready for either production or emissions certification in time for the start of the 1975 model year.&lt;ref name= MTrend53 /&gt; and after paying another $10 million against its rotary licence fees, the company announced the first postponement. ''Motor Trend'' in April 1974 predicted the final outcome&lt;ref name= MTrend74&gt;{{cite journal| work= Motor Trend| date= April 1974| title= [Unknown]| publisher=| volume= | number= | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — On September 24, 1974, Cole postponed the Wankel engine ostensibly due to emissions difficulties and retired the same month. General Motors admitted fuel economy for the rotary was sub-standard and postponed production in favor of further development. [[Pete Estes]] succeeded Cole as GM's president and never showed any special interest in the Wankel or in the perpetuation of Cole's ideas. Estes had previously decided to let the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]], another Cole project, expire, well before the celebrated attacks of [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref name= MTrend74 /&gt;

=== End of the H-body ===
[[File:Chevrolet Monza.JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Monza]]
A total of 731,504 Monzas were produced in six model years.&lt;ref name="h-body.org"/&gt; General Motors replaced the [[rear-wheel drive]] (RWD) H-body Monza, Sunbird, Skyhawk, and Starfire in the spring of 1981 with a new, [[front-wheel drive]] (FWD), line-up, the [[GM J platform|J-car]] models: [[Chevrolet Cavalier]], [[Oldsmobile Firenza]], [[Buick Skyhawk]], [[Pontiac J2000]] and [[Cadillac Cimarron]], introduced as 1982 models. Because the forthcoming J-body cars were to be sold as 1982 models, there was a long production run of 1980 H-body models in order to provide sufficient inventory to carry dealers until the spring of 1981.

===United States===
[[File:DeKonMonza.jpg|thumb|Wynn's DeKon Monza]]
Chevrolet Monzas participated in the [[IMSA GT Series]] powered by [[Chevrolet Corvette]] engines. Chevrolet Monzas were the challengers in the new AAGT class. The class was designed to allow such cars to compete with the best GT cars in the world. The 1975 season was launched with the new cars that would compete with the dominating Porsche Carreras. A very liberal set of rules allowed some body panels to be retained – the windshield, the rear window and the roof. Everything else was built from scratch.

The IMSA racer and future triple [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] and dual [[Daytona 24 Hours]] winner [[Al Holbert]] saw the Monza's potential. By the end of the 1975 season, he had ordered a brand new car, built and prepared by Lee Dykstra and American-based Australian [[Trans-Am series|Trans-Am]] driver [[Horst Kwech]] at DeKon Engineering. Chassis No. 1008 was used starting the 1976 season. In 1976 and 1977, he was the IMSA Camel GT champion, beating [[Hans Stuck]], [[Brian Redman]] and [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]]. In Holbert's successful 1977 campaign he captured another Camel GT crown. However, it would be the last title for an American car. The Porsche 935s were becoming unbeatable right from the beginning of the 1978 season. However, the DeKon built Chevrolet Monza left its footprint on the IMSA Camel GT. They were quite unbeatable in 1976–1977. Chevrolet Monzas were seen in IMSA until 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Roadcarvin Magazine |url=http://www.roadcarvin.com/node/1041 |title=2007 Rolex Monterey Historic Races – 1977 DeKon Monza |publisher= |via= Roadcarvin.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Cord's original DeKon Monza is owned and vintage raced today by Ken Epsman, while Holbert's Monza has been found and is now undergoing restoration in northern California.

===Australia===
The Monza also saw success in Australia in the late 1970s and through the 1980s in the [[Australian Sports Sedan Championship]] (ASSC) (renamed the [[Australian GT Championship]] in 1982). [[Allan Moffat]] imported a DeKon Monza to Australia and won the [[1976 Australian Sports Sedan Championship|inaugural]] ASCC in 1976 (also driving a 'Cologne' [[Ford Capri|Ford Capri RS3100]]). In 1978, driver and prominent businessman [[Bob Jane]] imported a DeKon Monza, which was rebuilt and engineered by his chief mechanic Pat Purcell and driver-engineer Ron Harrop. Jane had some success with the car but it was at times plagued by poor reliability, and when he retired at the end of 1981 due to a back injury, he recruited touring car star driver [[Peter Brock]] to drive the car. Brock drove the 6.0L Monza in the [[1982 Australian GT Championship|1982]] and [[1983 Australian GT Championship|1983]] GT championships for Jane. A second Monza was built by Jane's team which was to have been raced in an IMSA street race in [[Miami]] in the early 1980s by Brock and Australia's {{f1|1980}} [[Formula One]] champion [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], though it was never raced in the USA.

In the 1982 championship, Brock came up against Jones in a well sorted, and slightly more powerful [[Porsche 935]] turbo. Brock and the Monza consistently matched the speed of Jones and the two put on some of the best racing ever seen in Australia, but reliability was still a problem with the car and results were not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0w33CRP0DI 1982 Australian GT Championship – Adelaide]&lt;/ref&gt; Brock was involved in a spectacular start line crash in round three of the 1983 championship at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] and the Monza was not seen again until the end of the year when Brock finished third in a GT/[[Australian Sports Car Championship|sports car]] invitation race as a support to the [[1983 Australian Grand Prix]]. After being rebuilt again by Purcell, Jane sold the car to former race driver Alan Browne, who put his [[1982 Bathurst 1000]] pole winning co-driver [[Allan Grice]] in it for the [[1984 Australian GT Championship|1984 GT championship]]. Grice and the Monza easily won the championship, winning all but one round. Grice, who had never gotten along with Purcell, was so impressed with the car after he first drove it that he  phoned Purcell to compliment him on what he felt was the best race car he had driven in his more than 20-year career.

The Monza was then prepared for the [[1984 Sandown 1000]], the final round of the [[1984 World Endurance Championship]]. Driving alongside renowned Ron Harrop and fellow touring car ace [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]], Grice qualified the {{Convert|650|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Monza a credible 18th (second in the invitation AC Class for Australian GT and [[Group A Sports Car]]s), and claimed the car lost nothing on the straights to the race winning [[Porsche 956]]B's, but lost time in the turns to the [[Ground effect (cars)|ground effects]] Porsches. Johnson later claimed that the car had more grunt from its 6.0L V8 than its handling deserved. They were eventually disqualified for receiving outside assistance from track marshals after completing 114 of the races 206 laps.

After 1984, Browne sold the Monza to veteran racer Bryan Thompson, who used it (along with his usual [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] powered, twin turbo [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class|Mercedes-Benz 450 SLC]]) to win the [[1985 Australian GT Championship]]. Thomson competed in the car over the next few years before rebuilding it over the 1988–89 off-season which also saw the Monza body shell replaced with that of a [[Toyota Supra#Mark III (1986–1992)|Toyota Supra]]. He then sold the car in 1990 to an unknown owner who then sold it to longtime Sydney-based sports car racer Des Wall. Wall was also successful with the Supra-bodied car and retained ownership of the car until his death in 2012. Now owned by his son, [[V8 Supercars]] driver [[David Wall (racing driver)|David Wall]] who it was reported had planned to restore the car to its Monza roots, though rumours have surfaced that he will keep the car as a Supra as a tribute to his late father.

Others to drive a Chevrolet Monza in Australian Sports Sedan / GT racing included: [[Briggs Motor Sport|John Briggs]] who raced a Monza built by K&amp;A Engineering in [[Adelaide]], Graeme Whincup (the father of multiple V8 Supercar and [[Bathurst 1000]] champion [[Jamie Whincup]]), who drove a Monza he built for racing in 1979, and Jeff Barnes.

The Monza was also a favourite of drivers in Australian [[Dirt Track Racing|speedway]] in both [[Australian Super Sedan Championship|super sedan]] and grand national racing during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Successful Monza drivers in speedway include Sydney Grand National driver Barry Graham.

The Vega first went on sale in Chevrolet dealerships on September 10, 1970 &lt;ref&gt;"First Peek At Chevy's Vega", ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 6, 1970, p49&lt;/ref&gt;.  Variants included the [[Chevrolet Cosworth Vega|Cosworth Vega]], a short-lived limited-production performance model, introduced in the spring of 1975.&lt;ref name="Cosworth"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robson |first1=Graham |title=Cosworth the Search for Power |publisher=Veloce Publishing |page=235 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7kJDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=cosworth+vega&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjp_rLasofoAhXLZc0KHfIIAKkQ6AEwAXoECAMQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=cosworth%20vega&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chevrolet and [[Pontiac]] divisions worked separately on small cars in the early and mid 1960s. [[Ed Cole]], GM's executive vice-president of operating staffs, working on his own small-car project with corporate engineering and design staffs, presented the program to GM's president in 1967. GM chose Cole's version over proposals from Chevrolet and Pontiac, and gave the car to Chevrolet to sell. Corporate management made the decisions to enter the small car market and to develop the car itself.
&lt;ref name="JDL"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=J. Patrick |title=On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors: John Z. DeLorean's Look Inside the Automotive Giant |date=1979 |publisher=Wright Enterprises |location=Grosse Pointe, Mich.|isbn=978-0-9603562-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|188-201}}

In 1968, GM chairman [[James Roche (General Motors)|James Roche]] announced GM would produce the new car in the U.S. in two years. Ed Cole was chief engineer and [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]], vice-president of design staff, was chief stylist. Cole wanted a world-beater in showrooms in 24 months.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Roche noted that GM had a team of "stylists, researchers and engineers" who had worked on the vehicle code named XP-877 for years.&lt;ref name="automotive1979"/&gt; [[John DeLorean]] later challenged this notion and stated that no prototypes or test properties had been built before Roche's announcement. Blueprints apparently did exist, however, they were an amalgam of competitive subcompact vehicles from overseas, including some that GM overseas operations produced. &lt;ref name="automotive1979"/&gt;
A GM design team was set up, headed by James G. Musser Jr., who had helped develop the [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevy II]], the [[Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)|Camaro]], the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet small-block V8 engines]], and the [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] transmission. Musser said, "This was the first vehicle where one person was in charge", and that his team "did the entire vehicle".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Collectible Automobile'', April 2000&lt;!--author, article name, &amp; p#?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As GM president, Cole oversaw the car's genesis and met the projected schedule.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

===Development 1968–1970===
The Vega was conceived in 1968 to utilize newly developed all-aluminum [[Die casting|die-cast]] engine block technology – the first sand-cast aluminum blocks had preceded the decision to build the car by two years. A relatively large displacement engine with good low- speed [[torque]] was decided on, with [[gear ratios]] for low engine rpm to achieve fuel economy. Engine testing totalled 6,000,000 miles. A pre-test engine was installed in a [[Fiat 124]] sedan for development of the aluminum block, while several [[Opel Kadett#Kadett B (1965–1973)|1968 Opel]] sedans were used for [[Drivetrain|drive train]] development&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Motor Trend'', February 1971 "Chevrolet Vega 2300 Car of the Year-Engineering".&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2018}}&lt;!--author &amp; article name?--&gt;

Chevrolet instituted a new management program, the car line management technique, to produce the all-new car in two years. The chief vehicle [[engineer]] had overall charge of the program. Fifty engineers, dedicated to the design of the entire car, were divided into groups: body, power train, chassis design, product assurance, and pleasability. The latter would check continuously on the vehicles on the assembly line, with computers in another program monitoring quality control of every vehicle built.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Fisher Body]] engineers and draftsmen moved in with the Vega personnel.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

In October 1968, there was one body style (the "11" style notchback sedan), one engine, one [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] (MB1 Torque-Drive manually shifted two-speed automatic), one base trim level, a [[bench seat]], molded rubber floor covering, no glove box or headliner and no [[car air conditioning|air-conditioning]] (ventilation was through the upper dash from the wiper plenum). As the market changed, so did the car in development.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

In December 1968, hatchback, wagon, and panel delivery styles were added; also floor-level ventilation, and an optional performance engine ("L-11" two-barrel) which, predicted as 20% of production, accounted for 75%.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} [[Bucket seats]] were standard. Hatchback and wagon received carpeting and headliners. Optional air conditioning, predicted as 10% of production, was actually selected 45% of the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:Vega clay model.jpg|thumb|XP-887 Hatchback clay model&lt;br&gt; Chevrolet studio final design, 1969]]

In February 1969,  [[Opel]] three- and four-speed transmissions (three-speed standard, others optional); [[Powerglide]] were added (now four transmissions); mechanical fuel pump replaced by in-tank [[Fuel pump#Electric pump|electric pump]] (making this the first GM product with an in tank fuel pump prior to the adoption of fuel injection); power steering option; base "11" style notchback trim upgraded to match hatchback and wagon carpet and headliner.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

In April 1969, the car gained gauge-pack cluster, HD [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], wider tires; adjustable seat back (45% of production); [[bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] restyled, lower valance panels added; swing-out quarter window option (10% of production).{{fact|date=August 2019}}

In July 1969, an electrically heated backlite option (10% of production); "GT" package, $325.00 extra (35% of production); bright window-frame and roof drip moldings added to hatchback and wagon.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

This is essentially how the car launched as a 1971 model. Production began on June 26, 1970. After the national GM strike (September to November 1970), bright roof drip moldings were added to the base "11" notchback, with moldings sent to dealers to update units already in the field.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

''Cars'' magazine said in 1974 that in the rush to introduce the car with other 1971 models, "[t]ests which should have been at the proving grounds were performed by customers, necessitating numerous piecemeal "fixes" by dealers. Chevrolet's "bright star" received an enduring black eye despite a continuing development program which eventually alleviated most of these initial shortcomings."&lt;ref name="Cars magazine April 1974"&gt;''Cars'' magazine April 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--author, article name, &amp; p#?--&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2018}}

The [[wheelbase]] on all models is {{convert|97.0|in|mm}}. Width is {{convert|65.4|in|mm}}. The 1971 and 1972 models are {{convert|169.7|in|mm}} long. The 1973 models are {{convert|3|in|mm}} longer due to the front [[5 mph bumper|5&amp;nbsp;mph bumper]]. Front and rear 5&amp;nbsp;mph bumpers on 1974 to 1977 models add another {{convert|5.7|in|mm}}.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

The hatchback, with its lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat, accounted for nearly half of all Vegas sold.&lt;ref name="Gunnel1987"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Gunnell |editor-first=John |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1946–1975 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-87341-096-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sedan, later named "[[Notchback]]", is the only model with an enclosed trunk, and had the lowest base price.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;1973 Chevrolet Vega brochure&lt;/ref&gt; The Kammback wagon has a lower cargo liftover height and a swing-up liftgate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The [[sedan delivery#1970s|panel express]] has steel panels in place of the wagon's rear side glass, an enclosed storage area under the load floor, and a low-back driver's seat. An auxiliary passenger seat was optional.&lt;ref&gt;1971 Chevrolet Trucks full-line brochure.&lt;/ref&gt;  The low back seat was the result of this model being classified as a truck, which had fewer safety requirements than the passenger cars.

The aluminum-block, inline-four engine was a joint effort by General Motors, [[Reynolds Metals]], and [[SPX Corporation|Sealed Power Corp]]. The engine and its die-cast block technology were developed by GM engineering staff, then passed to Chevrolet for finalization and production. Ed Cole, involved with the 1955 [[Chevrolet small-block V8#265|small-block V8]] as chief engineer at Chevrolet and now equally involved with the Vega engine as GM president, often visited the engineering staff engine drafting room on Saturdays, reviewing the design and directing changes, to the consternation of Chevrolet engineers and manufacturing personnel, who knew he wanted a rush job.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; 
The engine in development became known in-house as "the world's tallest, smallest engine" due to the tall cylinder head.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Little-known Vega Development stories |first=John |last=Hinckley |journal=Cosworth Vega Magazine |issue=80 |date=1st Qtr. 2002 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its vibration, noise, and tendency to overheat were rectified by 1974.&lt;ref name="Cars magazine April 1974"/&gt;&lt;!--author, article name, &amp; p#?--&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2018}}

The Vega's suspension, [[live axle|live rear axle]], 53.2% front/46.8% rear [[weight distribution]], low [[center of mass]] and neutral [[recirculating ball|steering]] give good handling. [[Automobile handling|Lateral acceleration]] capacities are 0.90&amp;nbsp;g (standard suspension) and 0.93&amp;nbsp;g (RPO F-41 suspension). Steering box and linkage are ahead of the front wheel centerline, with a cushioned two-piece shaft. Front suspension is by short and long arms, with lower control arm bushings larger than on the [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|1970 Camaro]].&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet Vega engineering report – 1970&lt;/ref&gt; 
Four-link rear suspension copies the [[Chevrolet Chevelle#Second generation (1968–1972)|1970 Chevelle]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

There are [[coil spring]]s all around.&lt;ref name="Motor Trend-August 1970"&gt;''Motor Trend'', August 1970.&lt;!--author, article name, &amp; p#?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2018}}

The chassis development engineers aimed for full-size American car ride qualities with European handling. Later torque-arm rear suspension eliminated rear wheel hop under panic braking. Brakes (front discs, rear drums) copy an Opel design, with {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} diameter single-piston solid rotors, {{convert|9|in|adj=on}} drums and 70/30 front/rear braking distribution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

All models share the same hood, fenders, floor pan, lower door panels, rocker panels, engine compartment and front end.  In mid-1971, Chevrolet introduced an optional GT package for hatchback and Kammback models, which included the RPO L11 two-barrel 140 engine, F41 handling option, special tires, and trim.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

==Model year changes==
For 1972, models had a revised exhaust system and driveline to reduce vibration and noise; also revised [[shock absorber]]s. Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission and custom cloth interior were optional and a glove box was added.&lt;ref&gt;1972 Chevrolet Vega brochure.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1973, 300 changes included new exterior and interior colors and new standard interior trim. Front and rear nameplate scripts "Chevrolet Vega 2300" were changed to "Vega by Chevrolet". To meet the 1973 5&amp;nbsp;mph front [[Bumper (automobile)#First standards|bumper standards]] the front bumper, on stronger brackets, was extended {{convert|3|in}}, with a steel body-color filler panel. US-built Saginaw manual transmissions and a new shift linkage replaced the Opel units. The RPO L11 engine had a new Holley 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. New options included BR70-13 white-stripe steel-belted [[radial tire]]s, full wheel covers, and body side molding with black rubber insert. Two new models were introduced mid-year: the estate wagon with [[DI-NOC]] [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|wood grain sides]] and rear trim, and the LX notchback with [[vinyl roof]] finish. On May 17, 1973, the millionth Vega left the Lordstown Assembly plant – an orange GT hatchback with white sport stripes, power steering and neutral custom vinyl interior including exclusive vinyl door panels. A limited-edition "Millionth Vega" was introduced replicating the milestone car, with orange carpeting and Millionth Vega door handle accents. Sixty-five hundred were built from May 1 to July 1. For the first time, cloth upholstery was offered, with the Custom interior in black or blue.&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet press release, May 17, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1974, the major exterior changes were a revised front end and 5&amp;nbsp;mph rear bumper, increasing overall length {{convert|6|in}},&lt;ref&gt;1974 Chevrolet Vega brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; and a slanted front header panel with recessed headlamp bezels. Louvered steel replaced the egg-crate [[Grille#Material types|plastic grille]]. Front and rear aluminum bumpers with inner steel spring replaced the chrome items, with license plate mountings relocated. A revised rear panel on notchback and hatchback models had larger single-unit taillights, with ventilation grills eliminated from trunk and hatch lids. A {{convert|16|usgal|adj=on}} fuel tank replaced the {{convert|11|usgal|adj=on}} tank. Side striping replaced the hood and deck stripes for the GT sport stripes option. The custom interior's wood-trimmed molded door panels were replaced by vinyl door panels matching the seat trim. January saw plastic front fender liners added after thousands of fenders were replaced under [[warranty]] on 1971–1974 models. In February, the "Spirit of America" limited-edition hatchback was introduced, with white exterior, white vinyl roof, blue and red striping on body sides, hood and rear-end panel, emblems on front fenders and rear panel, white "GT" wheels, A70-13 raised white-letter tires, white custom vinyl interior and red accent color carpeting.&lt;ref&gt;1974 Chevrolet Folder-Spirit of America Vega.&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy-five hundred Vegas were built through May. Sales peaked at 460,374 for the 1974 model year.&lt;ref name="Gunnel1987"/&gt;

The 264 changes for 1975 included [[High energy ignition|H.E.I.]] (high-energy) [[Ignition system#Electronic ignition|electronic ignition]] and a [[catalytic converter]]. New options included power brakes, tilt steering wheel, BR78-13B steel belted radial tires, and special custom cloth interior for the hatchback and Kammback. In March the Cosworth Vega was introduced with an all-aluminum engine and electronic [[fuel injection]], the first on a Chevrolet passenger car.&lt;ref&gt;GM Heritage Center, Generations of GM History&lt;/ref&gt;  The panel express was discontinued at the end of the model year. Its sales peaked at 7,800 in its first year, then averaged 4,000 per year. Over 1,500 1975 models were sold.&lt;ref name="H Body.org FAQ"&gt;H Body.org FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; Total sales fell to 206,239.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
[[File:76 Cosworth Vega 2673.jpg|thumb|1976 [[Chevrolet Cosworth Vega|Cosworth Vega hatchback coupe]]]]

For 1976, models had 300 changes. A facelift included revised header panel with Chevy bowtie emblem, wider grill, revised headlamp bezels – all in corrosion-resistant material – and new tri-color taillights for the notchback and hatchback (although the amber turn signals were nonfunctional). Cooling and durability of the Dura-Built 2.3-liter engine were improved. The chassis received the Monza's upgraded components including box-section front cross-member, larger front and rear brakes (with the fronts gaining vented rotors), and torque-arm rear suspension. Extensive anti-rust improvements to the body included galvanized fenders and rocker panels. New models were introduced: GT estate wagon, Cabriolet notchback (with a half-vinyl roof and [[opera window]]s similar to the Monza Towne coupe) and limited-edition Nomad wagon with restyled side windows.&lt;ref&gt;1976 Vega brochure&lt;/ref&gt; New options included [[BorgWarner]] five-speed manual [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] transmission and [[houndstooth]] seat trim named "sport cloth" at an additional $18. A "Sky-Roof" with tinted reflecting sliding glass and an eight-track tape player were options from January. The Cosworth was canceled in July after 1,446 1976 models were built.&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet Division memo, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--using primary sources is okay, now?--&gt;

For 1977, models had few revisions. The notchback was renamed "coupe". On the Dura-built 140 engine, a [[Secondary air injection|pulse-air system]] met stricter Federal emission standards. The single-barrel engine and three-speed manual transmission were dropped. Interiors received a color-keyed steering column, steering wheel, instrument-cluster face and parking-brake cover, with a color-keyed full console a new option. GTs received black, exterior moldings (lower moldings deleted), black, sport mirrors and wheels, bold, Vega GT side striping and rear, Vega GT ID&lt;ref&gt;1977 Chevrolet Vega brochure.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compression ratio]] for the standard and optional engine is 8.0:1, as the engine was designed for low-lead and lead-free fuels. The single-barrel [[carburetor]] version produces {{Convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}; the two-barrel version ([[Regular Production Option|RPO]] L11) produces {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. From 1972, ratings were listed as SAE net. The engine is prone to vibration, which is damped by large rubber engine mounts. The 1972 [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] DualJet two-barrel carburetor required an air pump for emission certification and was replaced in 1973 with a Holley-built 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. The 1973 emission control revisions reduced power from the optional engine by {{convert|5|bhp|abbr=on}}, and its noise levels were lowered.&lt;ref&gt;''Road &amp; Track'', June 1973.&lt;!--author, article name, &amp; p#?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2018}} A [[high energy ignition]] was introduced on 1975 engines.&lt;ref&gt;1975 Chevrolet Vega brochure.&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious problems with the engine led to a redesign for 1976–1977. Marketed as the Dura-Built 140, the new engine had improved coolant pathways, redesigned cylinder head with quieter hydraulic valve lifters, longer-life valve stem seals that reduced oil consumption by 50%, and redesigned water pump, [[head gasket]], and [[thermostat]]. Warranty was upgraded to five years or {{convert|60000|mi}}.&lt;ref name="1976 Chevrolet Vega brochure"&gt;1976 Chevrolet Vega brochure&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 a [[Secondary air injection|pulse-air]] system was added to meet stricter 1977 U.S. [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emission regulations]] and the engine paint color (used on all Chevrolet engines) changed from orange to blue.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

==Stillborn engines==

===OHC L-10===
[[File:1973 Chevrolet XP-898 engine.JPG|thumb|[[Chevrolet Vega#Concept car|XP-898 concept]] prototype L-10 engine]]

The optional L-11 engine was part of the Vega development program from December 1968, initially with a tall iron cylinder head that had an unusual [[tappet]] arrangement and side-flow combustion chambers. The Chevrolet engine group then designed an aluminum [[Crossflow cylinder head|crossflow]] cylinder head with single central overhead camshaft, “[[Hemi engine|hemi]]" combustion chambers and big valves. This was lighter and about {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} lower than the Vega production head. Although numerous [[prototype]]s were built and manufacturing tooling started, the engine did not receive production approval. It would have given higher performance than the iron-head engine, without its [[Thermal expansion|differential expansion]] head gasket problems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===RC2-206 Wankel===
[[File:'74 GM Rotary engine.jpg|thumb|1974 Vega RC2-206 Wankel]]

In November 1970, GM paid $50 million for initial licenses to produce the [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]]. GM president Ed Cole projected its release in October 1973 as a 1974 Vega option. The [[General Motors Rotary Combustion Engine]] (GMRCE) had two rotors displacing {{convert|206|cuin|cc|0|abbr=on}}, twin distributors and coils, and an aluminum housing.&lt;ref name="Motor Trend, July 1973, p.52"&gt;''Motor Trend'', July 1973, p. 52.&lt;!--author &amp; article name?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; RC2-206 Wankels were installed in 1973 Vegas for cold weather testing in Canada.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

''Motor Trend''{{'}}s 1973 article ''The '75 Vega Rotary'' said, "[M]ileage will be in the 16–18 mpg range. Compared to the normal piston [engine] Vega's 20 to 26 mpg, the whole rotary deal begins to look just a little less attractive, what with the price of gasoline skyrocketing..."&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'', July 1973, p. 52.&lt;!--author &amp; article name?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

GM thought it could meet 1975 [[emissions standard]]s with the engine tuned for better fuel economy. Other refinements improved it to {{convert|20|mpgus|abbr=on}}, but brought apex seal failures and rotor-tip seal problems.&lt;ref name="Motor Trend, July 1973, p.52"/&gt; By December 1973 it was clear the Wankel, now planned for the [[Chevrolet Monza|Monza 2+2]], would not be ready for either production or emissions certification in time for the start of the 1975 model year. After paying another $10 million against its rotary licence fees, GM announced the first postponement. In April 1974 ''Motor Trend'' predicted the final outcome:&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'', April 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; on September 24, 1974, Cole postponed the engine, ostensibly due to emissions difficulties. He retired the same month. His successor [[Pete Estes]] showed little interest in the engine and GM, citing poor fuel economy, postponed production pending further development.&lt;ref&gt;Estes had previously decided to let the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]], another Cole project, expire, well before the celebrated attacks of [[Ralph Nader]]. ''Motor Trend'', April 1974.&lt;!--page #?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One complete GM Wankel engine exists. It is displayed at the Ypsilanti (MI) Motor Heritage Museum, along with many Corvair cars and exhibits.

===V8===
In July 1972, ''Hot Rod'' tested a prototype Vega fitted with an all-aluminum V8, the last of several 283 cu in. (4.6 L) units used in the [[Chevrolet Engineering Research Vehicle (CERV)|CERV I]] research and development vehicle. Bored out to {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, it had high-compression pistons, "097 Duntov" mechanical-lifter camshaft, cast-iron four-barrel intake manifold, and a Quadrajet carburetor. With stock Turbo Hydramatic, stock Vega rear end and street tires, the car ran a sub-14-second quarter mile.&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'', July 1972.&lt;!--author, article name, p#?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assembly==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lordstown Assembly - Chevy Vega.jpg|thumb|right|Building Chevrolet Vegas at Lordstown Assembly in Lordstown, Ohio]] --&gt;
[[File:Lordstown Assembly Vega.jpg|thumb|right|Lordstown Assembly, Vega Final Line]]

GM built the $75 million [[Lordstown Assembly#Lordstown Assembly production|Lordstown Assembly]] plant in [[Lordstown, Ohio]] near [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] to make the Vega. It was the world's most automated auto plant,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; where approximately 95 percent of each Vega body's 3,900 [[welding|welds]] were carried out automatically by [[Unimate]] [[industrial robot]]s. Engine and rear axle assemblies positioned by hydraulic lifts with bodies overhead moved along the line at {{convert|30|ft}} per minute. Sub-assembly areas, conveyor belts and quality control were all computer directed.&lt;ref name="Motor Trend, February 1971"&gt;''Motor Trend'', February 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production speed===
Production at Lordstown was projected at 100 Vegas an hour—one every 36 seconds—from the outset. Twice the normal volume, this was the fastest rate in the world. Within months Lordstown produced 73.5 Vegas an hour.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Lordstown workers had 36 seconds to perform their tasks instead of the customary minute. With 25 percent more line workers than needed, they formed groups in which three worked while a fourth rested.  Although there were mechanical flaws, the quality of early Vega assembly, e.g. fit and finish, was acceptable. The car earned ''Motor Trend's'' 1971 Car of the Year award. In October 1971, General Motors handed management of Lordstown from Chevrolet and Fisher Body to General Motors Assembly Division (GMAD). GMAD imposed more rigorous discipline and cut costs by dropping the fourth "extra" worker. The [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) said 800 workers were laid off at Lordstown in the first year under GMAD; GMAD said 370. Management accused workers of slowing the line and sabotaging cars by omitting parts and doing shoddy work. Workers said GMAD sped up the line and cut staffing. Quality suffered. In March 1972, the 7,700 workers called a [[wildcat strike]] that lasted a month and cost GM $150&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Vega production rose by over 100,000 units for 1972, and would have been stronger but for the strike. 1975 was a "rolling model change" at 100 cars per hour with no downtime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

As production approached 100 vehicles per hour problems arose in the paint shop. At 85 units per hour, nearly all required repair. Conventional spray pressures and [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizing tips]] could not apply the paint fast enough, but increasing pressures and tip apertures produced runs and sags. [[Fisher Body]] and lacquer paint supplier [[DuPont]], over one weekend, developed new paint chemistry and application specifics: Non-Aqueous Dispersion Lacquer (NAD). The new formulation raised paint shop throughput to 106 units per hour.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

===Vertical rail transport===
[[File:Vert A Pac railcar.jpg|thumb|right|30 Vegas to a single Vert-a-pac]]
Although Lordstown Assembly had a purpose-built exit off of the [[Ohio Turnpike]] built to make shipment easier, the Vega was designed for vertical shipment, nose down. General Motors and [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] designed [[Autorack#Vert-A-Pac and Stac-Pac|"Vert-A-Pac"]]  rail cars to hold 30 Vegas each, compared with conventional tri-level autoracks which held 18. The Vega was fitted with four removable cast-steel sockets on the underside and had plastic spacers—removed at unloading—to protect engine and transmission mounts. The rail car ramp/doors were opened and closed via [[forklift]].&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Mechanics'', October 1969, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vibration]] and low-speed crash tests ensured the cars would not shift or suffer damage in transit. The Vega was delivered topped with fluids, ready to drive to dealerships, so the engine was baffled to prevent oil entering the number one cylinder; the [[car battery|battery]] filler caps high on the rear edge of the casing prevented acid spills; a tube drained fuel from carburetor to vapor canister; and the windshield washer bottle stood at 45&amp;nbsp;degrees.&lt;ref&gt;''Collectible Automobile''. April 2000 p. 37 "Riding the rails: Shipping Vegas by Vert-a-pac."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production figures===
Total Vega production, mainly from Lordstown, was 2,006,661 including 3,508 Cosworth models.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Collectible Automobile April 2000 p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Production peaked at 2,400 units per day. In 1973–1974, Vegas were also built at GM of Canada's [[Sainte-Thérèse Assembly|Sainte-Thérèse Assembly plant]] in Quebec.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

==Pricing==
Due mostly to [[inflation]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}, but also because of emissions and safety mandates, prices of all automobiles rose 50 percent during the Vega's seven-year lifespan. The same basic Vega that cost $2090 in 1971 carried a retail price of $3249 by the end of 1977. And since all other cars suffered the same inflationary rise, less expensive cars were in greater demand than those with higher prices which helped Vegas sell. The 1975 Cosworth Vega at $5,918 was priced $892 below the [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. "Cosworth. One Vega for the price of two", as it was advertised, was priced out of the market, and fell well short of its projected sales goal.&lt;ref&gt;Collectible Automobile April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==DeLorean influence==
[[File:DeLorean and Vega in 1971.jpg|thumb|John DeLorean and Vega 2300 in 1970]]

GM Vice President [[John Z. DeLorean]], appointed Chevrolet's general manager a year before the Vega's introduction, was tasked with overseeing the Vega launch and directing operations at the Lordstown Assembly plant. As problems with the vehicle became apparent, he put additional inspectors and workers on the line and introduced a computerized quality control program in which each car was inspected as it came off the line and, if necessary, repaired.&lt;ref name="JDL"/&gt; He was also tasked with promoting the car in ''Motor Trend'' and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazines. He authorized the Cosworth Vega prototype, and requested initiation of production.&lt;ref&gt;''Car and Driver'', "How To Hatch an Engine", October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Motor Trend''{{'}}s August 1970 issue, DeLorean promoted the upcoming car as one that out-handled “almost any” European sports car, out-accelerated “any car in its price class”, and would be “built at a quality level that has never been attained before in a manufacturing operation in this country, and probably in the world."&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'', August 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1979 book ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors'' by J. Patrick Wright, DeLorean spoke of hostility between Chevrolet Division and GM's design and engineering staff; of trying to motivate Chevrolet engineers to resolve the car's problems before introduction; and of initiating quality control.&lt;ref name="automotive1979"/&gt; He also said "While I was convinced that we were doing our best with the car that was given to us, I was called upon by the corporation to tout the car far beyond my personal convictions about it."&lt;ref name="automotive1979"/&gt;

==Problems==
Although the Vega sold well from the beginning, the buying public soon questioned the car's quality. The issues with the vehicle practically went back to the beginning of the development for example, the front end of the vehicle separated in only eight miles on the General Motors Test track.  The engineers had to add twenty pounds of structural reinforcements to pass durability.&lt;ref name="automotive1979"&gt;{{cite web |last1=KURYLKO |first1=Diana |title=The Vega: An unmitigated disaster |url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20111031/CHEVY100/310319922/the-vega-an-unmitigated-disaster |website=Automotive News |accessdate=6 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Comeback:The Fall &amp; Rise of the American Automobile Industry'', the authors write: "In 1972, GM issued three mass recalls, the largest covering 500,000 Vegas, to fix defective axles, balky throttles and problems that caused fires. The Vega's aluminum engine was notorious for buckling and leaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comeback: The Fall &amp; Rise of the American Automobile Industry |author1=Paul Ingrassia |author2=Joseph B.

===Recalls===
The first Vega recall, Chevrolet campaign number 72-C-05, addressed engine backfires on 130,000 cars fitted with L-11 option two-barrel carburetor.  An engine that backfired with specific frequency and magnitude weakened and ruptured the muffler.  Hot exhaust gasses then in turn spilled out and heated the adjacent fuel tank which expanded, ruptured and spilled fuel which ignited and caused a fire.&lt;ref name="Defect"&gt;{{cite book |title=Motor Vehicle Safety Defect Recall Campaigns 1972-74 |date=1973 |publisher=US DOT |page=25 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3907856&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Auto Safety Repairs at No Cost - Hearings Before Committee on Commerce United States Senate |date=1973 |publisher=US Government Printing Office |location=Washington |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jmExTh7vtoC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=1965-69+chevrolet+engine+mount+recall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ug32i0pTb_&amp;sig=ACfU3U0osjmrm9_NUHGm1uKKHSEy9hhKjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2iOGesbHoAhUHCs0KHXVwAX8Q6AEwGXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1965-69%20chevrolet%20engine%20mount%20recall&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second recall in early summer 1972, Chevrolet campaign number 72-C-07, involved 350,000 vehicles equipped with the standard engine and single barrel carberator. It  concerned a perceived risk that a component in the emission control system (idle stop solenoid bracket) might fall into the throttle linkage, jamming it open.&lt;ref name=SaferMotoring197207&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bill |last=Schwartzberg |title=Report from America|journal=Safer Motoring |page=368 |date=July 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chevrolet told customers if the throttle stuck open while driving to turn off the ignition and brake the vehicle until it stopped. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chevrolet's Vega Recall Hits 350,000 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/294448537/?terms=chevrolet%2Bvega%2Brecall |accessdate=Marion Star |date=9 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defect"/&gt;

In July 1972, the company announced the third recall, "in as many months,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vega Troubled by String of Recalls |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/502150535/?terms=chevrolet%2Bvega%2Brecall |agency=The Windsor Star |date=21 July 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign number 72-C-09, which affected 526,000 vehicles the result of which was a rear axle which could separate from the vehicle. As it was recorded by [[NHTSA]], the "axle shaft and wheel could then move outboard of the quarter panel and allow vehicle to drop down onto rear suspension." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NHTSA |url=https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/1972/CHEVROLET/VEGA#recalls |website=nhtsa.gov |accessdate=23 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===140 CID engine===
Other quality issues plagued the engine. Faulty valve-stem seals caused excessive oil consumption,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; but this was not addressed until the release of the updated Dura-built engine in 1976.&lt;ref name="chevrolet1976"&gt;1976 Chevrolet brochure-Vega Dura-built engine-built to take it&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', "When the engine got hot, which wasn't uncommon, the cylinders distorted and the piston rings wore off the exposed silica that was meant to provide a tough wall surface. Then, at best, the cars burned more oil. At worst, the distortion compromised the head gasket."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a6424/how-the-chevy-vega-almost-destroyed-gm/|title=The Car That Nearly Destroyed GM|date=2010-10-19|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its small {{convert|6|USqt|l|1}} capacity and tiny two-tube {{convert|1|sqft|m2|1|abbr=on}} [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]], the Vega cooling system was adequate when topped off,&lt;ref&gt;''Collectible Automobile'', April 2000, interview Eudell Jackobson &amp; Fred Kneisler of GM engineering.&lt;/ref&gt; but owners tended not to check the coolant level often enough, and in combination with leaking valve-stem seals the engine often ran low on oil and coolant simultaneously. Consequent overheating distorted the open deck block, allowing antifreeze to seep past the head gasket, which caused piston scuffing inside the cylinders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Chevrolet added a coolant overflow bottle and an electronic low-coolant indicator in 1974 that could be retrofitted to earlier models at no cost. Under a revised {{convert|50000|mi|km|-3|adj=on}} engine warranty for 1971 to 1975 Vegas, the owner of a damaged engine could choose replacement with a new short block or a rebuilt steel-sleeved unit, which proved costly for Chevrolet. GM engineer Fred Kneisler maintains that too much emphasis had been put on overheating problems, the real culprits being brittle valve stem seals and too-thin piston plating. Regardless of the cause, damaged cylinder walls were common.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

===Fisher Body===
[[File:Lordstown Vega Elpo dip.jpg|thumb|Fisher Body Vega Elpo dip]]
On the early Vegas, Fisher's rustproofing process did not treat the entire chassis. The six-stage zinc phosphate rustproofing process began with the untreated steel body shells spending two minutes submerged in a {{Convert|65000|usgal|L impgal|0}} [[electrophoretic painting]] vat ([[Fisher Body|Fisher Body Division]]’s "Elpo" [[electrophoretic|''e''lectrophoretic]] ''d''eposition of ''po''lymers process) to prime and further protect from rust. Assembled bodies were dried, wet-sanded, sealer-coated, sprayed with [[acrylic lacquer]] and baked in a {{convert|300|F|C K|abbr=on}} degree oven.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

However, there was a process failure during the vat treatment stage because a trapped air pocket prevented the anti-rust coating from reaching a gap between the Vegas’ front fenders and cowl. Under normal driving conditions, this allowed moist debris and salt to build up and rust the untreated steel on early Vegas because they had no protective liners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The finance department had rejected liners as they would have added a $2.28 unit cost. After GM spent millions replacing thousands of corroded fenders under warranty, Chevrolet installed stopgap plastic deflectors in late 1973 and full plastic liners in 1974. Rust also damaged the rocker panels and door bottoms, the area beneath the windshield, and the body above the rockers. It sometimes seized the front suspension cam bolts, preventing alignment work, necessitating removal with a cutting torch and replacement by all-new parts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

From 1976, anti-rust improvements included [[galvanized]] steel fenders and rocker panels; "four layer" fender protection with zinc coated and primed inner fenders; wheel-well protective mastic; zinc-rich pre-prime coating on inner doors; expandable sealer between rear quarter panel and wheel housing panel; and corrosion-resistant grill and headlamp housings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The 1976 to 1977 Dura-Built 140 engine had improved engine block coolant pathways, redesigned head gasket, water pump and thermostat, and a five-year/{{convert|60000|mi|km|-3|abbr=on}} warranty.&lt;ref name="chevrolet1976"/&gt;

Initially the Vega received awards and praise, but subsequently there were lasting criticisms.{{fact|date=August 2019}}

The Vega received awards including "1971 car of the year"&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'', February 1971. "1971 Car of The Year: Chevrolet Vega 2300."&lt;/ref&gt; 
and "1973 car of the year in the economy class";&lt;ref name="Monte Carlo p.52"&gt;''Motor Trend'', February 1973. "The Car of the Year Candidates"&lt;/ref&gt; 
from ''[[Motor Trend]]''; "best economy sedan" in 1971, 1972 and 1973 from ''Car and Driver'';&lt;ref&gt;''Car and Driver'', May 1971, May 1972, May 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
and the 1971 award for "excellence in design in transportation equipment" from ''American Iron and Steel Institute''.&lt;ref&gt;1973 Chevrolet folder: back cover-Best Economy Sedan for '73-Vega.&lt;/ref&gt;

Favorable reviews at launch included ''Motor Trend'' which in 1970 described the Vega as enjoyable, functional, comfortable, with good handling, and ride;&lt;ref name="Motor Trend-August 1970"/&gt;
''Road and Track'' who praised its visibility, freeway cruising and economy.&lt;ref&gt;''Road and Track'', September 1970. pp.31–34&lt;/ref&gt;
and others who praised the 2300 engine's simplicity,&lt;ref&gt;quoted from: ''Sports Car Graphic'', September 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  
the handling package and brakes,&lt;ref&gt;''Road Test'', November 1970, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and one said the car was well matched to the tastes and needs of the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Quote, ''Super Stock'', October 1970, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
Others praised its looks.&lt;ref&gt;''Car and Driver'', December 1971, "Super Coupe Comparison Test" p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Car and Driver 1972 Buyer's Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caranddriver06"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Chevrolet Vega vs. Ford Pinto |journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1971 |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/chevrolet-vega-vs-ford-pinto-archived-comparison |accessdate=2011-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Comparisons with other contemporary cars such as the [[Ford Pinto]], [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[AMC Gremlin]], and [[Toyota Corolla]]  were done by a number of magazines. The Vega came out well, scoring praise for its combination of performance and economy";&lt;ref&gt;''Car and Driver'', January 1971. "Six-Car Comparison Test." p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'', January 1972, "A Back Door To Economy."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its speed, comfort, quietness and better ride.&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'', January 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Road and Track's'' editor, John R. Bond said in September 1970, "I think the Vega is beyond a doubt the best handling passenger car ever built in the U.S. It has many other good qualities, but the roadholding impressed and surprised me most of all."&lt;ref&gt;Road &amp; Track September 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Auto Safety]] criticized the car. A letter from its founder [[Ralph Nader]] to GM chairman Richard Gerstenberg contained a list of safety allegations, and said the car was a "sloppily crafted, unreliable and unsafe automobile" that "hardly set a good example in small car production for American industry".&lt;ref&gt;Kimes &amp; Ackerson, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms continued long after production ceased. In 1979, ''[[Popular Science]]'' said free repairs in the 1970s cost tens of millions, continuing up to two years after the warranty ran out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Dunne |journal=Popular Science |date=May 1979 |title=Secret car warranties |pages=58–60 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iwEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 |accessdate=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1990 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article said the Vega was "a poorly engineered car notorious for rust and breakdowns."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite magazine|title= The Right Stuff: Does U.S. Industry Have It? |magazine=Time Magazine |date=1990-10-29 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971481,00.html#ixzz1J7X8UtqM |accessdate=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Autos: Too Small, Too Soon |magazine=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913999,00.html |date=1976-04-05 |accessdate=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine called the Vega costlier and more troublesome than its rivals.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite journal|title=GM's Day Of Reckoning |journal=Newsweek |date=1991-12-30 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1991/12/29/gm-s-day-of-reckoning.html |accessdate=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Sherman's 1993 book ''In the Rings of Saturn'' said that "by its third recall, ninety-five percent of all Vegas manufactured before May 1972 had critical safety flaws", and that the model's "checkered history only reinforced the belief that GM made inferior small cars.  This legacy would prove far more important than any direct impact the Vega would have on GM's profits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/inringsofsaturn00sher |url-access=registration |title=In the rings of Saturn |page=[https://archive.org/details/inringsofsaturn00sher/page/70 70] |first=Joe |last=Sherman |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-19-507244-0 |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Motor Trend'' said in its September 1999 ''50th Anniversary Issue'': "The Vega seemed well placed to set the standard for subcompacts in the 70s, but it was troubled by one of the most vulnerable Achilles heels in modern automotive history; an alloy four-cylinder engine block that self-destructed all too easily, and all too often. Once the word got out the damage was done, even though the engine had been revamped."&lt;ref&gt;Quote, ''Motor Trend'', September 1999, Motor Trend 50th Anniversary Issue&lt;/ref&gt; The April 2000 issue of ''Collectible Automobile'' magazine said: "The Chevy Vega has become a symbol of all the problems Detroit faced in the 70's."&lt;ref&gt;''Collectible Automobile'', April 2000 p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert Freeland's 2005 book ''The Struggle for Control of the Modern Corporation'' said "poor planning and perfunctory implementation&amp;nbsp;... led to an extremely poor quality automobile beset by mechanical problems,"&lt;ref name="struggle"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Control of the Modern Corporation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |first=Robert F. |last=Freeland |year=2000 |page=288 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uj6te3wYm_0C&amp;pg=PA288 |isbn=978-0-521-63034-4 |accessdate=2011-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his 2010 book ''Generation Busted,'' author Alan Zemek said, "Chevrolet's answer to the Japanese car, left it with a black eye."&lt;ref name="busted"&gt;{{cite book| title=Generation Busted: How America Went Broke in the Age of Prosperity |first=Alan J. |last=Zemek |publisher=CreateSpace |year=2010 |page=122| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XVAzpX8xF4gC&amp;pg=PA122 |isbn=978-1-4515-1686-9 |accessdate=2011-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vega [[body style]]s were used for several [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] variants. The 1973 to 1977 [[Pontiac Astre]] had Vega bodies (and Vega engines through 1976). The 1978 to 1979 [[Chevrolet Monza]] and [[Pontiac Sunbird#1976–1980|Pontiac Sunbird]] wagons used the Vega Kammback wagon body with engines by [[Pontiac]] and [[Buick]].

In 1973, Chevrolet presented the XP-898 [[concept car]] using many Vega components, including the engine, and using a construction method intended to explore vehicle [[crashworthiness]] at high speed: a [[fiberglass]] foam sandwich body and chassis in four sections with rigid [[polyurethane|urethane]] foam infill.&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Bowman |title=1973 Chevrolet XP-898 Concept Car |publisher=General Motors Heritage Center |url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1973_Chevrolet_XP-898_Concept_Car |accessdate=2012-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626194757/https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1973_Chevrolet_XP-898_Concept_Car# |archive-date=2015-06-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motorsport==

===Car and Driver's showroom stock No. 0===

In the early 1970s ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine challenged its readers to a series of [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) races for showroom stock sedans at [[Lime Rock Park]], Connecticut – "The Car and Driver SS/Sedan Challenge". Bruce Cargill (representing the readers) won "Challenge I" in 1972 in a [[Dodge Colt]], and [[Patrick Bedard]], ''C&amp;D's'' executive writer, won "Challenge II" in 1973 in an [[Opel Ascona#Ascona|Opel 1900]], "Challenge III" was the tie-breaker in 1974.

[[File:73 Vega GT-bronze metallic.jpg|thumb|1973 Vega GT in metallic bronze]]

On October 12, 1974 ''C&amp;D's'' 1973 Vega GT No. 0, driven by Bedard, "outran every single Opel, Colt, Pinto, Datsun, Toyota and Subaru on the starting grid [...] It had done the job – this Vega GT faced off against 31 other well-driven showroom stocks and it had finished first.&lt;ref name="unlikely1975"/&gt;

After Bedard purchased the year-old Vega in California for $1,900, former Chevrolet engineer Doug Roe – a Vega specialist – told him to "overfill it about a quart. "When you run them over 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm, all the oil stays up in the head and you'll wipe the bearings. And something has to be done with the crankcase vents. If you don't it'll pump all that oil into the intake." Roe added that 215 degrees was normal and only above 230 degrees would the engine probably" [[detonate]].{{fact|date=August 2019}}

Bedard said, "Five laps from the end I discovered that once the tank drops below a quarter full, the fuel wouldn't pick up in the right turns. Twice per lap the carburetor would momentarily run dry. And if that wasn't bad enough, the temperature gauge read exactly 230 degrees and a white Opel was on my tail as unshakably as a heat-seeking missile. But it was also clear that no matter how good a driver Don Knowles was and no matter how quick his Opel, he wasn't going to get by if the Vega simply stayed alive. Which it did. You have to admire a car like that. If it wins, it must be the best, never mind all of the horror stories you hear, some of them from me."&lt;ref name="unlikely1975"&gt;''Car and Driver'', January 1975. "An unlikely victory in an even more unlikely car."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:55 Chevy in Turkey.jpg|thumb|1955 Chevy in Turkey 2007, with its owner]]
The '''1955 Chevrolet''' (sometimes referred to as ''''55 Chevy''') is an automobile that was made by [[Chevrolet]] in 1955. It is considered a huge turning point for the manufacturer and a major success. It was available in three models: the 150, 210, and Bel Air.

The '55 Chevy was the first successful Chevrolet with an optional [[V8 engine]]. Chevrolet had produced an earlier car with a V8 in 1918 ([[Chevrolet Series D]]), which used a 36-horsepower overhead valve 288-cubic-inch V8, but it remained in production for only a year.&lt;ref&gt;Lingeman, Jake. [http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/chevy-d-series-passes-through-three-generations-auction "Chevy D-Series passes through three generations before auction."] Autoweek. Crain Communications, Inc., 13 Sept. 2012. Web. 22 Dec. 2014. Accessed 2014-12-22. [https://www.webcitation.org/6VSjQQpZ5 Archived] 2015-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Chevrolet decided to fit its new car with an overhead valve V8 engine design, which was similar to the 1949 Oldsmobile "Rocket 88" V8 engine which was an earlier GM success. Chevy's new 265-cubic-inch overhead valve V8 was designed to be smaller, lighter, and more powerful than previous V8s in the auto industry, and would come to be known as the "Chevy small block".

However, the new small block engine in the '55 Chevy had some early teething issues. Some problems existed with cracked pistons, there was no integrated oil filter, so an external bypass filter was offered as a factory or dealer option. Those who did not order the engine with the "oil filter option" dealt with a high frequency of oil changes. Even with the oil filter option, only part of the oil was actually filtered (the oil going through the thermostat). This issue was corrected for the next year when a full flow oil filter system was added to the engine.
Additionally, to keep performance and mileage levels high required spark plug and ignition points to be replaced on a regular basis. But other than those issues it was an easy to maintain engine. The small block Chevy V8 became so popular that Chevrolet still sells it today as an over the counter replacement engine or better known as a "crate engine". There have been various changes made to the engine to modernize it since its introduction in 1954 however the basic design of the original 265 remains in place.

==Body design==

Additionally, Chevrolet drastically changed its body design. 
The 1955 Chevy had smooth straight panels on the sides and hood. This was a major departure from previous years for Chevrolet. Although Ford introduced what would be the first "shoe box" body design in 1949, GM and Chrysler were slow to catch on, only slowly replacing some of their bubble-like hood and side panels with flatter ones each year, without achieving a full shoebox look by 1954. But in 1955, Chevy designed the entire car with the full shoebox look. Along with the flatter straighter panels, the '55 also had modern cues like wrap-around glass on the windshield, and triangular tail lights that jutted outward. This new look, combined with new power and engineering, made the '55 an instant hit with the buying public and a critical success.
 
The car's popular "shoe-box" body style and chassis were carried over to 1956 (with changes to some of the front and rear aesthetics and bottom body line), and then carried over to 1957 (where the body was lengthened several inches in the rear and more drastic aesthetic changes were made).

The '55, '56 and '57 Chevys are extremely sought after by collectors, enthusiasts and hot rodders, and the three model years are often referred to by the given nickname of the "tri-fives." Collectors will pay a premium for two-door models, and even more for the Bel Air version, especially the two-door hardtop (two-door, no side post). Today, 1955 Chevy two door hard tops command top dollar.

==Options and trim==
[[File:1955-chevy-210-chevrolet-archives.jpg|thumb|1955 Chevy 210]]
The 1955 Chevrolet also offered many other firsts for Chevrolet, including changing from a 6-volt to a 12-volt electrical system. The '55 offered new options like air conditioning, power windows, power seats, power steering and power brakes. Other options included automatic light dimmers, door handle protectors, bumper protectors and "wonder-bar" radios. So many new options were available that some referred to the car as "Chevy's little Cadillac." Never before had so many options been offered for a car in the low-price field.

The '55's top trim offering was the Bel-Air, which had more chrome than the 150 or 210. The Bel-Air, 210 and 150 model could be bought as a four-door, or could be bought as a two door with a post between the front and rear passenger windows, known as the two-door sedan.

The Bel-Air or 210 model could also be had as a two door with no post between the side windows. This was known as the sport coupe, or better known by collectors as "the two door hardtop". Since this model had no post between the two side windows, it had a shorter roof and longer rear deck than the two door sedan had. Chevy also offered a convertible, with the same shorter roof and longer rear deck as the sport coupe, and it was offered in Bel-Air trim only.

1955 also saw the introduction of the Bel Air Nomad, a sporty two-door station wagon which featured frameless door glass and elongated side windows. The unique roof design of the Nomad came directly from the 1954 Corvette Nomad, a "dream car" designed to be shown at auto shows as a concept sport wagon. Although regarded as one of the most beautiful station wagon designs of Fifties, the Nomad sold poorly, partly due to its price tag (one of the most expensive models in the Bel Air lineup) as well as its lack of four doors. Also the Nomad's two-piece tailgate design was prone to let excess rainwater leak through to the interior.

The '55 offered a wide array of colors. One solid color, which was standard for the 150, could be had for the 210 or Bel Air...or nineteen different two-tone color combinations were also available.

Along with a standard column-mounted three speed Synchro-Mesh transmission, the buyer of a '55 Chevy could specify an optional Overdrive unit to go with it, or the fully automatic two-speed Powerglide transmission. Although most everything was new in 1955 for Chevrolet, the reliable Powerglide was mostly unchanged from '54.

==Models==
There were nine different variations of the three models made in 1955, with differences in body, roof type, number of doors, and available equipment, but not all possible combinations were sold.

==Engines==

The following engines were available on the 1955 Chevrolet:
* OHV Inline 6 cylinder: 235 cubic inch, 123 horsepower
* OHV Inline 6 cylinder: 235 cubic inches, 136 brake horsepower (SAE)
* OHV V8: 265 cubic inches, 162 brake horsepower (SAE)
* OHV V8: 265 cubic inches, 180 brake horsepower (SAE), also known as the "Power Pack" engine
* OHV V8: 265 cubic inches, 195 brake horsepower (SAE), late in the model year, known as the "Super Power Pack"

The 265 was new for 1955, and it was the first V8 available in a Chevrolet since 1918 Model "D" was offered. That car did not sell well due to its price during an oncoming recession throughout World War-I, so Chevy reverted to OHV inline 4-cylinder engines until 1929 when Chevy switched to an inline 6-cylinder engine. This reliable six cylinder would power chevy cars until 1963&lt;ref&gt;[[:en:Chevrolet straight-6 engine]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was known as the "stove-bolt six". However, the new 265 V-8 in 1955 offered more power than the six, and weighed 100 pounds less.

The 265 was a big success, and was fitted to the majority of Chevrolet cars for decades in various cubic inch displacements. It is commonly referred to as the "Small Block Chevy" motor.

==Transmissions==
The car contained one of three transmission types, all with the shifter on the column:

* 3-speed Synchromesh manual 
* 3-speed Synchromesh manual with overdrive 
* 2-speed automatic "powerglide."

All models had the three transmission options.

[[Powerglide]] (1950-1952)
}}

The '''Chevrolet Deluxe''' was a trim line of [[Chevrolet]] automobiles, marketed from 1941 to 1952, and was the volume sales leader for the market during the 1940s. The line included, at first a [[Sedan (automobile)|4-door sedan]], but grew to include a fastback 2-door "aerosedan" and other body styles. The 1941 Chevrolet was the first generation that didn't share a common appearance with Chevrolet trucks, while the [[Chevrolet AK Series]] truck did share common internal components.

The original series ran from 1941 to 1948, after which a new body style was introduced for 1949, running through 1952. During the post-war years and continuing through the early 1950s, the Deluxe range was Chevrolet's sales leader, offering a balance of style and luxury appointments unavailable in the base Special series; and a wider range of body styles, including a convertible, Sport Coupe hardtop (starting in 1950), two- and four-door sedans and four-door station wagons.

== Specifications ==
In the 1941/42 model years, the 216cid [[Straight-6|inline 6]] "Victory Six" engine was the only one offered. It produced 85 horsepower at 3300 rpm. In 1947 output was bumped up to 90 horsepower. A Deluxe of this vintage could easily exceed 80 miles per hour without overdrive. The transmission was a [[Manual transmission|manual]] synchromesh 3 speed, with vacuum assisted shift, in which the "three-on-the-tree" shifter&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1946"/&gt; was able to be moved between gears by the slightest pressure on the lever. Third gear was direct, meaning the input and output are equal speeds. Overdrive was a rare option. Connection to the third member rear-end was via an enclosed "torque tube" driveshaft. The brakes were hydraulic with all-wheel drums. The master cylinder was located beneath the driver. [[Shock absorber]]s were of the lever type. The windshield through 1952 was of a split, flat-glass type. The wipers were vacuum actuated. Chevrolet offered windshield washers on some years.

==Style ==
The exterior sported smooth curves with chrome and stainless trim. The rear bumper had an optional center bumper guard that had to be ratcheted out of the way so the trunk cover could be lifted. Front and rear bumpers had optional chrome "tips", a dress-up item that bolted to the ends of the stock bumper. Although it wasn't a Chevrolet option, a popular [[Aftermarket (automotive)|after market]] feature was a large external sunshade that protected the driver from glare off the metal [[dashboard]].

The interior had cloth bench seats and a metal dash, sometimes with a simulated burl wood grain. The radio was a simple mono [[vacuum tube]] type radio with integrated speaker. On the left side of the radio was the [[Throttle#Internal_combustion_engines|throttle]] knob, marked "T".  On the right side of the radio was the [[choke valve|choke]] knob.  A manual-wind, 7-day clock was built into the glove compartment door.

==1941–1948==

[[File:1940 Chevrolet Special Deluxe Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1940 Chevrolet Special Deluxe]]
In 1941, the Master and Special Deluxe had updated styling from the year before with things such as a new grill, new suspension, new curves, and the headlight mounted in the fenders.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimes|first=Beverly|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1805-1942|year=1996|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-428-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special had better fabric than the Master, along with arm rests in the doors. There was full instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1941%20Chevrolet%20Manual-13.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1942 models got blackout trim in January. The Signal-Seeking radio became an option.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt; On February 1, 1942, civilian automobile production halted for war production.&lt;ref name="kimes1996"/&gt;

For the 1946 model year the names were changed to [[Chevrolet Stylemaster|Stylemaster]] and [[Chevrolet Fleetmaster|Fleetmaster]].&lt;ref name="flory2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Flory Jr.|first=J.

In 1949, all the Chevrolets got the first new styling after the war.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; The Deluxe was the brand new upper-end model for Chevrolet. The cheapest Deluxe was the Deluxe Styleline 6-passenger sedan, costing $1,492.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; Brakes were 11-inch drums.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1949"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1949_Chevrolet/1949_Chevrolet_Foldout/1949%20Chevrolet%20Foldout-12.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1949_Chevrolet/1949_Chevrolet_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had full instrumentation.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1949"/&gt; The front suspension had stabilizers.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1949"/&gt;
[[File:Chevy Deluxe rear.jpg|thumb|left|1951 Chevrolet Deluxe coupe (rear)]]

Many things changed starting in 1950, starting with a luxuriously-appointed hardtop coupe, called the [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]]. The new Bel Air including upgraded cord and leather-grain vinyl trim (available in a choice of several two-tone schemes), full carpeting and other appointments not available in even the Deluxe series, and a wide range of two-tone paint schemes. The 1950-1952 Bel Airs—during these early years, the Bel Air was officially part of the Deluxe range—shared only their front sheetmetal ahead of the A-pillar with the rest of the range. The windshield, doors, glass, and trunk were common with the Styleline convertible, but the roof, rear quarters and rear windows were unique.

The other change was the availability of [[Powerglide]], a two-speed [[automatic transmission]], exclusively in the Deluxe and Bel Air models. It was powered by a 235-cubic inch [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|six-cylinder engine]] developing 105 horsepower and had a 3.55:1 rear differential; the engine went on to become the "Blue Flame six." Models sold with the standard three-speed manual transmission got the usual 216.5-cubic inch engine, developing 92 horsepower.

Throughout the post-war years, many comfort, convenience and styling options were available, including tinted glass which was introduced in 1952, the final year for this style. Popular Mechanics rated fuel economy of 20mpg at 50&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ndgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Popular Mechanics|publisher = Hearst Magazines|date = June 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the 1952 model year, the old nameplates—Special and Deluxe—were retired, and changed to 150 and 210, respectively, with trim similar to their respective former series. The Bel Air model became a full series, including two- and four-door sedans, station wagon and convertible; and represented the top-end model with features similar to the 1950-1952 models (luxury interior, full carpeting and other features).

== International Markets ==
=== Australia ===
Australian assembly was undertaken by General Motors-Holden's Ltd of the four door sedan in Special trim as well as a locally designed two door coupe utility variant.[[File:1952 Chevrolet 52-1206B coupe utility (7143470007).jpg|thumb|Australian 1952 Chevrolet Styleline Special coupe utility]]
=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand assembly was undertaken by [[Holden New Zealand|General Motors New Zealand]] from 1947 at GM New Zealand's assembly plant in [[Petone]], [[Wellington]] from Semi-Knock down kits imported from GM's Canadian plant in [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]]. Being a fellow Commonwealth country, tariff rates were more favorable for Australia and New Zealand to import SKD kits from Canada than from the United States. All models were assembled in right-hand-drive.

The '''Chevrolet Fleetline''' is an automobile which was produced by [[United States of America|US]] automaker [[Chevrolet]] from 1941 to 1952. From 1946 to 1948 it was a sub-series of the [[Chevrolet Fleetmaster]] rather than a series in its own right and from 1949 to 1951 it was a sub-series of both the Chevrolet Special and the [[Chevrolet Deluxe]].&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt; In its final year it was offered only as a sub-series of the latter.&lt;ref name=Gunnell/&gt;

The Fleetline was introduced late in the 1941 model year as a four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]. In 1942, a fastback two-door "Aerosedan" was also offered. In 1947, the Fleetline made up 71.26% of Chevrolet's sales.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; For the years' 1949 through 1952 models, the fastback was the only one offered, and Chevrolet dropped the Fleetline for 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1951-chevrolet-fleetline-deluxe.htm |title=How Stuff Works |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was indefinitely  delayed in 1942 due to [[World War II]], after 110,000  had been made, though several thousand Chevrolet coupes and sedans were produced during the war years for military staff use. In 1945, production for civilians resumed.  The original series was produced through 1948.

A redesigned Fleetline with reduced body contour and integrated rear fenders was offered for the 1949 through 1952 model years.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; It was referred to as a "fastback" because of its distinct sloping roof which extends through to the trunk lid.  The Fleetline during the 1949 to 1950 years also has a lower look than a sedan, with the windshield being one inch shorter in height than a standard contemporary sedan.  The 1949 to 1951 models were made in both four-door and two-door models, with only the lower portion of the doors being interchangeable with a sedan door.  The Fleetline series is currently highly collectable. Many are made into [[hot rods|street rods]], with the common Chevrolet 350 small block V8 and the 350 or 400 turbo transmission being used.

== Specifications ==

In the 1941 and 1942 model years, the 216[[Cubic inch|cid]] [[inline 6]] "Blue Flame" engine was the only one offered. It produced 90&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet_Brochure/1942%20Chevrolet-14-15.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[horsepower]] at 3,300&amp;nbsp;rpm, and in 1950 higher compression bumped it up to 92 horsepower. Also in 1950, a 235.5CID one-bbl.carb six-cylinder engine with {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was added.&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt;  A Fleetline of this vintage could easily exceed 80 miles per hour without overdrive.  In very early models, the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was a manual [[synchromesh]] three-speed, with vacuum-assisted shift,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet_Brochure/1942%20Chevrolet-12-13.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet/1942_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the "three-on-the-tree" shifter was able to be moved between gears by the slightest pressure on the lever. Third gear was direct, meaning the input and output are equal speeds. From 1950 through the 1952 final year of its production, an automatic transmission was offered, which was quite sluggish. [[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]  was a rare option. Connection to the third member rear-end was via an enclosed "torque tube" driveshaft. The brakes were hydraulic with all-wheel drums. In 1951, the brakes got larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1951_Chevrolet/1951_Chevrolet_Foldout/1951%20Chevrolet%20Foldout-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1951_Chevrolet/1951_Chevrolet_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[master cylinder]] was located below the floor connected on the frame rail, beneath the driver.  Shock absorbers were of the lever type for the early years only.  The windshield for all years was of a split, flat-glass type.

== Style ==

The exterior sported smooth curves, chrome and stainless trim.   In the earlier models the rear bumper had an optional center bumper guard that had to be ratcheted out of the way so the trunk cover could be lifted.  Front and rear bumpers had optional chrome "tips", a dress-up item that bolted to the ends of the stock bumper. Not a Chevrolet option but a popular after market feature was a large external sunshade that protected the driver from glare off of the metal dash board. The 1949 to 1952 models were completely different than the earlier years with the fleetline "fastback" shape being quite distinct than a normal sedan shape.

The interior had cloth bench seats and a metal dash sometimes with a simulated burle woodgrain. The radio was a simple [[Monophonic sound|mono]] [[vacuum tube]] type radio with integrated speaker. An ash tray was located in the right side of the dash, close to the clock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1941%20Chevrolet%20Manual-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet/1941_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending upon the year there were both choke and throttle cables on the dash. On the right side was the choke lever. In the earlier years the clock was integrated into the glove compartment door and was of a manual-wind seven-day type. In the 1949 and 1950 models the clock was next to the glove box and with the redesigned dash board, the clock was on the top of the dash, in a center pod.  Also, this revised dash had two round pods for the speedometer and the other gauges while the 1949 and 1950 models had one large round pod directly in front of the steering wheel on the dash.

[[File:Chevrolet Agile 1.4 LS Spirit 2012 (13547991285).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of a 2012 Chevrolet Agile 1.4 LS Spirit]]
The '''Chevrolet Agile''' is a [[subcompact car]] that was developed by [[Chevrolet]] in [[Brazil]] and built in [[Argentina]]. The vehicle was powered by a [[GM Family 1 engine#GM do Brasil|Family 1 engine]] 1.4 L flex-fuel engine.

Based on the "GPiX Concept" which was introduced at the 2008 [[São Paulo]] Auto Show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevrolet unveils the GPiX concept|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/chevrolet-gpix.html|publisher=LeftLaneNews|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officially Official: GM debuts Chevy GPiX Concept in Sao Paulo|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/10/28/officially-official-gm-debuts-chevy-gpix-concept-in-sao-paulo/|publisher=Autoblog|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Agile went on sale in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Look: Chevrolet Agile|url=http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/agile/first-look-chevrolet-agile.html|publisher=Edmunds Inside Line|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and competes with the [[Volkswagen Fox]] and similar models. The second generation [[Chevrolet Montana]] [[coupé utility]] shares the same platform with Agile, as well as the 1.4 L engine.

==Features==
[[File:ChevroletAgileMDP.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Agile parked in [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina, 2016]]
The Agile was available in two trim levels; LT and LTZ, with a base LS in some markets. [[Anti-lock braking system]]s are available on the LTZ model.

==Engines==
In most South American markets, the 1389cc engine produces {{convert|92|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|120|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Especificaciones técnicas|url=http://www.chevrolet.com.ar/vehiculos/modelos-showroom/autos/agile/especificaciones-tecnicas/indice.html|publisher=Chevrolet Argentina|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian Agile Flexfuel 1.4L 8-valve engine produces {{convert|97|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|129|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} torque with petrol, {{convert|102|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|132|Nm|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}}with ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motorização e Freios|url=http://www.chevrolet.com.br/veiculos/todos-os-modelos/carros/agile/ficha-tecnica/motorizacao-freios.html|publisher=Chevrolet Brazil|accessdate=29 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104080931/http://www.chevrolet.com.br/veiculos/todos-os-modelos/carros/agile/ficha-tecnica/motorizacao-freios.html|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
The Chevrolet Agile has been rated as totally unsafe by Latin NCAP, scoring zero stars for adult occupants and two stars for children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinncap.com/data/pdf/chevrolet-agile-en.pdf Latin NCAP report] Chevrolet Agile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinncap.com/data/publicaciones/StatusReport_SafetyGainsArentGlobal.pdf IIHS Status Report] Safety gains aren't global&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement==
General Motors launched the [[Chevrolet Onix]] in 2012 to replace [[Chevrolet Celta]]. However the close size to Agile has made its future uncertain.

The '''Chevrolet Volt''' is a [[plug-in hybrid]] car manufactured by [[General Motors]], also marketed in [[rebadging|rebadged]] variants as the '''Holden Volt''' in Australia and New Zealand, '''Buick Velite 5''' in China, and with a different [[fascia (car)|fascia]] as the '''Vauxhall Ampera''' in the United Kingdom and as the '''Opel Ampera''' in the remainder of Europe. Volt production ended in February 2019.&lt;ref name="End2019"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chevy-volt-discontinued-chevrolets-last-volt-rolls-off-the-assembly-line/|title=Chevy Volt discontinued: Chevrolet's last Volt rolls off the assembly line|work=CBS News |date=2019-02-22|accessdate=2019-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales of the 2011 Volt began in the United States in mid-December 2010, followed by various European countries and other international markets in 2011. Global combined Volt/Ampera-family sales totaled about 177,000 units by the end of October 2018.&lt;ref name=Top5Global102018/&gt; The U.S. is the leading market, with 152,144 Volts delivered through the end of 2018, followed by Canada with 16,653 Volts sold through September 2018. Just over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Ampera cars had been sold in Europe {{as of|2016|06|lc=y}}, with the Netherlands leading the European region. {{Asof|2018|09}}, the Volt/Ampera family of vehicles is the world's all-time best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle, and the Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling [[plug-in electric car]].

The Volt operates as a pure [[battery electric vehicle]] until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge. From there, its [[internal combustion engine]] powers an electric [[Electric generator|generator]] to extend the vehicle's range as needed. When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked (by a clutch) to a [[planetary gear]] set, and hence the output drive axle, to improve energy efficiency. The Volt's [[regenerative braking]] also contributes to the on-board electricity generation. Under the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) cycle, the 2013/15 [[model year]] Volt [[all-electric range]] is {{convert|38|mi|abbr=on}}, with a combined electric mode/gasoline-only rating of {{Convert|62|mpgus|abbr=on}} [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|equivalent]] (MPG-equivalent).

The [[Chevrolet Volt (second generation)|second-generation Volt]]'s improved battery system and drivetrain increased the all-electric range to {{Convert|53|mi}}, its EPA-rated fuel economy in [[charge-sustaining]] mode to {{Convert|42|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, and the combined city/highway fuel economy in [[all-electric mode]] to 106 MPG-e, up from 98 MPG-e. Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. and Canada began in October 2015 as a 2016 [[model year]].

The Volt has won several awards, including the 2009 [[Green Car Vision Award]], 2011 [[Green Car of the Year]], 2011 [[North American Car of the Year]], 2011 [[World Car of the Year|World Green Car]], 2012 [[European Car of the Year]], and 2016 Green Car of the Year.

The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]]' (SAE) definition of a hybrid vehicle states that the vehicle shall have "''two or more energy storage systems both of which must provide propulsion power, either together or independently.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
=== Concept vehicle ===
The Chevrolet Volt [[concept car]] debuted at the January 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]], becoming the first-ever [[series hybrid|series]] [[plug-in hybrid]] [[concept car]] shown by a major car manufacturer.&lt;ref name=IEEE2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010607&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/01/gm_introduces_e.html?cid=27360790 |title=GM Introduces E-Flex Electric Vehicle System; Chevrolet Volt the First Application |work=[[Green Car Congress]] |publisher=BioAge Group |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Volt concept vehicle had four doors with a rear [[liftgate]] and seating for four passengers. This was a significant change in design when compared to the [[General Motors EV1]] of the 1990s, which only seated two to reduce weight and to make the necessary room for the [[lead-acid battery]] pack. The top speed was also increased on the Volt, from the electronically limited {{convert|80|mph|km/h|-1}} to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|-1}}. The battery pack size was reduced, from about {{convert|300|L|cuft|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in volume in the EV1, to {{convert|100|L|cuft|abbr=on|1|order=flip}} in the Volt.&lt;ref name=IEEE2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/lithium-batteries-for-hybrid-cars |title=Lithium Batteries for Hybrid Cars |last=Voelcker |first=John |work=IEEE Spectrum |date=January 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-14 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521102837/http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/lithium-batteries-for-hybrid-cars |archivedate=2011-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|p=43}}

That was the crowbar that helped break up the log jam.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz's initial idea was to develop an [[all-electric car]], but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for global program management, quickly sketched out the powertrain layout, estimated the vehicle weight and  battery requirements, convinced Lutz that to avoid an expensive battery, [[range anxiety]] concerns, and lack of public [[charging station|charging infrastructure]], they could use a smaller battery pack with a small combustion engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the drive wheels, so it would be a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=91-16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lauckner |first1=Jon |title=A Car Guy's Electric Moment |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-car-guys-electric-moment/ |accessdate=5 November 2019 |work=www.cbsnews.com |date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Volt initial design parameters defined for the development of the concept car, then referred as the "iCar" in homage to the [[iPod]], were kept throughout the process up to the final production version. A key design parameter was a target of {{convert|40|mi|km}} for the [[all-electric range]], selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs, and mainly because research showed that in the U.S. 78 percent of daily [[commuting|commuters]] travel 40 miles or less. This target range lets drivers make most travel electrically driven, with the assumption that charging takes place at home overnight. This requirement translated to using a [[lithium-ion battery]] pack with an energy storage capacity of 16 {{kWh|link=yes}} considering that the battery would be used until the [[state of charge]] (SOC) of the battery reached 30%. This limit to the SOC was necessary in order to maintain operational performance under a wide range of environments, and to minimize the [[Battery (electricity)#Lifespan of rechargeable batteries|battery degradation]] to allow at least a ten-year life span. The initial target range for the gasoline engine/generator was set between {{Convert|250|to|300|mi}} and the vehicle had to be family size for four or five passengers.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=91-16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16503845|title=GM to unveil Volt electric concept car|agency=Associated Press|work=NBC News |date=2007-01-07|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key design decision was to develop the concept car based on a new family of common [[powertrain]] components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed [[Voltec]] drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain is an attempt to standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric]], to [[fuel cell vehicle|fuel cell-powered]] or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as [[engine-generator]] sets (genset) fueled by [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[biodiesel]], [[ethanol fuel]] ([[Neat ethanol fuel|E100]]), or [[flex-fuel]] ([[E85]]). [[Regenerative braking]] would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation.&lt;ref name=GCC010607/&gt;{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=29–33}}&lt;ref name=ABG010707/&gt; In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=29–33}}

The Volt concept car became the first application of the E-Flex (Voltec) drive system with a combination of an [[electric motor]], the same used in the [[Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell]], a {{convert|16|kW.h|MJ|abbr=on|lk=on}} [[lithium-ion]] battery pack with 136 [[kW]] of peak power, and a genset consisting of a small 1.0 L, 3-cylinder [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[flex-fuel]] capable engine linked to a {{convert|53|kW|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} generator. General Motors called this genset an electric vehicle (EV) range extender. The vehicle was propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of {{convert|120|kW|hp|abbr=on}} delivering 236&amp;nbsp;lb ft (320 Nm) of motoring [[torque]]. {{fact span|The concept car featured several advanced materials from GE Automotive Plastics that helped GM reduce the vehicle weight by up to 50 percent.|date=November 2019}}

The Volt concept featured a {{Convert|12|USgal|L impgal|abbr=on}} fuel capacity providing the vehicle a total driving range of around {{Convert|640|mi|abbr=on}}, which considered a gasoline fuel efficiency of about {{Convert|50|mpgus|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} [[all-electric range]]. According to General Motors estimates, a daily drive of {{Convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}}, combined with an overnight recharge to support the first 40 all-electric miles, would yield an effective gasoline fuel economy of {{Convert|150|mpgus|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GCC010607/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABG010707&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/01/07/detroit-auto-show-general-motors-e-flex-platform/ |title=A Look at the GM E-Flex Platform| last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam|work=Autoblog Green |date=2007-01-07|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors also emphasized that the Volt would further reduce dependence on imported oil if E85 ethanol was used instead of gasoline to power the on-board generator engine. Robert Lutz added that if the driver used E85, "''the fuel economy figure became 525 miles per'' (equivalent) ''petroleum gallon''", as only 15% of gasoline is used in this blend.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=35}}{{Sfn|Fletcher|2011|pp=73, 74}} General Motors also noted that actual production of the Volt depended on further battery development, because the required rechargeable batteries needed to make the Volt a viable vehicle did not exist in the market and had yet to be developed.&lt;ref name=GCC010607/&gt;{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=91-16}}{{Sfn|Fletcher|2011|pp=73, 74}} The concept car was actually powered by two 12-volt [[Lead–acid battery|conventional car batteries]], just enough power to allow the vehicle to move at low speeds in the stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lutz|first=Bob|title=Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business|year=2011|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover, [[Penguin Group]]|isbn=978-1-59184-400-6|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781591844006}} Location 2234 [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutz initially said the Volt was expected to sell around $30,000, based on the cost of a conventional car of that size with a conventional four-cylinder engine plus US$8,000 for the lithium battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Squatriglia |first1=Chuck |title=Bob Lutz Drives the Volt, Calls It 'Electrifying' |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/06/bob-lutz-drives/ |website=Wired |accessdate=5 November 2019 |date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voltcost"/&gt; Developers faced cost escalation as they found out the Volt could not share components from GM's compact car platform like power steering, power brake, air-conditioning compressor that were driven by a belt running off the engine, in addition to the cost of a compact {{convert|110|kW|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} electric motor and specialized microprocessors to control energy flow to the motor, GM eventually decided to price the Volt at a base price from around US$40,000.&lt;ref name="Voltcost"&gt;{{cite news |title=How Volt's cost rose and rose and rose . . . |url=https://europe.autonews.com/article/20090802/COPY02/308029996/how-volt-s-cost-rose-and-rose-and-rose |accessdate=5 November 2019 |work=Automotive News Europe |date=2 August 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US$1 billion cost to develop the Volt is equivalent to creating three vehicles on an existing platform.&lt;ref name="Voltcost"/&gt;

[[File:2008 Chevrolet Volt hatchback (concept) 01.jpg|thumb|right|First production version of the Chevrolet Volt at the 2008 [[Australian International Motor Show]]]]

The production design model officially unveiled on September 16, 2008, as part of General Motors centennial celebration at the [[Renaissance Center|Wintergarden]] headquarters in Detroit.&lt;ref name=GMPressRelease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prefix.com/Downloads/Volt.pdf|title=Chevrolet Volt Leads General Motors Into Its Second Century|date=2008-09-16|accessdate=2009-12-21|publisher=General Motors Company|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324034213/http://www.prefix.com/Downloads/Volt.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production model differed greatly in design from the original concept car.

Another reason was the use of General Motors' new global compact vehicle platform [[Delta II platform|Delta II]] to keep costs reasonable, and shared with the 2010 model year [[Chevrolet Cruze]].{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|p=71}} Another significant difference from the concept car is the seating, as the production Volt seats four rather than five passengers. This change was due to the higher-than-usual central tunnel that runs from the front console to the rear seat that houses the car's T-shaped battery pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Motavalli |first=Jim |date=2008-09-21 |title=G.M.

After the concept was put into the pipeline for production, General Motors began looking for a partner to develop the Volt's [[lithium-ion battery]] pack. The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different [[battery cell]] chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world.{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=48–57}} Due to their more promising cell technologies, two companies were selected in June 2007, [[Compact Power]] (CPI), which uses a lithium manganese oxide (LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) cell made by its parent company, [[LG Chemical]]; and [[Continental Automotive Systems]], which uses [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|lithium iron phosphate]] based [[Commodity cell|cylindrical cells]] made by [[A123Systems]].{{Sfn|Edsall|2010|pp=48–57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2007/06/05/breaking-gm-awards-two-battery-development-contracts-for-chevy/|date=2007-06-05|title=GM awards two battery development contracts for Chevy Volt|work=AutoblogGreen |last=Abuelsamid |first=Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Fletcher|2011|pp=84–89}} By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack [[prototype]]s, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008.

The 2011 Chevrolet Volt has a {{kWh|16}} / 45 A·h ({{kWh|10.4}} usable) [[lithium-ion battery]] pack that can be [[state of charge|charged]] by plugging the car into a 120-240 VAC residential electrical outlet using the provided [[SAE J1772]]-compliant charging cord. No external charging station is required.&lt;ref name="SAEJ1771" /&gt; The Volt is propelled by an [[electric motor]] with a peak output of {{convert|111|kW|hp|abbr=on}} delivering {{convert|273|lbft|Nm|abbr=on|0}} of torque. Capacity of the battery pack was increased to {{kWh|16.5}} ({{kWh|10.9}} usable) for 2013 models, which increased the all-electric range from {{convert|35|to|38|mi|abbr=on}}. Other specifications remained the same. The battery pack capacity was increased to {{kWh|17.1}} for 2015 models. This incremental upgrade is likely to reflect in an improvement in range over previous model years, but {{as of|2014|07|lc=y}}, the 2015 Volt has not been re-certified with the EPA.&lt;ref name="2015Volt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/2015-volt-gets-17-1-kwh-battery/|title=2015 Volt Gets Larger 17.1-kWh Battery|author=Jeff Cobb|work=HybridCars.com|date=2014-07-06|accessdate=2014-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the fuel filler must be depressurized before opening the tank. Also, the engine management system monitors the time since the engine last ran, and prompts the driver to run past the {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} [[all-electric range]] before recharging to consume some gasoline.

These units are connected via a [[planetary gear]] and three electrically controlled hydraulic [[clutch]]es to provide power output for propulsion in any of four programmed operating modes:&lt;ref name="GM-drive_unit" /&gt;

# Single motor electric – The primary motor runs solely on battery power, maximum propulsion power is 111&amp;nbsp;kW.
# Dual motor electric – At higher vehicle speeds the secondary motor engages over the planetary gear such that it reduces the speed of the primary motor. This facilitates higher efficiency and better mileage for the combined system, without increasing the maximum power.
# Single motor extended – The battery reaches its minimum charge, which triggers the combustion engine. The engine drives the secondary motor as a generator, via the charging electronics, to keep the minimum battery charge level. The primary motor can still provide its 111&amp;nbsp;kW for short acceleration, albeit not sustained.
# Dual motor extended – The electric motors are used again in dual configuration with increased efficiency at higher speeds. Additionally the gasoline engine contributes propulsion power via the planetary gear. While power is drained from the battery the amount is less than in mode 2 for the same propulsion power, thus extending the range.

The drivetrain permits the Volt to operate as a pure [[battery electric vehicle]] until its battery capacity has been depleted to a defined level, at which time it commences to operate as a [[Types of hybrid vehicle#Series hybrid|series hybrid]] design where the gasoline engine drives the generator, which keeps the battery at minimum level charge and provides power to the electric motors. The full charge of the battery is replenished only by loading it on the [[electrical grid]].&lt;br /&gt; While in this series mode at higher speeds and loads, (typically above {{Convert|30|mph}} at light to moderate loads) the gasoline engine can engage mechanically to the output from the transmission and assist both electric motors in driving the wheels, in which case the Volt operates as a [[Series-parallel hybrid|power-split or series-parallel hybrid]]. After its all-electric range has been depleted, at speeds between {{Convert|30|to|70|mph}}, the Volt is programmed to select the most efficient drive mode, which improves performance and boosts high-speed efficiency by 10 to 15 percent.&lt;ref name="NYTVolt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GCCVolt4Mode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/10/chevy-volt-delivers-novel-two-motor-four-mode-extended-range-electric-drive-system-seamless-driver-e.html#more|title=Chevy Volt Delivers Novel Two-Motor, Four-Mode Extended Range Electric Drive System; Seamless Driver Experience Plus Efficiency|work=Green Car Congress|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While operating modes are switched automatically the Volt allows the driver to choose from three drive modes: normal, sport and mountain. The mountain mode, which is expected to be required only under unusual power demand conditions, increases minimum battery [[state of charge]] (SOC) to around 45%, thus maintaining performance on steep and long grades. The driver hears more engine noise due to the higher rate of power generation required to maintain this mode.&lt;ref name="GCCVolt4Mode" /&gt; The sport mode causes the engine to rev higher, and the response to the throttle pedal is quicker.&lt;ref name="PM101001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/reviews/hybrid-electric/volt-reliability-report-test|title=900 Miles Reliability Report in the Chevy Volt|work=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ampera has an additional option, the "City Mode" or "battery hold", allowing the driver to save the energy currently stored in the battery for use when traveling in urban areas or restricted zones.&lt;ref name="GCC021711" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Differences" /&gt; The 2013 model year Volt includes a "Hold" option to provide the same choice.&lt;ref name="Volt2013_02" /&gt;

==== Battery ====
{{See also|Electric vehicle battery}}

The 2011 Volt's [[lithium-ion battery]] (Li-ion) battery pack weighs {{convert|435|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and "consists of 288 individual cells arranged into nine modules. Plastic frames hold pairs of lithium-ion cells that sandwich an aluminum [[cooling fin]]. The design and construction of that aluminum plate was critical to ensuring an even temperature distribution with no hot or cool spots across the flat, rectangular cell. The battery pack has its own cooling circuit that is similar to, but independent from, the engine cooling system."&lt;ref name="Holden2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.print.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Feb/0214_battery.html |title=Cooling Fins Help Keep Chevrolet Volt Battery at Ideal Temperature |publisher=General Motors |location=US |work=GM Volt Media Portal |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chevrolet Volt charging WAS 2011 833.jpg|thumb|left|Inlet for the electrical charger in the left side of the Chevrolet Volt with the manufacturer's provided charging cord]]

For the 2011/2012 model years, the battery pack stores {{kWh|16}} of energy but it is controlled or buffered via the energy management system to use only {{kWh|10.3}} of this capacity to maximize the life of the pack. For this reason the battery pack never fully charges or depletes, as the software only allows the battery to operate within a [[state of charge]] (SOC) window of 65%, after which the engine kicks in and maintains the charge near the lower level. The minimum SOC varies depending on operating conditions. When the car needs more power, such as in mountain mode, the lower limit of the SOC rises to 45% to ensure enough power is available.&lt;ref name="Holden2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GCCVolt4Mode" /&gt; The battery capacity was increased to {{kWh|16.5}} for the 2013 [[model year]], the SOC window was increased to use {{kWh|10.8}} of the total battery energy, and the buffer to ensure battery life is not reduced. These changes increases the Volt's [[all-electric range]], but charging takes slightly longer. GM achieved the improved battery performance and durability through minor changes to the material composition of the battery cell chemistry.&lt;ref name="Volt2013_02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1076766_2013-chevy-volt-gets-38-mile-electric-range-higher-98-mpge-rating|title=2013 Chevy Volt Gets 38-Mile Electric Range, Higher 98-MPGe Rating |last=Voelcker |first=John |website=Green Car Reports |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volt2013_01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/06/2013volt-20120607.html |title=GM tweaks battery materials, pack size, SOC window to increase 2013 Chevrolet Volt EV range to 38 miles |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Green Car Congress |date=2012-06-07|accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating cost and payback period===
According to ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' in December 2011, the Chevrolet Volt fuel cost in electric mode was 3.8[[Cent (currency)|¢]]/mile.&lt;ref name="CR1211"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/12/leaf-volt-tests-show-electric-cars-cost-less-per-mile-to-operate.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108013333/http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/12/leaf-volt-tests-show-electric-cars-cost-less-per-mile-to-operate.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=2012-01-08 |title=Leaf, Volt Tests Show Electric Cars Cost Less per Mile To Operate |last=Evarts |first=Eric |work=Consumer Reports |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edmunds.com]], the price premium paid for the Volt in 2012, after discounting the {{USD|7,500}} [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#New plug-in electric vehicles|U.S. federal tax credit]], takes a long time for consumers to recover in fuel savings, often longer than the normal ownership time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/industry-center/analysis/will-higher-gas-prices-boost-hybrid-ev-sales.html|title=Will Higher Gas Prices Boost Hybrid, EV Sales? |last=Krebs |first=Michelle |website=Edmunds.com|date=2012-02-28|accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Volt received a five-star overall crash safety rating from the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), the highest possible score. This rating was obtained with NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program for 2011 [[model year]] vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/06/03/chevy-volt-earns-five-star-nhtsa-crash-rating-w-videos |title=Chevy Volt earns five-star NHTSA crash rating |work=AutoblogGreen |last=Blanco |first=Sebastien |date=2011-06-03 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Accident and rescue handling
In August 2010, General Motors began a training program for first responders when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. .&lt;ref name="1stResponders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/08/gmfr-20100827.html|title= General Motors Kicks Off National Electric Vehicle Training Tour For First Responders|work=Green Car Congress|date=2010-08-27|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Warning sounds
Due to significant noise reduction typical of vehicles traveling in [[all-electric mode]] at low speeds, the Volt is fitted with a manually activated [[Electric vehicle warning sounds|electronic warning sound system]] called ''Pedestrian-Friendly Alert System'' for use when the car is operating at low speeds to alert pedestrians to the car's presence.&lt;ref name="NYTRingT"&gt;{{cite web |last=Motavalli |first=Jim |date=2010-06-01 |title=Electric Car Warning Sounds: Don’t Expect Ring Tones |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/electric-car-warning-sounds-dont-expect-ringtones/ |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |at=Wheels |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chevrolet Volt WAS 2017 1731.jpg|thumb|left|2017 model year Chevrolet Volt]]

These improvements allow the 2016 Volt to deliver better EPA ratings than the first generation model. The all-electric range was officially rated at {{Convert|53|mi|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|38|mi|abbr=on}} attained by the 2015 Volt. The gains in efficiency allow the second generation Volt to improve its combined fuel economy in gasoline-only ([[charge-sustaining]]) mode to {{Convert|42|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|37|mpgUS|abbr=on}} for the previous model. The official second generation Volt's rating for combined city/highway fuel economy in [[all-electric mode]] is 106 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPGe; 2.2{{nbsp}}Le/100{{nbsp}}km), up from 98{{nbsp}}MPGe (2.4{{nbsp}}Le/100{{nbsp}}km) for the 2015 first generation model.&lt;ref name=EPAVolt2016&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/2016-chevrolet-volt-rated-for-53-miles-electric-range/|title=2016 Chevrolet Volt Rated For 53 Miles Electric Range|author=Jeff Cobb|publisher=HybridCars.com|date=2015-08-04|accessdate=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Volt2015_2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=36863&amp;id=35246|title=Compare Side-by-Side - 2016/2015 Chevrolet Volt|publisher=Fueleconomy.gov|author=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[U.S. Department of Energy]]|date=2015-09-01|accessdate=2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined gasoline-electricity fuel economy rating of the 2016 model year Volt is {{Convert|77|mpgus|abbr=on}} [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|equivalent]], 82{{nbsp}}MPGe (2.9{{nbsp}}Le/100{{nbsp}}km) in city driving and 72{{nbsp}}MPGe (3.3{{nbsp}}Le/100{{nbsp}}km) in highway.&lt;ref name=EPAtop10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/topten.jsp|title=Fueleconomy.gov's Top Fuel Sippers (EPA Ratings, All Years)

In April 2015, General Motors confirmed that it would not build the second generation Volt in [[right-hand-drive]] configuration. Due to low sales, only 246 units had been sold in Australia by mid-April 2015, and they discontinued the Holden Volt once they sold the remaining stock.&lt;ref name=Volt2Aust/&gt;

It is a 240-volt ([[Level 1, 2, and 3 charging#US Charging Standards|Level II]]) charger, and, according to General Motors, can replenish the Volt's batteries in about four hours. Consumer Reports has advised buyers to budget up to {{USD|2,000}}, as many older homes may need a substantial electrical upgrade because the U.S. [[National Electrical Code]] requires that the charger have its own dedicated 220-volt, 30-amp circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2010/10/pricing-chevrolet-volt-home-charger-to-cost-490-to-2-000/index.htm|title=Pricing: Chevrolet Volt home charger to cost $490 to $2,000|work=Consumer Reports|last=Evarts |first=Eric|date=2010-10-06|accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early buyers can benefit from the [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#Charging Equipment|federal tax credit]] available for charging equipment.&lt;ref name=Edm1010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/10/gm-prices-volt-home-charger-installation-names-national-installer.html|title=GM Prices Volt Home Charger, Installation; Names National Installer|work=Edmunds.com|date=2010-10-07|accessdate=2010-10-11|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010023313/http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/10/gm-prices-volt-home-charger-installation-names-national-installer.html|archivedate=2010-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Volt was not submitted for application to the [[California Air Resources Board]]'s (CARB) [[Clean Vehicle Rebate Project]] rebate and therefore was not required to meet the 10-year {{convert|150,000|mi|km|adj=on}} battery warranty requirement for [[partial zero-emissions vehicle|enhanced advanced technology partial zero-emissions vehicle]]s (enhAT-PZEV).

In February 2012 General Motors began deliveries of a low emission version destined for California that features a new low emissions package that allows the 2012 Chevrolet Volt to qualify as an enhanced, advanced technology –partial zero emissions vehicle (enhAT-PZEV) and have access to California's [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s (HOV).&lt;ref name=HOV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2012/02/24/gm-starts-deliveries-of-2012-hov-lane-eligible-chevy-volts-in-ca/|title=GM starts deliveries of 2012 HOV-lane-eligible Chevy Volts in California |last=King |first=Danny |work=AutoblogGreen |date=2012-02-24|accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new standard California version of the Volt features a modified engine and exhaust components. The [[catalytic converter]] was modified to add a secondary air-injection pump that "''streams ambient air into the exhaust stream to increase its ability to remove pollutants''." Owners of a 2012 Volt with the low emissions package are eligible to apply for one of 40,000 available HOV lane stickers issued to vehicles that qualify as a California AT-PZEV. The permits are handed out on a first-apply, first-served basis. Additionally, the new low emissions package makes the 2012 Volt eligible for owners to receive up to {{USD|1,500}} in state rebates through the state's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP). This incentive is in addition to the federal government's {{USD|7,500}} tax credit.&lt;ref name=PZEV01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/11/16/new-enhat-pzev-chevy-volt-ready-for-california-hov-access-extra/#continued|title=2012 Volt Moves Into California's HOV Fast Lane|work=AutoblogGreen |date=2011-11-16|accessdate=2011-11-17}} ''See details in GM Press Release''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PZEV02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/11/volt-20111117.html|title=Chevy Volt gets a Low Emissions Package for California; HOV lanes access|work=Green Car Congress|date=2011-11-17|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the 2012 Volts manufactured after February 6, 2012, are fitted with the low emission package and sold as standard models in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1071925_can-your-2012-chevy-volt-use-california-hov-lanes-it-depends|title=Can Your 2012 Chevy Volt Use California HOV Lanes?

===== Resale value =====
[[File:Chevy Volt EDTA DC 04 2011 1787.jpg|thumb|left|Production Volts at a test drive event in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

In May 2011 [[Kelley Blue Book]] (KBB) projected the 2011 Chevrolet Volt resale value at just over {{USD|17,000}} after 36 months, the length of a typical lease, which represents 42% of the car's {{USD|41,000}} [[suggested retail price]] (MSRP). KBB explains that even though the residual value seems low, the projection considered that the first 200,000 Volts sold qualified for a {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit, which effectively reduces the MSRP to {{USD|33,500}}, making the {{USD|17,000}}represent 51% of its original value after the tax credit. In comparison, KBB notes, the 2011 Toyota Prius has a projected residual of 46% after 36 months. KBB's estimate assumed a gasoline price around {{USD|4}} per gallon in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2011/05/17/kbb-sets-chevy-volt-resale-value-at-17-000-after-36-months/ |title=KBB sets Chevy Volt resale value at $17,000 after 36 months |author=Automotive News|work=AutoblogGreen|date=2011-05-17|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRresale/&gt; For 2012, Kelley Blue Book expected the Volt to retain 42% of its original value after 3 years and 27% after 5 years. Based on these figures, in November 2011 KBB awarded the Volt with the 2012 Best Resale Value Awards in the [[plug-in electric car]] category.&lt;ref name=KBB2012/&gt; KBB explains that the residual value for the Volt is lower than the market 35.5% average due to the {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit, which lowers the transaction price and pushes down the residual value.&lt;ref name=NYT1116&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/toyota-and-lexus-are-back-on-top-in-kelley-blue-book-resale-value-survey/?ref=automobiles|title=Toyota and Lexus Are Back on Top in Kelley Blue Book Resale Value Survey|author=Cheryl Jensen|work=The New York Times|date=2011-11-16|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consumer Reports]]' analysis show that many Chevrolets lose about half of their purchase price after three years of ownership, and if the Volt depreciates the same, {{USD|17,000}} seems a reasonable estimate. However, Consumer Reports have noted that fuel-efficient hybrids and diesel models often depreciate far less than most vehicles, which might increase the Volt's resale value after three years above the {{USD|17,000}} estimate. Additionally, if gasoline prices continue to rise or if the tax credits expire, the demand for used Chevrolet Volts could quickly increase, raising their market value. On the other hand, if the next-generation Volt's battery has twice the capacity and cost less, as General Motors has claimed, the first generation Volts would be obsolete when the new ones come out in 2015. Considering these assumptions, Consumer Reports said, "At this point we believe it’s still unclear how the Volt will fare."&lt;ref name=CRresale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/05/cheverolet-volts-resale-value-after-three-years-17000.html|title=Chevrolet Volt resale value after three years? $17,000|work=Consumer Reports|date=2011-05-18|accessdate=2011-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522055110/http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/05/cheverolet-volts-resale-value-after-three-years-17000.html|archive-date=2011-05-22|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Pecan Street demonstration project =====
General Motors is sponsoring the [[Pecan Street demonstration project]] at the Mueller neighborhood in [[Austin, Texas]]. The project objective is to learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, which is what the preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. {{As of|2013|06}}, the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's {{USD|7,500}} rebate incentive, which halves the purchase price of the Volt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=remote-control-of-electric-cars|title=Will You or the Grid Control Your Electric Car?|author=David Biello|work=[[Scientific American]]|date=2013-06-18|accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main differences between the Volt and the Ampera are in their styling. The Ampera has a distinctive front and rear [[Fascia (car)|fascia]], with a large cut-out in the rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]].

===End of production===
In 2018, General Motors decided to end production in March 2019. The primary reason given was that the Volt is a sedan, and sales of four-door vehicles were in decline. Car salesmen were proving resistant to selling the car because it was more complicated (and thus took more of their time) to explain how the vehicle operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The range-anxiety associated with all-electric vehicles had been in decline due to better battery technology, and most hybrid drivers were turning on their gas-powered engines less frequently. The battery technology developed for the Volt had already been incorporated into the Bolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The concept shares the same basic plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder [[natural gas]]-powered engine as its [[range extender]] instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model for the next generation of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/frankfurt-motor-show-the-opel-monza-returns/?ref=automobiles&amp;_r=0|title=Frankfurt Motor Show: The Opel Monza Returns|author=Stephen Williams|work=The New York Times|date=2013-09-10|accessdate=2013-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/10/opel-monza-concept-frankfurt-2013/|title=Opel Monza Concept soars into Frankfurt [w/video]|author=Jeffrey N.

== Controversies and criticism ==
=== EPA fuel economy testing ===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Erev PHEVseries 98mpg 500px.jpg|image2=Phev-blended paralell 65mpge 500px.jpg|width=220|caption2=Typical EPA's new [[Fuel economy and environment label|fuel economy label]] for an [[series hybrid|extended-range electric]] vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt (top), and for a blended or [[Series-parallel hybrid|series-parallel]] plug-in hybrid (bottom)}}

In 2008, [[General Motors]] was concerned about how the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) would test the Volt to determine its official [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] rating. The controversy centered on whether, by including a gasoline engine, the Volt should be classified as a [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] rather than an [[electric car]] as claimed by General Motors. If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids, the Volt's EPA fuel economy rating would be around {{Convert|48|mpgus|abbr=on}} due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power. General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle that the EPA's current fuel economy tests are not suited to rate, and that a new test should be devised for this emerging class of hybrid-electrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/080908-Chevy-Volt-100-mpg-or-48-mpg-/|title=Chevy Volt – 100 mpg, or 48 mpg?|date=2008-09-08|work=U.S. News, Rankings and Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method to take into account the range of a plug-in hybrid while running solely on electricity. Because the Volt can travel {{convert|40|mi|km}} on batteries alone, GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode, so long as they recharged their vehicle at work or at home overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.motortrend.com/6293345/government/could-the-epa-cripple-the-chevy-volt/index.html|title=Could the EPA cripple the Chevy Volt?|date=2008-09-05|work=[[Motor Trend]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA official rating issued in November 2010 included separate fuel economy ratings for [[all-electric mode]] and gasoline-only mode, with an overall combined city/highway gasoline-electricity fuel economy rating of {{Convert|60|mpgus|abbr=on}} [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|equivalent]] (MPG-e).&lt;ref name=GCCEPAVolt/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPAmpge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/phevsbs.shtml |title=2011 Chevrolet Volt |website=Fueleconomy.gov |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey2010&gt;{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=David |last2=Krolicki |first2=Kevin |date=2010-11-24 |title=Chevy Volt Tops Prius in Fuel Economy Rating |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AN65K20101124 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges, EPA also included in the Volt's [[fuel economy label]] a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios driven between a full charge, and a never-charge scenario.&lt;ref name=GCCEPAVolt/&gt; According to this table the Volt's fuel economy goes up to {{Convert|168|mpgus|abbr=on}} equivalent (MPG-e) if driven {{Convert|45|mi}} between full charges.&lt;ref name=EPAmpge/&gt; Also, in recognition of the multiple operating modes that a plug-in hybrid can be built with (all-electric, blended, and gasoline-only), for the new [[fuel economy and environment label]] that will be mandatory in the U.S. beginning in [[model year]] 2013, EPA and the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids. One label is for extended-range electric vehicles, like the Chevy Volt, with two modes: all-electric and gasoline-only; and a second label for blended mode that includes a combination of all-electric, gasoline and electric operation, and gasoline only, like a [[hybrid electric vehicle|conventional hybrid vehicle]].&lt;ref name=GCC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/felabel-20110525.html|title=EPA, DOT unveil the next generation of fuel economy labels|work=Green Car Congress|date=2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/carlabel/420f11017.htm|title=Fact Sheet: New Fuel Economy and Environment Labels for a New Generation of Vehicles|author=EPA|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=May 2011|accessdate=2011-05-31}}''EPA-420-F-11-017''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EPA fuel economy rating ===
In August 2009, General Motors released its estimated city [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] rating for the Volt of {{convert|230|mpgUS|abbr=on}} of gasoline plus {{kWh|25}}/100&amp;nbsp;mi (560 kJ/km) of electricity using the EPA's proposed method for evaluating plug-in hybrids.&lt;ref name=NYT230&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/business/12auto.html|title=G.M.

The official EPA rating was issued in November 2010 and became the agency's first [[fuel economy label]] for a [[plug-in hybrid]]s. The EPA rated the 2011 Volt combined fuel economy at 93 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e) in [[all-electric mode]], and {{Convert|37|mpgus|abbr=on}} in gasoline-only mode, for an overall combined fuel economy rating of {{Convert|60|mpgus|abbr=on}} equivalent (MPG-e). The label also shows the combined city-highway fuel economy in all-electric mode expressed in traditional energy consumption units, rating the Volt at 36 {{kWh|link=yes}} per {{Convert|100|mi}}.&lt;ref name=GCCEPAVolt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey2010/&gt;

=== Production cost and sales price ===
In 2009, the [[Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry]] said that "GM is at least one generation behind [[Toyota]] on advanced, “green” powertrain development. In an attempt to leapfrog Toyota, GM has devoted significant resources to the Chevy Volt" and that "while the Chevy Volt holds promise, it is currently projected to be much more expensive than its gasoline-fueled peers and will likely need substantial reductions in [[manufacturing cost]] in order to become commercially viable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Determination of Viability Summary: General Motors Corporation |date=2009-03-30 |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/GM_Viability_Assessment.pdf |accessdate=2009-04-06 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407084946/http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/GM_Viability_Assessment.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2009 [[Carnegie Mellon University]] study found that a [[Plug-in hybrid|PHEV]]-40 will be less cost effective than a [[Hybrid electric vehicle|HEV]] or a PHEV-7 in all of the scenarios considered, due to the cost and weight of the battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cmu.edu/me/ddl/publications/2009-EP-Shiau-Samaras-Hauffe-Michalek-PHEV-Weight-Charging.pdf|title=Impact of battery weight and charging patterns on the economic and environmental benefits of plug-in hybrid vehicles|last1=Shiau|first1=Ching-Shin Norman|last2=Samaras|first2=Constantine|last3=Hauffe|first3=Richard|last4=Michalek|first4=Jeremy J.|journal=Energy Policy|pages=2653–2663|year=2009|volume=37|accessdate=2011-05-22|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2009.02.040 |issue=7}} ''See Figure 6, pp. 2661–2662''&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Lauckner, a Vice President at General Motors, responded that the study did not consider the inconvenience of a {{Convert|7|mi}} [[all-electric range|electric range]] and that the study's cost estimate of {{USD|1,000}} per {{kWh|link=yes}} for the Volt's battery pack was "many hundreds of dollars per [[kilowatt hour]] higher" than what it costs to make today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/03/gm-fights-back-chevy-volt-plug-in-hybrid-battery-cost.php|title=GM Fights Back: Volt Battery Pack "Hundreds Less" than $1,000/({{kWh}}) |work=Treehugger |author=Michael Graham Richard |date=2009-03-04|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, it was reported that General Motors would lose money on the Volt for at least the first couple of generations, but it hoped the car would create a green image that could rival the Prius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gm-exechybrids-unlikely-to-take-more-than-10-of-us-market-2010-02-13|title=GM exec:Hybrids unlikely to take more than 10% of U.S. market|author=Sharon Terlep|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Volt's sales price was announced in July 2010, there was concern expressed of the launch price of the Volt and its affordability and resulting popularity, especially when the federal subsidies of {{USD|2.4 billion}} were taken into account in the development of the car.&lt;ref name=niedermeyer2010&gt;{{cite news |last=Niedermeyer |first=Edward |title=G.M.’s Electric Lemon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/opinion/30neidermeyer.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=electric%20car%20lemon&amp;st=cse |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |at=Opinion |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2010-08-01 |title=Low Voltage |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/31/AR2010073102589.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |at=Editorials |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors CEO [[Edward Whitacre Jr.]] rejected as "ridiculous" criticism that the Volt's price is too expensive. He said that "I think it's a very fair price. It's the only car that will go coast to coast on electricity without plugging it in, and nobody else can come close."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cheersandgears.com/topic/64689-whitacre-talks-to-the-news-about-volt-bailout-critics-more/ |title=Whitacre Talks to The News about Volt, Bailout Critics, More |work=The Detroit News |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the federal government being the major GM shareholder due to the 2009 government-led [[bankruptcy]] of the automaker, during a press briefing at the [[White House]] a [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] official clarified that the federal government did not have any input on the pricing of the 2011 Chevrolet Volt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/volt/2011/white-house-chevy-volt-pricing-decision-didnt-come-from-us.html|title=White House: Chevy Volt Pricing Decision Didn't Come From Us|work=Edmunds.com Inside Line|date=2010-07-30|accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been complaints regarding price markups due to the initial limited availability in 2010 of between {{USD|5,000}} to {{USD|12,000}} above the recommended price,&lt;ref name=NYT080510&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/let-the-chevrolet-volt-buyer-beware-as-some-dealers-mark-up-price/?ref=automobiles|title=Let the Chevrolet Volt Buyer Beware, as Some Dealers Mark Up Price |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Jonathan Schultz|date=2010-08-05|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least in one case a {{USD|20,000}} mark up in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoobserver.com/2010/07/chevrolet-dealer-want-a-volt-thatll-be-an-extra-20k.html|title=Chevrolet Dealer: Want a Volt?

In May 2011 the [[National Legal and Policy Center]] announced that some Chevrolet dealers were selling Volts to other dealers and claiming the {{USD|7,500}} federal tax credit for themselves. Then the dealers who bought the Volts sell them as used cars with low mileage to private buyers, who no longer qualify for the credit. General Motors acknowledged that 10 dealer-to-dealer Volt sales had taken place among Chevrolet dealers, but the carmaker said they do not encourage such practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/over-g-m-s-objections-dealers-sell-used-chevy-volts-without-7500-tax-credit/?ref=automobiles|title=Over G.M.’s Objections, Dealers Sell "Used" Chevy Volts Without $7,500 Tax Credit |author=Mary M.

In September 2012, [[Reuters]] published an opinion/editorial article where it claimed that General Motors, nearly two years after the introduction of the car, was losing {{USD|49,000}} on each Volt it built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maynard |first1=Micheline |title=Stunner: GM May Be Losing $50,000 On Each Chevrolet Volt |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2012/09/10/stunner-gm-may-be-losing-50000-on-each-chevrolet-volt/#1b9a84462cc9 |website=Fobes |publisher=Forbes Media, LLC |accessdate=30 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article concluded that the Volt is "over-engineered and over-priced" and that its technological complexity has put off many prospective buyers, due to fears the car may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GM's Volt: The ugly math of low sales, high costs|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-generalmotors-autos-volt-idUSBRE88904J20120910|work=[[Reuters]] |author1=Bernie Woodall |author2=Paul Lienert |author3=Ben Klayman |date=2012-09-10|accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM executives replied that Reuters' estimates were significantly flawed as they also allocated the vehicle's [[research and development]] program costs only against the number of Volts sold in the United States ({{as of|2012|08|lc=y}}), instead of spreading the total costs over the entire lifetime of the model, as well as including those units sold in Europe and other countries.

[[File:Volt NHTSA fire 01 before &amp; after.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Volt that caught fire after the pole test in June 2011. Top: before the NHTSA's pole test. Below: After the fire.]]

In June 2011 a Volt that had been subjected by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) to a {{convert|20|mph|abbr=on}} side pole impact crash test followed by a post-impact rollover, caught fire three weeks later in the test center parking lot, burning nearby vehicles. The battery was found to be the source of the fire. After the fire, both Chevrolet and the NHTSA independently replicated the crash test and a subsequent vehicle rotation procedure to test for any fluid leakage, but in their first attempt they could not reproduce the conditions under which the battery pack ignited. The NHTSA said it had "concluded that the crash test damaged the Volt’s lithium-ion battery and that the damage led to a vehicle fire that took several weeks to develop."&lt;ref name=Fire5&gt;{{cite web |title=Defect Investigations Results - NHTSA Action Number : PE11037 |url=http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/defects/results.cfm?action_number=PE11037&amp;SearchType=QuickSearch&amp;summary=true |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Safercar.gov |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/11/chevy-volt-fire-prompts-federal-investigation-into-lithium-ion-batteries/?ref=automobiles |title=Chevy Volt Fire Prompts Federal Investigation Into Lithium-Ion Batteries |last=Jensen |first=Christopher |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fire2&gt;{{cite news |last=Green |first=Jeff |last2=Welch |first2=David |last3=Greiling Keane |first3=Angela |date=2011-11-11 |title=GM Volt Fire Prompts Probe of Lithium Batteries |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-11/gm-volt-battery-fire-is-said-to-prompt-u-s-probe-into-electric-car-safety.html |work=Bloomberg |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further testing of the Volt's batteries carried out by NHTSA in November 2011, two of the three tests resulted in thermal events. One battery pack was rotated 180 degrees within hours after it was impacted and began to smoke and emit sparks after rotation. In the other case, the battery pack that was crashed-tested one week earlier and that had been monitored since the test caught fire. The NHTSA then took an uncommon step on November 25, 2011 and opened a formal safety defect investigation "without any data from real-world incidents" to examine the potential risks involved from intrusion damage to the battery pack in the Chevrolet Volt.&lt;ref name=Fire5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/regulators-investigate-chevrolet-volt-battery.html?_r=2&amp;ref=automobiles |title=Formal Defect Inquiry of Volt Battery Begins |last=Bunkley |first=Nick |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=2011-11-25|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/26/us-gm-volt-idUSTRE7AO1SH20111126?type=GCA-GreenBusiness&amp;feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=GCA-GreenBusiness&amp;rpc=43|title=U.S. opening formal probe into GM Volt fire risk |author=Tim Dobbyn|work=[[Reuters]]|date=2011-11-25|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial Volt fire, the NHTSA examined the [[Nissan Leaf]] and other plug-in electric vehicles and said its testing "has not raised safety concerns about vehicles other than the Chevy Volt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/business/tsunami-reveals-durability-of-nissans-leaf.html?_r=1&amp;ref=automobiles|title=Tsunami Reveals Durability of Nissan’s Leaf |last=Bunkley |first=Nick|work=The New York Times|date=2011-12-21|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors explained that the buy back price includes the Volt purchase price, plus taxes and fees, less a usage fee based on how many miles the car has been run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20111205/AUTO01/112050420/1148/GM+says+%E2%80%98couple+dozen%E2%80%99+Volt+owners+seek+repurchase+after+fire+tests |title=GM says 'couple dozen' Volt owners seek repurchase after fire tests |last=Shepardson |first=David |work=The Detroit News |date=2011-12-05|accessdate=2011-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/12/few-dozen-owners-ask-gm-to-buy-back-their-chevrolet-volts/1|title='Few dozen' owners ask GM to buy back their Chevrolet Volts|author=Chrissie Thompson|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2011-12-06|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/chevrolet-volt-wont-lose-top-safety-ratings-during-battery-fire-investigations-143217.html|title=Chevrolet Volt Won’t Lose Top Safety Ratings During Battery Fire Investigations|author=Jake Holmes|work=[[Motor Trend]]|date=2011-12-06|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 5, 2012, GM reported that around 250 Volt owners had requested either a loaner vehicle or a potential buyback.&lt;ref name=ABG010512&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2012/01/05/chevy-volt-will-receive-safety-enhancements-but-dont-call-it-a/|title=Chevy Volt will receive safety enhancements, but don't call it a recall|author=Sebastian Blanco| work=AutoblogGreen| date=2012-01-05| accessdate=2012-01-05}} ''See GM Press Release''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHTSA also said it was working with all automakers to develop postcrash procedures to keep occupants of electric vehicles and emergency personnel who respond to crash scenes safe. Additionally, NHTSA advised to be aware that fires may occur a considerable amount of time after a crash. General Motors said the first fire would have been avoided if GM's protocols for deactivating the battery after the crash had been followed.&lt;ref name=Fire4/&gt; These protocols had been used by GM since July 2011 but were not shared with the NHTSA until November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/buick/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Nov/1128_volt|title= GM Builds on Battery Safety to Ensure Confidence in Chevrolet Volt|work=GM Media News |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=2011-11-28|accessdate=2011-12-01}} ''See the details in the attached file:[http://media.gm.com/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Nov/1128_volt/_jcr_content/rightpar/sectioncontainer_1/par/download/file.res/112811%20Reuss%20Barra%20Volt%20Transcripts.doc112811 Reuss Barra Volt Transcripts.doc Mark Reuss and Mary Barra Volt Conference Call Transcripts]''&lt;/ref&gt; In another statement the carmaker stated that they "are working with other vehicle manufacturers, first responders, tow truck operators, and salvage associations with the goal of implementing industrywide protocols."&lt;ref name=Fire4&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/business/energy-environment/regulators-examine-electric-car-batteries-after-fire.html?_r=1&amp;ref=electricvehicles|title=Batteries in Electric Cars Examined After Chevy Volt Fire|last=Bunkley |first=Nick|work=The New York Times|date=2011-11-11|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customer deliveries of the Opel Ampera in Europe were delayed until the NHTSA completed its investigation of the Volt's battery fire risk to make sure the vehicle is safe.&lt;ref name=EUVolt/&gt; However, deliveries of the first Chevrolet Volts in Europe began in France in November 2011.&lt;ref name=EUVolt/&gt;&lt;ref name=FRAVolt/&gt; Deliveries of the Vauxhall Ampera in the UK continued as scheduled for May 2012.&lt;ref name=EUVolt/&gt; Opel Ampera deliveries began in February 2012.&lt;ref name=AmperaDeliver/&gt;

;Battery enhancements
On January 5, 2012, General Motors announced that it would offer a customer-satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident. The carmaker described the modifications as voluntary enhancements and stated that neither the car nor the battery was being recalled. General Motors determined the June fire was the result of a minor intrusion from a portion of the vehicle into a side section of the battery pack. This intrusion resulted in a small coolant leak inside the battery of approximately {{cvt|50|mL}}. When the vehicle was put through a slow roll, where it was rotated at 90-degree increments, holding in each position for about five minutes, an additional {{convert|1|liter}} of coolant leaked. With the vehicle in the 180 degrees position (upside down), the coolant came in contact with the printed circuit board electronics at the top of the battery pack and later crystallized. Three weeks later this condition, in combination with a charged battery, led to a short circuit that resulted in the post-crash fire.&lt;ref name=NYT010512&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/business/gm-to-reinforce-battery-in-hybrid-car.html?ref=automobiles |title= G.M. to Reinforce Battery in Hybrid Car |last=Bunkley |first=Nick |work= The New York Times |date= 2012-01-05 |accessdate= 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010512&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/volt-20120105.html |title= GM makes modifications to Chevrolet Volt vehicle structure and battery coolant system to further protect from delayed electrical fire after severe crash |work= Green Car Congress |date= 2012-01-05 |accessdate= 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Motors explained the modifications will enhance the vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt's vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket to the top of the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill.&lt;ref name=NYT010512/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010512/&gt; The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of {{cvt|2|to|3|lb|kg}}, and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.&lt;ref name=GCR010512/&gt;

During December 2011, GM conducted four crash tests of Volts with the reinforced steel and upgraded cooling system, resulting in no intrusion to the battery and no coolant leakage. On December 22, 2011, the NHTSA also subjected a modified Volt to the same test that led to the original fire, with no signs of the damage that is believed to have been the cause. The NHTSA said "the preliminary results of the crash test indicate the remedy proposed by General Motors today should address the issue of battery intrusion" though its investigation remained open. General Motors declined to say how much the modifications would cost.&lt;ref name=NYT010512/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC010512/&gt;

All 12,400 Chevrolet Volts produced until December 2011, including all Amperas in stock at European dealerships, were scheduled to receive the safety enhancements. Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements were in place when production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, and dealers modified the Volts they had in stock. General Motors sent a letter to Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012.&lt;ref name=ABG010512/&gt;&lt;ref name=GCR010512&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1071348_chevrolet-to-offer-volt-modifications-against-battery-fire-risk |title= Chevrolet To Offer Volt Modifications Against Battery Fire Risk |last=Voelcker |first=John |work=Green Car Reports |date=2012-01-05 |accessdate= 2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DTN0322&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120322/AUTO0103/203220490/1148/rss25 |title=GM to replace Volt power cords |last=Shepardson |first=David |work=The Detroit News |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2012-03-26 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 Volts sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords.&lt;ref name=DTN0322/&gt;

;NHTSA findings
On January 20, 2012, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed the Volt's safety defect investigation related to post-crash fire risk. The agency concluded that "no discernible defect trend exists" and also found that the modifications recently developed by General Motors are sufficient to reduce the potential for battery intrusion resulting from side impacts. The NHTSA also said that "based on the available data, NHTSA does not believe that Chevy Volts or other electric vehicles pose a greater risk of fire than gasoline-powered vehicles." The agency also announced it has developed interim guidance to increase awareness and identify appropriate safety measures regarding electric vehicles for the emergency response community, law enforcement officers, tow truck operators, storage facilities and consumers.&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind01&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/business/us-finds-no-defect-in-volt.html?_r=1&amp;ref=automobiles |title=In Fire Investigation, Regulators Say They Found No Defect in Volt |last=Bunkley |first=Nick |last2=Vlasic |first2=Bill |work=The New York Times|date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NTHSAfind02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/01/nhtsa-concludes-safety-defect-investigation-into-post-crash-fire-risk-of-the-volt.html |title=NHTSA concludes safety defect investigation into post-crash fire risk of the Volt |work=Green Car Congress |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;House of Representatives hearing

The chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jim Jordan (Ohio politician)|Jim Jordan]] held hearings on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only five months after the first postcrash battery fire occurred in June. The subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wanted to determine if government officials, including from NHTSA, purposely held back information on the Volt fire for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111206/OEM05/111209921|title=House will hold hearings on NHTSA's silence after Volt fire|last=Rogers |first=Christina|work=[[Automotive News]]|date=2011-12-06|accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vlasic |first=Bill |last2=Bunkley |first2=Nick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/business/general-motors-to-re-examine-volts-welded-parts.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Chevrolet%20Volt&amp;st=cse |title=G.M.

The '''Chevrolet Cobalt''' is a [[compact car]] introduced by [[Chevrolet]] in 2004 for the 2005 model year. The Cobalt replaced both the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]] and the [[Toyota]]-based [[Geo/Chevrolet Prizm]] as Chevrolet's compact car. The Cobalt was available as both a [[coupe]] and [[sedan (car)|sedan]], as well as a sport compact version dubbed the [[Cobalt ss|Cobalt SS]]. Like the [[Chevrolet HHR]] and the [[Saturn ION]], it was based on the [[GM Delta platform]]. 

A [[Pontiac]] version was sold in the [[United States]] and Mexico under the G5 name for 2007–2009.  It was sold as the '''Pontiac G4''' in [[Mexico]] for 2005–2006 and as the '''Pontiac G5''' in [[Canada]] for its entire run (where it was briefly known as the '''Pontiac Pursuit''' and later '''Pontiac G5 Pursuit'''). The G5 replaced the Cavalier-related [[Pontiac Sunfire]]. While the Cobalt was available as a 2-door [[coupé|coupe]] and a 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] in all markets it was offered in, the G5 was only available as a coupé in the United States while a sedan version was sold alongside the coupé in Canada and Mexico.

As with their predecessors, all Cobalts and its Pontiac equivalents were manufactured at [[General Motors|GM's]] plant in [[Ramos Arizpe]], Mexico and [[Lordstown, Ohio]]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] classified the Cobalt as a [[subcompact]] car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/FEG/byclass/Subcompact_Cars2008.shtml |title=Gas Mileage of 2008 Subcompact Cars |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date= |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine output was increased to {{convert|155|hp|abbr=on}}.

===Year-to-year changes===
* 2006: A non-[[supercharger|supercharged]] Cobalt [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]] was added to the lineup. This car was equipped with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated [[Ecotec]] [[inline-4]]. The LS became the base model while the LT was marketed as a mid-range package; the top level trim was now the LTZ. In addition, as with most other GM vehicles that year, GM's [[Mark of Excellence]] symbol was added to both front fenders near the doors.
* 2007: Both engines were retuned for more power while retaining the same [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. The 2.2 L Ecotec was now rated at {{Convert|148|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with the 2.4 L Ecotec rated at {{Convert|173|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Other changes include a new console, new steering wheel and new radio head unit that features an audio input jack. In addition, all models except the LS and LT1 now used a 5x110 wheel bolt pattern. The LS and LT1 retained the standard 4x100. In addition, the 2007 model year marked the introduction of a new 32-bit computer that replaced the 16-bit unit from 2006.
* 2008: The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated, high-output SS coupe and SS sedan were renamed to just "Sport Coupe" and "Sport Sedan" respectively. The new Cobalt SS features a {{Convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged engine, replacing the Supercharged engine which was offered from 2005–2007. At mid-year, the fuel economy was increased to {{convert|25|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}5.5–7.5&amp;nbsp;km/liter city, {{convert|36|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}9–11&amp;nbsp;km/lite highway on the LS and 1LT, coupe and sedan models with manual transmission; now labeled with XFE badging (X-tra Fuel Economy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

StabiliTrak stability control system was introduced. Other changes included the adding and removal of several exterior and interior colors. The new SS (turbocharged) coupe launched near the end of May 2008, as it was a facelift from the 2005–2007 version.
* 2008 (Special Edition Package): The special edition package for the Cobalt was introduced on August 16, 2008, which featured all the options that were available on the previous SS models except the turbocharged 2.0 engine. Instead it was once again built with the 2.4 naturally aspirated engine similar to the Cobalt Sport models. The special edition package could come with a sunroof, GM ground effects kit, the Getrag F23 5-speed manual transmission, and additionally the 5 lug wheel bearings that the SS editions featured. The special editions were all had a "Special Edition" badge and came with unique variations of colors, and racing stripes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
* 2009: The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated "Sport Coupe and "Sport Sedan" models were both deleted, along with the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L L61 engine. Both were replaced by the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L LAP engine thus providing better fuel economy and more power, as well an SS sedan being added to the lineup.

===Safety===
According to the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) the Cobalt receives an overall top score of "Good" for front collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=226 |title=IIHS-HLDI: 2005–08 Chevrolet Cobalt – FRONTAL OFFSET TEST |publisher=Iihs.org |date=November 5, 2010 |accessdate=January 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AEmXwpRf?url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=226 |archive-date=August 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IIHS also found 2005-08 model year Cobalts had the highest fatality rate in the small 4 door car class, with 117 deaths per million registered years compared to its class average of 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4605.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611061533/http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4605.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defects and recalls===
In early 2007, 98,000 Cobalt coupes from the 2005–06 model years were recalled after it was discovered they did not meet federal safety requirements because of a lack of adequate padding in a specific area of the vehicle's trim. This resulted in an unacceptable vulnerability to head injuries, though GM claimed the vulnerability would only affect motorists not wearing a seat belt.&lt;ref&gt;

On March 2, 2010, GM announced a recall of 1.3 million compact cars in North America, including the Chevrolet Cobalt, because of [[power steering]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]] (March 2, 2010). [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6210IQ20100302?feedType=nl&amp;feedName=usmorningdigest "GM recalling 1.3 million vehicles over steering problems"]. Retrieved 2010-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; GM implemented the repair on older models before fixing more recent models, as the car was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Cruze]] in late 2010. The [[Pontiac G5]] and its international variants were also affected, though GM had already ended production of the [[Pontiac]] brand by that point.

On September 28, 2012, GM announced a recall of 40,859 cars including the Chevrolet Cobalt from the 2007-09 model year because of a potential fuel leak.  Although the recall was limited to five states, vehicles from other southern states were covered for repair when summer heat caused cracks in the fuel reservoir assembly.  The fuel vapor leak could be detected during hot days by a gasoline smell in the vicinity of the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2012/09/29/general-motors-recall/1602747/|title=GM recalls 40,859 cars for potential fuel leaks|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=September 28, 2012|date=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulty ignition switches in the Cobalts, which cut power to the car while in motion, were eventually linked to many crashes resulting in fatalities, starting with a teenager in 2005 who drove her new Cobalt into a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tim Higgins and Nick Summers |title=If only they had listened - HOW A GM LIFER SPENT YEARS TRYING TO WARN THE COMPANY, AND HOW IT SILENCED HIM |date=June 23, 2014 |work=Time Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20190110072639/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53c058b5e4b0162bd931986b/t/59cbf608017db240995b9b43/1506539045549/GM.pdf "If only they had listened - HOW A GM LIFER SPENT YEARS TRYING TO WARN THE COMPANY, AND HOW IT SILENCED HIM"] The switch continued to be used in the manufacture of the vehicles even after the problem was known to GM.&lt;ref name="money.cnn"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/28/autos/gm-recall-timeline/index.html GM recall was delayed by internal miscues] [[CNN Money]], February 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On February 21, 2014, GM recalled over 700,000 Cobalts for issues traceable to the defective ignition switches.  In May 2014 the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches.

===Pontiac G5===
The Pontiac G5 was a rebadged version of the Chevrolet Cobalt.

The Pontiac Pursuit was originally introduced in Canada as a sedan in 2005. The Pontiac Pursuit was only available as a sedan and was only sold in Canada from 2005 to 2006. In 2006, another version of the vehicle was released called the Pontiac G5 Pursuit in Canada, but it was now available as both a sedan and a coupe. This vehicle was available as both a sedan and coupe also in Mexico as the Pontiac G4 from 2005 to 2006.

In the United States, the Pontiac G5 went on sale in 2006 as a 2007 model, serving as the replacement for the Pontiac Sunfire. The Pontiac G5 in the United States was only available as a coupe. However, in Canada, and in Mexico, the Pontiac G5 went on sale in early 2007 as a 2007 model, available as both a sedan and coupe.

General Motors discontinued the Pontiac G5 in the United States in 2009. One year later in 2010, General Motors discontinued the Pontiac G5 in both Canada and Mexico. The G5 was discontinued as a direct result of General Motors phasing out the Pontiac brand in 2010. In the United States and in Mexico, the Chevrolet Cruze had replaced both Chevrolet Cobalt and the Pontiac G5. The [[Buick Verano]] had replaced the Pontiac G5 in Canada.

===Replacement===
{{main|Chevrolet Cruze}}
In 2009, Chevrolet launched the Cobalt's eventual successor, the [[Chevrolet Cruze]] (based on the new [[Delta II platform]]), in Europe, with launches in other markets (including the US) following in 2010. The Cobalt ended production on June 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/06/gm_taking_some_unusual_risks_i.html |title=GM taking some unusual risks in bringing its Chevrolet Cruze small car to market |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand by GM in 2010, the [[Buick Verano]] is marketed as the G5's successor in Canada, while the Cruze serves as a [[de facto]] replacement for the [[Pontiac G5]] in America.

In 2011, [[General Motors Brazil]] introduced a new model bearing the Cobalt name in the Brazilian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All New 2012 Chevrolet Cobalt Revealed in Production Form, will be Available in 40 Countries|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2011/11/brand-new-2012-chevrolet-cobalt.html|publisher=Carscoops|accessdate=April 14, 2016|date=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Cobalt replaced the aging local [[Chevrolet Viva|Chevrolet Astra]]. The car is equipped with a 1.4 Econo.Flex engine. Although sporting a similar front end style, it is not directly related to the [[Chevrolet Agile]], since it shares the overall underpinnings with the 2011 [[Chevrolet Sonic]],&lt;ref name="quatrorodas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/testes/chevrolet-cobalt-ltz-1-4-8v-646041.shtml |title=Testes: Chevrolet Cobalt LTZ 1.4 8V - Quatro Rodas |publisher=quatrorodas.abril.com.br |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603072909/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/testes/chevrolet-cobalt-ltz-1-4-8v-646041.shtml |archive-date=June 3, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  while the Agile is derived from the considerably older [[Opel Corsa#Corsa B (1993–2000)|Opel Corsa B]], from 1993.

Chevrolet had no plans to bring the Cobalt to the [[North American]] market, which already had the [[Chevrolet Sonic]] and [[Chevrolet Spark]] as the [[subcompact cars]] in the continent. In GM Brazil's line-up, it is situated above the [[Chevrolet Prisma]] and below the [[Chevrolet Cruze]].

In January 2013, the Cobalt was launched in the Russian market, where it was imported from Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="wardsauto"&gt;http://wardsauto.com/industry/uzbek-gm-plant-prepares-cobalt-exports-russia&lt;/ref&gt; There, it was offered with a 1.5-litre engine, producing {{convert|105|PS|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|134|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.autostat.ru/news/view/7483/&lt;/ref&gt; The Cobalt was retired in Russia in December 2015, when Chevrolet decided to minimise its presence only to its iconic models.  However, in late 2016, it was reintroduced under the new [[GM Uzbekistan|Ravon]] marque as the '''Ravon R4'''&lt;ref name="wroom" /&gt;.

The Cobalt received a facelift in late 2015 for the 2016 model year.&lt;ref&gt;http://g1.globo.com/carros/noticia/2015/12/chevrolet-cobalt-reestilizado-custara-partir-de-r-52690.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its main rivals are the [[Nissan Versa]] and the [[Renault Logan]].&lt;ref name="quatrorodas"/&gt;

In Brazil, production ended in late 2019, with 2020 being the final model year.  The Cobalt has been succeeded by the [[Chevrolet Onix|Chevrolet Onix Plus]] sedan, which achieved higher sales upon its launch in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/03/gm-brazil-officially-ended-production-of-the-chevrolet-cobalt/|title=GM Brazil Officially Ended Production Of The Chevrolet Cobalt|publisher=GM Authority|date=2020-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna ''' is a mid-sized automobile produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1973 through 1976 [[model year]]s.  Part of the GM [[GM A platform|A-Body]] platform, the 1973 Laguna series  included coupes, sedans and station wagons. It was the top-line [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] series that year positioned above the [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]]. For 1974 through 1976 the car was produced as a one-model Laguna S-3 coupe, the new-for-1974 Malibu Classic series taking the top-luxury series position. All Lagunas sported urethane front-ends which easily distinguished them from other Chevelles. NASCAR driver [[Cale Yarborough]] earned the first two of his three consecutive [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup]] championships piloting a Chevelle Laguna.

==History==

===Overview===
The 1973–1976 Chevelle Lagunas accounted for 108,815 of nearly 1.7 million third generation Chevelle sales. Production included 42,941 1973 Laguna coupes, and 38,790 1974–1976 Laguna Type S-3 coupes, making them relatively rare cars in today's collector market.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrolet honored California beach resorts again by naming the top 1973 Chevelle series "Laguna" with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply "Deluxe". Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored urethane front end concealing the new [[5 mph bumper|5&amp;nbsp;mph bumper]] system. On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock-absorbing cylinders, deflected and rebounded; Laguna models also featured a specific [[die casting|diecast]] chrome [[grille]] with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]], front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel-opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Laguna interiors were more lavish than the Malibu in pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.&lt;ref&gt;1973 chevrolet brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1973 Chevelle Laguna "Colonnade" hardtop featured a semi-[[fastback]] roofline with styled "B" pillars, frameless door glass and distinctive rear quarter glass on two-door [[coupe]]s. New side windows with styled center pillars were featured on four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] models. 
The new-design B pillars were structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety in a roll-over type accident. GM had anticipated federal roll-over safety standards for January 1974 that  did not materialize. The unusually thin windshield pillars contributed to the much-improved visibility over the previous generation Chevelles. Two Laguna [[station wagons]] were introduced, including a Laguna [[Woodie (car body style)|estate]]. The wagons, available in six- or nine-passenger seating, featured a counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easy entry and loading up to {{convert|85|cuft|m3}}.&lt;ref name='MT73'&gt;Motor Trend 1973 Buyers Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

===New chassis===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1973 Chevy Chevelle Chassis.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Chevelle - new chassis]] --&gt;
The new top of the line Laguna shared with all 1973 Chevelles the most extensive redesign in their 10-year history The chassis were as new as the bodies -[[wheelbase]] dimensions were a sporty 112&amp;nbsp;inches for coupes and 116&amp;nbsp;inches for sedans and station wagons on an all-new sturdier [[perimeter frame]] with increased front and rear suspension travel, larger, 8½&amp;nbsp;inch, rear axle, wider, six-inch, wheel rims, refined rear control arm bushings and new shock absorber locations, new body mounts and improved front suspension geometry&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet engineering report-73 Chevelle&lt;/ref&gt; - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive [[camber angle|camber]] than the right which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruising stability. Clearances for spring travel were improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the [[coil spring]]s at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Power brakes with front [[disc brake]] calipers were standard on all 1973 Chevelles.

Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style outside door handles, molded full foam front- and rear-seat construction, a flow-through power ventilation system, an inside hood release, a refined Delcotron generator and a sealed side-terminal battery, a larger, 22 gallon, fuel tank, and "flush and dry" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. Another structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. Options included swiveling Strato-[[bucket seats]] (with console) for coupes, a power moonroof, and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster.&lt;ref&gt;1973–1977 Chevrolet Chevelle brochures&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While lesser Chevelles (except the Malibu SS option) came standard with either a 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder or a 307-cubic-inch two-barrel V8, Lagunas came standard with a 145-horsepower 350-cubic-inch two-barrel V8. Options included a 350 four-barrel V8 of {{Convert|175|hp}} and a 454 four-barrel V8 rated at {{Convert|245|hp}}. Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic [[camshafts]] made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. A three-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard; four-speed manual and [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] three-speed automatic were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs that prevented air from entering the system prevented overheating.&lt;ref name='73brochure'&gt;1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
[[File:Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna Colonnade Hardtop Coupe 1973.jpg|thumb|1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna Colonnade hardtop coupe]]
''Speed and Supercar'' magazine said in a June 1973 "Street Test": "Chevy gets it right on." "Enough is plenty, that's how we feel about the ('73) 350 Laguna. "...&amp;nbsp;We couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell you what a groovy all around car it is even if it can't smoke the quarter-mile run in 13 seconds. And what car in '73 can." "It's not overpowering but it's enough - and so comfortable that the editor bought the car." "The Laguna is the type of car you want to own for fast, comfortable transportation in quiet luxury."&lt;ref&gt;Speed and Supercar-June 1973: Driving impression 350 Laguna&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Motor Trend]]'' - "1973 Buyers Guide" said: "Chevrolet is fielding an all-new intermediate Chevelle series at a time when competitive lines from [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]] are one or more years old...when you look at what the stylists have done with what we used to call the pillar coupe, you might want to rush out and buy some stock in General Motors."

''Motor Trend'' said: "The [[Pontiac Grand Am#1973–1975|Grand Am]] and the Laguna are large "small" cars. Nimble, quick and responsive."
"The cleanly styled Laguna has a lot to recommend it. The car has a very tight feeling, a by-product of the heavily ribbed underbody and double paneled roof. Strongly in the Laguna's favor is the integrated, body-colored urethane bumper-front end. It's a lot better looking out-front than the big bumper approach."

''[[Car and Driver]]'' said: "[[Directional stability]] is so strong on the highway that the Laguna seems locked on some guidance-beam radiated from your destination." 
"The Laguna's urethane nose cap allows the front end to be flat and free of gaps in this day of jutting bumpers; its block-cut fenders are chauvinistically masculine and no sheet metal is wasted cloaking its tires from view...so the Laguna looks like it could bowl over most of the cars on the road.

===1974–1976 Laguna Type S-3===
[[File:1976 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna Type S-3 Coupe (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|1976 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna Type S-3 coupe]]
For 1974, the Laguna was renamed "Laguna Type S-3" and was offered only as the Colonnade coupe. It retained the urethane front end from 1973 with a revised grille and new parking lamps, augmented at the rear by new [[taillights]]. A federally-mandated {{Convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} chrome rear bumper replaced the body-colored steel {{Convert|2.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} version from 1973. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with horizontal ribs; body side striping, Laguna S3 badging, as well as firmer shocks and springs, a front [[stabilizer bar]], and HR70x15 [[radial tires]] on [[Rally wheels]]. Front occupants rode in swivel bucket seats, and the driver faced a six-dial instrument cluster and a four-spoke, sport steering wheel. The 1974 Laguna S-3 had replaced the discontinued "SS" as the performance option on the Chevelle. Production totaled 15,792 cars, with prices starting at $3,723 - and plenty of options to send the bottom line past $5,000. Engine offerings included a standard {{Convert|145|hp}} 350 two-barrel V8, with optional powerplants including a {{Convert|150|hp}} 400 two-barrel V8, {{Convert|175|hp}} 400 four-barrel V8 and {{Convert|235|hp}} 454 four-barrel V8, except in California where a {{Convert|155|hp}} 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 400 and 454 engines were optional. Turbo Hydra-matic transmission was standard with a four-speed manual available only with the 454 engine. Horsepower was seemingly lower due to the way it was calculated as 'net' starting in 1972 as opposed to 'gross' horsepower ratings of 1971 and prior years.

The 1975 Laguna S-3 was introduced mid-year in January 1975. This time, it had a slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose designed for [[NASCAR]] (which later resurfaced again in 1983 with the Monte Carlo SS) and louvered opera windows. The Colonnade designation was dropped. The vinyl half-roof, swiveling Strato-bucket front seats with center console, as well as the four-spoke sport steering were no longer standard S-3 equipment, and were made optional in mid-1974 to reduce the car's base price.  The 454 engine option was available for the first half of the model year in the Chevelle and thus the 1975 Laguna had the 400 as the top engine. The 49-states' engine line-up was - the standard 145-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8, the optional 175-horsepower 400 four-barrel V8, and the 215-horsepower 454  four-barrel V8. In California, a 155-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 180-horsepower 400 four-barrel V8 was the only engine option. All 1975 models included the newly introduced [[catalytic converter]]. The Turbo Hydra-matic three-speed automatic was the only transmission offered as manual transmissions were discontinued. Options included an Econominder gauge package, during the gasoline shortage of the mid-seventies.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1976 Chevelle Laguna S-3.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Chevelle Laguna S-3]] --&gt;
In its third and final year, the 1976 Laguna Type S-3 again featured a sloped, body-color urethane front end and quarter-window louvers, but with new rear styling and horizontal taillights shared with other Chevelles. Lagunas shared their round-gauge instrument panel with the personal-luxury [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]]; Malibu models made do with a more conventional dashboard and a linear-readout speedometer. The standard engine was a new 140-horsepower 305 two-barrel V8. Optional engines included the 145-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 and 175-horsepower 400 four-barrel V8. Aero styling had helped make the Laguna popular with NASCAR drivers. The Laguna S3 was outsold by the Malibu Classic coupe and the Monte Carlo. Production of the Laguna edged up to 9,100 cars as the base price went to $4,621.

==NASCAR==

[[File:NASCAR Chevelle Laguna- -11.jpg|thumb|Cale Yarborough's No. 11 Chevelle Laguna]]
The third generation Chevelle was an extensively used body style in NASCAR competition from 1973 to 1977.  The Chevelle Laguna S-3 in particular was extremely successful.  Its sloped nose, small rear quarter windows and "fastback-style" rear glass gave it an aero advantage over other GM body styles at NASCAR's fastest tracks.  Junior Johnson's team, with driver Cale Yarborough, won 34 races and earned the first two of three consecutive [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup]] championships. Considered a limited edition "aero" model by NASCAR, the Laguna S-3 was made ineligible for competition following the 1977 season. The Laguna was so fast that Nascar required the cars be fitted with 'restrictor plates' to effectively slow them down when no other cars had this requirement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

''Motor Trend'' said in 1973: "While neither Chevrolet or [[Pontiac]] are back in racing, the new crop intermediates out of GM's styling studios are curiously [[aerodynamic]]. They are also curiously competing on the NASCAR circuit tracks, and selling as fast as they can be hauled to the dealerships."

===Highlights===
Third generation Chevelle NASCAR Winston Cup highlights:

March 25, 1973: Southeastern 500-Cale Yarborough, back in NASCAR's fold after a two-year exile in USAC Indy Cars, drives [[Junior Johnson]]'s No. 11 Chevrolet Chevelle to an overwhelming victory in the [[Southeastern 500]] at Bristol. Yarborough leads all 500 laps.

July 8, 1973: Volunteer 500-Points leader [[Benny Parsons]] drives his unsponsored Chevelle to an impressive win in the [[Volunteer 500]] at [[Bristol International Speedway]]. Parsons finishes seven laps ahead of runner-up [[L.D. Ottinger]].

September 23, 1973: Wilkes 400-[[Bobby Allison]] runs down [[Richard Petty]] on the final lap to win the Wilkes 400 at North Wilkesboro Speedway. It was Allison's second win of the season in his No. 12 Chevelle.

October 21, 1973: [[1973 American 500|American]] 500-Benny Parsons pits for repairs after an early crash. The help of several teams allow him to get back into the race and finish 28th. Parsons and his Chevelle hold on to win the NASCAR [[Winston Cup]] Grand National championship. Parsons took the points lead with a third-place finish at [[Talladega Speedway]] in early May and never gave up the lead. He held off a late rally by Cale Yarborough to win by only 67.15 points.

July 14, 1974: Volunteer 500-Cale Yarborough muscles his way around [[Buddy Baker]] on the final lap and squeezes out a narrow win in Bristol's Volunteer 500. It is the seventh win of the season for Yarborough and his No. 11 Chevelle.

February 16, 1975: Daytona 500-Benny Parsons takes the lead three laps from the finish and wins the [[Daytona 500]] when leader [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]] spins on the backstretch. Parsons Chevelle comes from the 32nd starting position to claim the upset win and the biggest victory of his career.

May 10, 1975: [[1975 Music City USA 420|Music City USA 420]]-[[Darrell Waltrip]] racks up his first career NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National victory in his No. 17 Laguna with a two-lap triumph in the Music City USA 420 at his hometown [[Nashville Speedway USA|Nashville Speedway]]. Benny Parsons finishes second in his Chevelle.

August 1976: Cale Yarborough drives his No. 11 Junior Johnson/Holly Farms Chevelle to the 1976 NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National championship. Yarborough won nine races along the way to the first of three consecutive titles. He finished last in the Daytona 500, but assumed command of the points chase in August. Yarborough beat Richard Petty by 195 points.

February 20, 1977: Daytona 500-Cale Yarborough's Chevelle pulls away from Benny Parsons' Chevelle in the final laps to win his second Daytona 500. Yarborough was running at the finish in all 30 NASCAR Winston Cup races as he dominated the 1977 season to wrap up his second consecutive title. Yarborough won nine races in 30 starts in his No. 11 Chevelle and finished 386 points ahead of runner-up Richard Petty.&lt;ref&gt;1973–77 Nascar recap by the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fifth-generation Chevrolet Impala''' were [[full-size car|full-sized]] [[automobile]]s produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1971 through 1976 [[model year]]s and was one of GM's top-selling models throughout the 1970s. Models included a sport coupe using a semi-fastback roofline shared with other B-body GM cars, custom coupe with the formal roofline from the Caprice, four-door sedan, four-door hardtop sport sedan, and a convertible,  - each of which rode on a new 121.5-inch wheelbase and measured 217&amp;nbsp;inches overall. Station wagons rode on a longer 125-inch wheelbase.

==History==

===Overview===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1971 Impala - Caprice promo.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Chevrolet promo]] --&gt;
The 1971 redesigned [[B-body]] would be the largest car ever offered by Chevrolet. All 1971 Chevrolet engines featured lower [[compression ratio]]s to permit the use of regular leaded, low lead or unleaded gasoline of at least 91 Research [[octane]] per GM corporate mandate in anticipation of the [[catalytic converter]]s planned for 1975 and later models which necessitated the use of unleaded fuel.  A high-performance big block V8 was available in the form of the Turbo-Jet 454, which produced 365&amp;nbsp;hp in 1971, but power decreased as the years went along. The 1970s marked the impact of the 1973 [[energy crisis]] with gasoline prices doubling from 1973 through 1979 and industry car sales plummeted 20 percent between 1973 and 1974. For the first time in recent history, annual passenger car travel in the U.S. declined. The Impala's sales dropped to 176,376 units in 1975, the weakest since its introduction in 1958.  An Econominder gauge package was offered for 1975 and 1976 models.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971===

1971 Impala models offered the same body styles as previous years. Newly standard features included power front [[disc brakes]], inside hood release, and a revised Astro-Ventilation system that utilized air distribution grills in the trunklid. The new body featured a double panel roof for improved rollover protection and flush exterior door handles - both features previously introduced on the 1970½ [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]].

[[File:71 Impala Sport Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Impala Sport Coupe]]

Optional engines included the 255-horsepower 400 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 (the standard Caprice and Kingswood Estate engine), 300-horsepower 400 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8 and 365-horsepower 454 cubic-inch V-8. Early in the model year, all Impalas came standard with three-speed column shift manual transmissions and manual steering as standard equipment, with power steering and one of two [[automatic transmission]]s optional. During the first months of the model year, the three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] automatic transmission was optional with all engines while the two-speed [[Powerglide]] could be ordered with the 250 6 or 350 V-8s. At mid-year the Turbo-Hydramatic and variable-ratio power steering became standard equipment on all V-8 powered full-sized Chevrolets.

Station wagons featured a 'clamshell' design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), dropped below the load floor. The power tailgate, the first of its kind, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate which required marked effort to lift from storage. This design was shared with other full-sized GM wagons from Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick. Subsequent generations reverted to the door-gate style for its full-size wagons. As expected, 1971 Impala production was well below 1970 totals due to the 67-day corporate wide [[strike action|strike]] at General Motors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/19/business/memories-glory-gm-strike-recalls-era-when-cars-were-big-so-was-union-power.html|title=Memories of Glory; G.M. Strike Recalls Era When Cars Were Big, and So Was Union Power|last=Greenhouse|first=Steven|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that began in September, 1970 after initial 1971-model production began and would not end until November. Impala production ended up at 427,000 units including 2,300 with six-cylinder engines and 425,400 with V8 with other series production totals including Caprice, 91,300; Biscayne, 37,600; Bel Air, 20,000; and station wagons (all series), 91,300.

===1972===
[[File:Chevrolet Impala 1972 (14106775621).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Chevrolet Impala Sport Sedan]]

The 1972 Impala introduced a lower height [[grille]] which extended below the bumper and revised taillights now set in the bumper. 
1972 saw the last Impala convertible, the following year moving to the top-of-the-line [[Chevrolet Caprice Classic|Caprice Classic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/sports/2012/05/the-complete-history-of-the-chevrolet-impala/1972|title=The Complete History of the Chevrolet Impala1972|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Impala [[ragtop]] sold 6,456 units, placing fourth with just under 9% of the market, right behind the [[Chevrolet Corvette C3|Corvette]] 6,508, ahead of the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]]'s 6,401.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p. 865.&lt;/ref&gt; Total Impala production for 1972 ended up at 597,500 units and other series totals included Caprice, 178,500; Biscayne (in its final year), 20,500; Bel Air, 41,900; and station wagons, 171,700.&lt;ref&gt;3rd Edition Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1946-75, pg. 171&lt;/ref&gt; The 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine was offered in Impala four-door sedans and sport coupes along with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] and manual steering at the very beginning of the model year with 1,500 Impala sixes built. After the short run of early-1972 six-cylinder Impalas were built in the fall of 1971, the six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual transmission were relegated to low-line Biscayne and Bel Air sedans. For most the 1972 model year, all Impalas were V-8 powered and came standard with Turbo Hydramatic transmission, power steering and power front disc brakes. The standard Impala engine was now the 165-net 350-cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8 with optional engines including the 170-horsepower, 400-cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 (the base Caprice/Kingswood Estate engine), 240-horsepower, 400-cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8 (rated at 215 horsepower on station wagons) or the 270-horsepower, 454-cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8 – these were the engine offerings in 49 states; in California the only engines offered were the 165-horsepower 350 and 170-horsepower 400 Turbo Fire small-block V8s due to that state's much stricter emission regulations. The Astro Ventilation system was redesigned for 1972 with the vents relocated from the trunk lid to the doorjambs for improved reliability and efficiency over the troublesome 1971 system that was a major source of complaints from owners to Chevrolet and its dealers.

===1973===
[[File:1973 Impala.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Impala Custom Coupe]]
1973 Impalas featured a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required {{convert|5|mph|adj=on}} impact protection. The chassis was tweaked for better roadability, and new square taillights were mounted in the carry-over rear bumper. With the convertible now moved to the top-line Caprice Classic series, (continuing through 1975) Impalas were now all closed body styles for the first time in the nameplate's history and the station wagon known as the Kingswood since 1969 rejoined the Impala series. A 145-horsepower 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 engine, Turbo Hydramatic transmission, variable ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were standard on all Impalas. Optional engines in all models included a 175-horsepower 350 Turbo Fire V8 with four-barrel carburetor and 245-horsepower 454 Turbo Jet V8; while the Impala Custom coupe, Sport Sedan and station wagons could be ordered with the 165-horsepower 400 Turbo Fire V8 that was standard on that year's Caprice Classic series. All engines were offered nationwide in 1973.

===1974===

For 1974, the rear bumper of Impalas and other full-sized Chevrolets incorporated shock absorbing cylinders to meet the upgraded [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper standards]] with new [[taillights]] above the bumper, separated by the license plate and fuel filler. The front end featured a new grille and headlight bezels, a new header panel, and a bumper with a drop down center section.  The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps.

[[File:Flickr - DVS1mn - 74 Chevrolet Impala Spirit of America Edition.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Impala Sport Coupe Spirit of America Limited edition]]

A limited-edition '''Spirit of America''' package was offered in 1974 on Sport Coupe models; primarily an appearance package, it featured white body paint, a white full [[vinyl top]], white upholstery with red or blue trim, color-keyed seat belts and floormats, special wheel covers, optional white [[rally wheels]], sports-styled dual remote outside rear view mirrors, a vinyl body side molding insert, and red pin-striping. Special fender and dashboard badges announced the package to passers-by and  passengers.

This was the only year of the 1971–1976 models the Impala had a different front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two. 
The rooflines of the Impala coupes were revised. For 1974 the Custom Coupe was no longer a [[hardtop]], with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B-pillar.  The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down quarter glass like that of the 1971-73 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, [[fastback]] style, flat back window similar to the 1966-68 Caprice coupes. The four-door sedan, four-door hardtop Sports Sedan and station wagons used carryover rooflines from 1973.

Engine offerings included the standard 145-horsepower 350 Turbo Jet V-8 on sedans and coupes, optional 150- and 180-horsepower 400 Turbo Fire V8s (the latter standard on Impala wagons), and 235-horsepower 454 Turbo Jet V8. In California, a 155-horsepower 350 V-8 with four-barrel [[carburetor]] was standard and the only engine options there were the 180-horsepower 400 and 454 V-8s.

===1975===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1975 Impala.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Impala 4Dr. Sedan]] --&gt;
The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice model carried a new front end with a swept back style header panel with recessed headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the radio and climate control graphics. Speedometers read up to {{convert|100|mph}}, and added kilometers per hour. 1975 officially debuted a high-energy (HEI) [[electronic ignition]] system. [[Catalytic converters]] were also introduced as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package, intermittent wipers, and a divided 50-50 bench seat (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim).

A '''Landau''' appearance package was new for 1975. It featured an elk-grained [[landau]] [[vinyl roof]] (with a chrome band across the roof), a choice of special paint colors, sports-styled dual remote outside rearview mirrors, color-keyed wheel covers, a vinyl bodyside molding insert, and pin-striping. Inside were color-keyed seat belts and floormats; fender and dashboard emblems rounded out the package. (An identical trim package was also sold on the Caprice model.) Sport Coupe models were discontinued after the 1975 model year, leaving the redesigned Custom Coupe, with its wide "B" pillar and fixed rear window, the only 2-door Impala available in 1976. Engine offerings were similar to 1974 except that the 400 Turbo Fire V-8 was now only offered in four-barrel 180-horsepower form and the 454 Turbo Jet V-8 was no longer offered in California.

===1976===
[[File:A92 (24193061739).jpg|thumb|left|1976 Impala 4-door sedan]]
The 1976 Impala used a previous year Caprice nose, with a new "egg crate" grille insert. The Impala had round headlamps while the Caprice used the new quad rectangular ones. Engine offerings were the same as 1975 in both 49-state and California offerings. This was the final year for the four-door hardtop sedan, the big block 454 V-8 now yielding 225 horsepower, and the station wagon clamshell tailgate.
The pillarless Impala Sport Coupe faded out of the lineup; a formal-roof Custom Coupe was the only Impala two-door. After 1976, the four-door hardtop body style also would disappear. Measuring more than 222&amp;nbsp;inches overall on a 121.5-inch [[wheelbase]], the  Impala ranked as the last of truly big Chevys. Full-size cars made the most of their [[perimeter frame]] and full [[coil spring]] suspension to deliver a smooth ride.
The interior had such luxuries as simulated rosewood vinyl trim on the instrument panel, steering wheel, and doors. Impalas rode steel-belted [[radial tires]] and carried an automatic transmission, power brakes, and variable-ratio power steering. The standard bench seat could be replaced by a 50/50 split front seat, as in 1975. The Landau model, for both Caprice and Impala, continued into 1976 as before. A lighted visor vanity mirror was new to the options list.

A lower-priced Impala "S" series, available only as a four-door sedan, was introduced this year for the United States market and functioned as a replacement for the Bel Air, which was dropped after the 1975 model year. The trim and standard features were similar to that of the departed Bel Air series (although this model used the same triple rear taillights as the regular Impala, unlike the twin-taillight setup of the Bel Air). The Impala "S" was sold primarily to fleet and government customers where luxury was not a concern, although the car was available for purchase by private customers who sought basic low-cost transportation with the convenience of a V-8 powered full-size automobile.

The '''Chevrolet 400''' was a [[compact car]] made by [[Chevrolet]] in [[Argentina]] from 1962 to 1974. The "400" was [[General Motors]]'s reply to [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]] after those companies introduced the first [[compact car]]s to Argentina, the [[Ford Falcon (Argentina)|Ford Falcon]] and [[Plymouth Valiant#1960.E2.80.931962|Valiant II]] respectively.

The "400" was based on the Chevrolet model known in [[United States]] as [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevy II]] (and later "Chevrolet Nova"). Only the 4-door sedan version was manufactured in the country, although U.S. versions included a complete line of body styles, including a [[Hardtop#Pillarless hardtops|hardtop coupe]], convertible coupe, [[Sedan (automobile)|2-door sedan]], and [[station wagon]].

==History==

===  The Beginning===
[[File:Chevrolet 400 Picando.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet 400 accelerating in the [[Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez]]]]
[[File:Chevrolet 400 1962.jpg|thumb|1962 Chevrolet 400]]
[[File:Chevrolet 400 Super 230 1967 (8100643878).jpg|thumb|right|1967 Chevrolet 400 in the streets]]

In the 1960s, the auto industry was revolutionized with the emergence of a new concept vehicle: the [[compact car]]. In Argentina, a radical change occurred in the structures of large factories, such that Chrysler began to manufacture the "Valiant II" while [[Ford]] produced the "Falcon".

[[General Motors]]'s response was a car derived from the U.S. market, the [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevy II]], traded as "Chevrolet 400" in Argentina. The first version of the 400 included round headlights on its front grille and was equipped with Chevrolet's ubiquitous overhead-valve, six-cylinder engine of 194 cubic inches or 3179 cc.

===Chevrolet 400 Argentina===
The first Chevrolet 400 was manufactured on March 21, 1962. As cited above the car was equipped with an engine named "194" which had a displacement of 194 cubic inches (or 3179 cc). The 400 was offered in two models: the "Special" which was a luxury sedan and the "Base", most of which were used as [[taxi]]. Its engine came equipped with a single-barrel Rochester BC carburetor, while the Special had a [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]]. Both engines had 106 HP. The models came with a 3-speed manual transmission.

In 1964, GM released the "Super", which showed a slight touch up on its front portion showing a whole new grill. The Super premiered the new inline "230" six-cylinder engine (3769 cc), 127 HP and a Holley R2751 carburetor, and equipped with 3-speed manual transmission as usual.

In 1967 Chevrolet launched the 400 "Super Sport", the most aggressive version of the line that featured a more powerful engine and an innovative gearbox. These had the 250 cubic-inch OHV Six, and ZF 4-speed selector with trigger shifter, released just this year. The Super Sport, equipped with this engine-box duo, produced 155 HP. It also came equipped with a 2-barrel Holley RX 7214-A carburetor. It also brought updated front-end styling with quad round headlights.

That same year, racer Carlos Alberto Pairetti was crowned champion of [[Turismo Carretera]] driving a prototype Chevrolet nicknamed "The Orange Thunder" ('El trueno naranja' in Spanish), the name adopted due to the color of the unit, equipped with a 250 engine with a transmission similar to the [[Chevrolet Corvette]].

===The end of the Chevrolet 400===
However, in 1969, the "Chevy" (based on the 1968 Chevy II Nova), a sports car that became the most famous in the history of the brand. The idea was to offer a luxury car with sports features on one side (Chevy 400), and sport on the other (Chevy). What was not taken into account is that sales of the Chevy increased at the expense of its predecessor, the 400, causing a competition between both models. While the 400 was produced alongside the Chevy, the 400's North American counterpart ceased production after the 1967 model year.

It was then that to avoid more of a problem, in 1972, "Rally Sport" was launched, which was cheaper than the Chevrolet 400. The same came with three engine options: the "194", the "230" and "250", which came equipped with a carburetor Holey R 2751, and coupled to the 4-speed box. These versions came with different shades of color characteristic of this series: White, Red with black side stripes, light blue with white side stripes or orange with the best known black sidebands. It also highlighted the logo "RS" in the rear of the car and a new grille with 2 headlights instead of 4.

In 1974, Chevrolet Argentina ended production of the "400" with 93,000 units manufactured until then. It was replaced by the Argentine "Chevy Malibu" (based on the 1968–72 American Chevrolet Nova 4-door sedan, with no relation to the North American market [[Chevrolet Malibu]]) based on the Chevelle series. However, the same year, the engine "194" would be used for what would be the first General Motors' [[Mid-size car]] in Argentina, the [[Opel K-180]].

==Engines==
3 different sizes of [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]]s were offered.

==Sports==
The Chevrolet 400 made its debut in the TC in the 1960s, at the same time they began to appear as the first national compact in motorsport. The prototype '''Chevitú''' coupé driven by the famous pilot [[Froilán González]] (derived from the US Chevrolet Chevy II Nova coupé), was the pioneer in this activity receiving praise and denials alike. The '400' was piloted at [[Turismo Carretera|TC]] for several pamphlets, among which stood out Jorge Cupeiro, Carlos Marincovich, [[Jorge Martínez Boero]] and Charles Giay, among others.

===Chevrolet Prototype===
The'' 'Chevrolet Prototype''', were a litter of vehicles submitted by various coaches that their machines with motorized [[Chevrolet]] engines .

The '''Chevrolet Impala (fourth generation)''' are [[full-size]] automobiles produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1965 through 1970 [[model year]]s.  The 1965 Impala was all new, while the 1967 and 1969 models featured new bodies on the same redesigned perimeter frame introduced on the 1965 models. All Impalas of this generation received annual facelifts as well, distinguishing each model year. Throughout the early 1960s, Chevrolet's basic body designs became increasingly subtle, while the bright trim that was part of the Impala package added more than a touch of luxury to the look. The same pattern was followed in the interiors, where the best materials and equipment Chevrolet had to offer were displayed. In short, the Impala was on its way to becoming a kind of junior-grade [[Cadillac]], which, for both the company and its customers, was just fine.&lt;ref&gt;The Chevrolet Chronicle-by the Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1965===
[[File:1965 Chevrolet Impala 4-dr sedan rear right (Mist Blue).jpg|thumb|left|1965 Impala four-door sedan]]
Totally redesigned in 1965, the Impala set an all-time industry annual sales record of more than 1 million units in the [[U.S.]]; which has never been bettered. The new full-size Chevys featured dramatically rounded sides, and an all-new front end with new hood contours, curved, frameless side glass (for pillarless models), and sharper angled windshield with newly reshaped vent windows.   Sport Coupes wore a sleek semi-fastback roofline, and wheel well moldings were revised. Chevrolet promoted the cars' Wide-Stance design, adhesively bonded windshield, and improved full-coil suspension.  A two-tone instrument panel put gauges in a recessed area ahead of the driver. The "X" frame was dropped for a new Girder-Guard full-width [[perimeter frame]] which  reduced the size of the inside driveline tunnel and redesigned suspension. Two-range [[Powerglide]], as well as Synchro-Mesh 3- and 4-speed [[manual transmission]]s were available. The Turbo Hydra-Matic [[automatic transmission]] was offered for the first time. As with previous years, Impalas featured more chrome trim inside and out, with pleated tufted upholstery and door panels plus simulated walnut trim on the lower instrument panel.

Engine choices included the [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine|inline six-cylinder]] as well as the famous Chevy [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|small-block]] and [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|big-block]] V8s.  Automatic transmission buyers were given the option of the newly introduced three-range [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] for the newly introduced Mark IV big-block engine, displacing 396 cubic inches.  The old {{convert|409|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}} "W" engine was discontinued early in the 1965 model year, so early-production '65s got the 409, available only in four-barrel 340 and 400 horsepower options. The new 396 Turbo Jet V8 was the first General Motors engine to receive the Rochester Quadra-Jet four-barrel carburetor that would become a mainstay until the early 1980s. The new 396 was available as a 325-horsepower version with 10.25 to 1 compression ratio and hydraulic lifters or a high-performance version with 11 to 1 compression ratio, solid lifters and 425 horsepower.

For $200, an Impala four-door Sport Sedan could be transformed into an [[Chevrolet Caprice|Impala Caprice]]  establishing a name destined for decades of life. Referenced as Regular Production Option Z18, the Caprice option group included a black-out grille, vinyl top with [[Fleur de lis]] emblems, unique wheel covers, and narrow sill moldings. The new interiors were the most luxurious ever seen in a Chevrolet, and an array of comfort/convenience features. Specially stitched cloth door panels were accented with simulated walnut, and contour-padded seats wore a combination of fabric and vinyl. All of this aimed to give Chevy buyers a "one-of-a-kind" taste of Cadillac's look and ride. Its sales success prompted Chevrolet to make the [[V8 engine|V8]]-only Caprice a full series for 1966.

===1966===
[[File:Chevrolet Impala Sedan.JPG|thumb|left|1966 Impala Sport Sedan]]

The 1966 Impala received only a minor facelift from its predecessor that included a revised horizontal bar grille up front and new triple rectangular taillights that replaced the triple round lights used on full-sized Chevys each year since 1958 with the exception of 1959, and chrome beltline strips were added in response to complaints about parking lot door dings on the clean-lined '65 models. 
The standard column-shift three-speed manual was now full synchronized, and a new 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine replaced the previous 230-cubic-inch six while the 195-horsepower 283-cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 remained the base V-8 engine. Optional engines included a 275-horsepower 327-cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8, the 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V-8 rated at 325 horsepower, or two new 427-cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8s of 390 horsepower with 10.5 to 1 compression ratio and hydraulic lifters or the high performance version rated at 425 horsepower with 11 to 1 compression ratio and solid lifters. A four-speed manual transmission was offered with all V8 engines, while the two-speed Powerglide was the only automatic transmission offered with the six-cylinder engine and 283 and 327-cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8s, and the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic was limited to the 396 and 390-horsepower version of the 427 V-8.
The Impala was the #2-selling convertible in the U.S. in 1966, with 38,000 sold.

===1967===
[[File:Chevrolet Impala 1967 5400ish cc.JPG|thumb|left|1967 Impala 4-Door Sedan]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:67 Impala SS.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chevrolet Impala SS Convertible]] --&gt;

The 1967 Chevrolet full-size was redesigned with enhanced [[Coke bottle styling]]. Dimensions remained roughly the same, still on a 119-inch [[wheelbase]], four inches longer than the mid-size [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]. Impala Sport Coupes had a graceful [[fastback]] roof line, which flowed in an unbroken line into the rear deck. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models. 
Most engine offerings were carryover from 1966 including the base 250 cubic-inch Turbo Thrift 6 (155 horsepower) and 283 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 (195 horsepower), and optional 275-horsepower 327 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V-8 and 325-horsepower 396 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8, with a 385-horsepower 427 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V-8 now the top offering as the high-performance 425-horsepower version of the 427 offered in 1966 was not listed in the 1967 specifications. The two-speed Powerglide automatic was the only shiftless transmission offered with the 250 6 and 283 V-8, but the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic was now available with the 327 V-8 along with the big-block 396 and 427 V-8s.
New options for 1967 included front-[[disc brakes]] (standard with the SS-427 option), stereo 8-track player, fiber optic light monitoring system and vacuum power door locks.
Cloth-and-vinyl upholstery was standard in most closed body styles, but all-vinyl upholstery was a new option at extra-cost in several colors on ''all'' sedan and coupe body styles (heretofore all-vinyl trim was offered as an option on the Sport Coupe and Sport Sedan hardtop body styles in "black" only since 1963), and remained standard equipment on [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and [[station wagon]] models, again in several colors. All Impala models for 1967 also featured upgraded door panels with carpeting on the lower section. A black four-door version of this vehicle, nicknamed "[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)#Impala|Baby]]," is featured prominently in the CW television show ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''. It is owned by [[Dean Winchester]] and has been in their family for over 40 years.

===1968===
[[File:68 Impala.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Impala Sport Coupe]]

The 1968 model's front end received a facelift similar to the 1965 model, while rear bumpers held triple "horseshoe" shaped taillights. The formal Custom Coupe, previously a Caprice exclusive, became available as an Impala. Most Chevrolets got hidden windshield wipers. Plush new interiors also helped attract buyers. Impala overwhelmed the sales charts, as it had for years. Full-sized cars could have a 250-cubic-inch six, a 307-cubic-inch V-8, either of a pair of 327s of 250 or 275 horsepower, or a 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V-8. Topping the list was the big 427, rated at 385 or 425 horsepower. The two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission was still available with the 250 six-cylinder and 307 or 327 V-8s, but the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic could be ordered with all V-8 engines on the Impala Sport Sedan and Custom coupe.
"Astro Ventilation" was an option for the Custom Coupe  that included fresh-air vents, the same units that were used for the optional air conditioning, ''sans'' the center upper vent.  Cars equipped with this option got full-length door glass minus the vent windows.

===1969===
[[File:69 Impala.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Impala Custom Coupe]]

The 1969 Impala and other full-sized Chevrolets were restyled with crisper body lines and front bumpers that wrapped around the grille and ventless front windows were new on all models. The 119-inch (3,023&amp;nbsp;mm) wheelbase, inner body shell and framework were carried over from the 1965 model – along with the roof lines of pillared four-door sedans and station wagons. The station wagon was renamed the Kingswood - reverting to a pre-1962 Chevrolet practice of using different nameplates on wagons than other models. 
Inside, front seat headrests were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate and the ignition switch moved from the dashboard to the steering column and doubled as a lock for the steering wheel when the key was removed, a Federal mandate that took effect with the 1970 models but introduced a year earlier on all General Motors cars. The instrument panel was restyled and highlighted by a new steering wheel.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:69 Impala convt.jpg|thumb|1969 Impala Convertible]] --&gt;

The 1969 Impala also offered a new GM-designed variable-ratio power steering unit as optional equipment along with a seldom-ordered "Liquid Tire Chain" option, which was a vacuum activated button that would spray ice melt on the rear tires&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1969_Chevrolet/1969_Chevrolet_Brochure/1969%20Chevrolet-23.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1969_Chevrolet/1969_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (UPC option code is "V75"). The standard engine was enlarged to a 235&amp;nbsp;hp (175&amp;nbsp;kW) 327 cubic-inch V8 with optional engine choices including a new 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8 rated at 255 and 300&amp;nbsp;hp (220&amp;nbsp;kW), a 265&amp;nbsp;hp (198&amp;nbsp;kW) 396 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8, and 427 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8s rated at 335 and 390&amp;nbsp;hp (291&amp;nbsp;kW). The L72 425 horse power engine was available in all B-Bodies. All V8 engines were now available with the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission for the first time though the two-speed Powerglide was still offered with the 327 and 350 V8s.
During the 1969 model year Impala production, including Kingswood wagons totaled 777,000 units, compared to 166,000 Caprices and Kingswood Estate wagons, 68,700 Biscaynes and Brookwood wagons, and 155,700 Bel Airs and Townsman wagons. Impala totals for 1969 included 768,000 produced with V-8 engines and 8,700 with six-cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;3rd Edition Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1946-75 pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970===
[[File:70 Impala.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Impala Custom Coupe]]

The 1970 Impala got a minor facelift featuring a more conventional bumper under the grill replacing the wrap-around unit used in 1969 and new triple vertical taillights. Fiberglass-belted tires on 15-inch (380&amp;nbsp;mm) wheels were made standard equipment along with a larger standard 250&amp;nbsp;hp (186&amp;nbsp;kW) 350 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8, on most models (the 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine was now only offered on the 1970 Impala four-door sedan as well that year's lower-line Biscayne and Bel Air four-door sedans). Optional V8s included a 300&amp;nbsp;hp (220&amp;nbsp;kW) 350 and a new 265&amp;nbsp;hp (198&amp;nbsp;kW) 400 cubic-inch Turbo Fire V8 (not to be confused with Chevrolet's Turbo Jet big-block 402 V8 (essentially a bored out 396) offered on that year's Chevelles and Monte Carlos). At the top of the engine roster, the big block 427 was replaced by a new, longer stroke, 454 cubic-inch Turbo Jet V8 offered in power ratings of 345&amp;nbsp;hp (257&amp;nbsp;kW) and 390&amp;nbsp;hp (290&amp;nbsp;kW). The 155-horsepower Turbo Thrift six-cylinder, and 250- and 265&amp;nbsp;hp (198&amp;nbsp;kW) Turbo Fire engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the 300&amp;nbsp;hp (220&amp;nbsp;kW) 350 Turbo Fire and both 454 Turbo Jet engines required premium fuel.
A three-speed manual transmission with column shift was standard equipment as in previous years but the floor-mounted four-speed manual with Hurst shifter was dropped from the option list for 1970 as were the Strato bucket seats and center console previously offered on coupes. Automatic transmission options included the two-speed Powerglide on 250 6s and 350 V8s, and three-speed Turbo Hydramatic was available with all engines. Power front disc brakes were standard on the Impala Custom coupe and optional on all other models.
The 1970 Impala was one of three remaining Chevrolet convertibles, with only 9,562 were built. Interest in all size rag tops had dwindled. So was the fascination with large sporty cars, prompting abandonment of the Impala Super Sport. Output of full-sized Chevrolets dropped sharply for the 1970 calendar year, below the million mark, partly as a result of a 65-day strike in the fall of 1970 - but that strike affected the production of early 1971 models. Impala sales, as expected, ranked far above other big Chevrolets with 612,800 Impalas built (6,500 six-cylinder and 606,300 V-8s) compared to 92,000 Caprices, 75,800 Bel Airs and 35,400 Biscaynes, plus another 162,000 station wagons for all series.&lt;ref&gt;3rd Edition Standard Guide to American Cars: 1946-75, pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Right Hand Drive cars were manufactured in Canada for export to some countries such as Australia, [[United Kingdom|UK]], etc., until 1969. They used a version of the 1965 Impala dash panel until 1969. Australian models were assembled in Australia from [[Complete knock down#Automotive|kits]] as this lessened tax on the cars. A similar arrangement applied in New Zealand although the bodies were supplied from Canada already welded, painted and trimmed.

The '''Chevrolet D-20''' (Or 20 Series) is a Series of Pick-up Trucks that was manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] in Brazil and Argentina, As a replacement for the 10 Series . When it was first launched, it could be ordered with a [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine|4.1 liter gasoline or ethanol engine]] (C-20 and A-20 respectfully) or a 3.9 liter Perkins diesel (D-20). In 1991, the Perkins was replaced with the Maxion S4 4.0L diesel (90 ps/88 hp) and the turbocharged Maxion S4T (125 ps/123 hp). In 1995, the S4T was readjusted to match the Euro-II emission limits, producing 150 ps/148 hp. This version was called Turbo Plus, and equipped with mechanical ABS in the rear. Whilst all models are commonly referred to as D-20, the gasoline model was marketed as the C-20, and an otherwise mechanically identical ethanol-fueled version as the A-20.

As well as single-cab and crew-cab versions, Chevrolet sold mechanically identical SUVs, called Bonanza (similar to the [[Chevrolet_Tahoe|Tahoe]]) and Veraneio (similar to the [[Chevrolet_Suburban|Suburban]]).

The '''Chevrolet Series 490''' (or Four-Ninety) is an early American automobile, made from 1915 to 1922 by [[Chevrolet]]. Introduced in June 1915, the 490 sold for $490.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1916_Chevrolet/1916_Chevrolet_490_Brochure/1916%20Chevrolet%20490-02.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1916_Chevrolet/1916_Chevrolet_490_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chevrolet 490 was an immediate success and established the brand as a big player. The name would not denote the price for long (in 1921, the average price was $820&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet_Data_Sheets/1921%20Chevrolet-01.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet_Data_Sheets |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but it would stay low enough to take a chunk out of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] market. The Model T started at $495 at the time. Chevrolet was soon so profitable that Chevrolet owner [[Billy Durant]] began buying shares of [[General Motors|GM]] stock with his Chevrolet stock, enough that he was able to take control of GM and merge Chevrolet with it. Electric horns were standard.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures.com"/&gt; And by 1921, standard equipment included a speedometer, and ammeter, dome lights (closed-body cars only), and headlight dimmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet_Data_Sheets/1921%20Chevrolet-02.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet_Data_Sheets |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
All 490s were only offered with the [[Chevrolet Straight-4 engine|Overhead Valve 171-cubic-inch (2.8 L) four cylinder]], producing {{Convert|24|hp|abbr=on}}. This would be Chevrolet's main engine until the [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine|"Stovebolt" straight six]] replaced it for 1929. 

Chevrolet owner Billy Durant was a firm believer in the [[OHV]] engine, as that had been the reason for the success of his earlier automobile company, [[Buick]], which he had taken over in 1904, and used to found GM in 1908. He lost control of GM in 1910 due to stockholder and banker issues, and Buick still had the patent for the OHV engine, but GM did not dare to sue Durant. Durant would use Chevrolet to regain control of GM in 1917, which he merged with Chevrolet that year.

==The first Chevrolet and GMC trucks==
[[File:GMC Tanker 1919.jpg|thumb|left|1919 GMC tanker]]
The same year Chevrolet merged with GM, Durant wanted a [[Pickup truck|pickup]] to compete with the new [[Ford Model TT]]. The answer was two models, the first 1918 Chevrolet Series 490 Light Delivery chassis cowl rated at half a ton and based on the passenger car. The second, not based on the 490, was a one-ton 1918 Chevrolet Model T (oddly enough) "Ton Truck" shared with [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]. It had a payload capacity rating of 2,000&amp;nbsp;lbs and sold for $1245 retail. Much like the [[chassis cab]] of today, they gave consumers a cheap, flexible platform to build on. Its steering wheel and gear shift lever, along with the instrument panel and gauge cluster, were also lifted from the passenger car. A chassis cowl included the chassis with engine, transmission and the front sheet metal which comprised the hood, front fenders, headlights and grille.&lt;ref&gt;HowStuffWorks&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Superior''' was launched in 1923, manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] for four years with a different series per year. The 1923 model was known as the Series B, the 1924 model was the Series F, for 1925 it was known as the Series K and the 1926 Superior was known as the Series V. It was replaced in 1927 by the [[Chevrolet Series AA Capitol|Series AA Capitol]].
[[File:1924 Chevrolet Truck.jpg|thumb|left|1924 Chevrolet Truck]]
All Superior models were powered by a {{convert|171|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 4-cylinder engine, 26&amp;nbsp;hp @ 2000 rpm, and shared the {{convert|103|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase. The cheapest complete model, which was the '''Superior Roadster''', cost $510 in 1926, while the range-topping model, the '''Superior Sedan''', sold for $825. It was also possible to buy a chassis; the '''Commercial''' chassis cost $425, while the '''Express Truck''' chassis cost $525.

==GM Platform sharing==
This chassis was shared with other GM products at the time, including [[Cadillac]], [[Buick]], [[Oldsmobile]], [[Oakland Motor Car Company|Oakland]] and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] products, introducing the "A-body", "B-body" and "C-body". This policy of sharing mechanicals across multiple brand led to the [[General Motors Companion Make Program]] in the 1920s. Starting with leadership under [[Alfred_P._Sloan|Mr. Sloan]], GM instituted [[Model year|visual styling changes]] for each yearly series.

* [[Chevrolet Advance Design]] 1947-March 1955
* [[Chevrolet Task Force]] April 1955-59: There were actually two Chevy pickups in 1955. The First Series was a carryover, the new models were the Second Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2006/09/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html 1955-'57 Chevrolet 1/2-ton Pickup.

The '''Chevrolet Celebrity''' is an automobile that was produced by the [[Chevrolet]] division of General Motors.  Sold from the 1982 to 1990 model years, a single generation of the Celebrity was produced, replacing the [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]] as the mid-size Chevrolet model range.  During the early 1960s, the nameplate was first used by Oldsmobile for the pillared sedan version of the [[Oldsmobile 88]].&lt;ref&gt;Witzenburg, Gary. "The Name Game", ''[[Motor Trend]]'', April 1984, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is based on the front-wheel drive [[GM A platform (1982)|GM A platform]], and was produced alongside the [[Buick Century]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]], and [[Pontiac 6000]]. The interior space and running gear are the same as the compact Citation, but Celebrity is trimmed and equipped better. Power steering/brakes and automatic transmission were standard in 1982-83 and became optional in 1984. The station wagon debuted for 1984 and so did a Eurosport handling/ appearance package. A high-output fuel-injected V6 became an option in 1985, and diesel engines were phased out. Generation II engines, reworked for 1987, have fuel injection, and a new Getrag-designed 5-speed manual transmission became available with the V6. Balance shafts were added to the Tech IV engine for '88. The 4-cylinder engine gained 12 horsepower in late 1989. Two-doors sold poorly and were dropped the same year

The Celebrity was more spacious than its predecessor, the [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]], but got worse gas mileage. Build quality was also better, and few recalls were issued. However, it did not come without its fair share of problems; the 1982 models had problems with the computerized engine controls and engine vibration.

For the 1990 model year, the Celebrity sedan was discontinued, replaced by the [[Chevrolet Lumina]], with the [[Chevrolet Lumina APV]] minivan replacing the station wagon, which ended production after the 1990 model year.

==Model overview==
[[File:Chevrolet Celebrity wagon -- 03-03-2010.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Celebrity wagon rear]]
Introduced in January 1982&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-celebrity2.htm|title=Chevrolet Celebrity|date=August 7, 2007|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=April 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Chevrolet Celebrity was offered in two-door and four-door notchback sedan body styles.  Chevrolet was the first GM division to transition its mid-size sedans to front-wheel drive, producing the Celebrity alongside its Malibu predecessor for two model years. 

=== Chassis ===
The Celebrity is based on the [[GM A platform (1982)|GM A-body platform]]. Introduced for 1982 as the replacement for the rear-wheel drive G-body platform, the A platform marked the expansion of front-wheel drive from the compact segment into mid-size vehicles. To lower development and production costs, the A platform shares design commonality with the compact-car [[GM X platform (1980)|X platform]]; the Celebrity shares its 104.9 inch (2,665 mm) wheelbase with the [[Chevrolet Citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-celebrity1.htm|title=Chevrolet Celebrity|date=August 7, 2007|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=April 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While derived from the X-body chassis, the A-body platform would not share entirely in its controversial recall issues.  There were driveability problems with the computerized engine control system in 1982 models, and deterioration of the upper engine mount (also called a dogbone) caused engine/transaxle vibration.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Celebritys were available with 2 different bolt patterns on the wheel hub, either 100mm (JA1 code) or 115mm (JA2 code).  Additionally, the transaxles and brakes were different on these two patterns. The smaller of the bolt pattern was used in the standard models, and used a non-vented disc brake while the larger bolt pattern was to house the heavy duty vented disc brakes. A misconception is that all Eurosport models came with the larger bolt pattern, but this was not the case. Most Celebritys equipped with heavy-duty braking systems were base model vehicles intended for fleet and taxi use.

=== Body ===
The Celebrity shares its roofline with the 1982-1988 [[Buick Century#Fifth generation (1982–1996)|Buick Century]] and is distinguished from other A-platform vehicles by its coved rear fascia.  For 1984, Chevrolet introduced a five-door Celebrity station wagon&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-celebrity3.htm|title=Chevrolet Celebrity|date=August 7, 2007|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=April 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; for the first time since 1977, a mid-size station wagon was available with a third-row seat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    

Throughout its production, the Celebrity saw relatively few updates, with minor exterior revisions in 1984, 1986, and 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-celebrity5.htm|title=Chevrolet Celebrity|date=August 7, 2007|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=April 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-celebrity6.htm|title=Chevrolet Celebrity|date=August 7, 2007|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=April 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguished by the addition of composite headlamps in 1987, other revisions included the addition of a CHMSL (acronym for "center high mount stop lamp" and informally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɪ|m|z|əl}}⁠: a central brake lamp mounted higher than the vehicle's left and right stop lamps) in 1986 and the 1990 addition of door-mounted front seatbelts (in place of airbags).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Trim Levels ==
During its nine-year run, the Celebrity was available with various trim/option packages including CS, CL, Estate (which added exterior simulated woodgrain applique on wagons), Eurosport, and Eurosport VR. 

One of the most popular versions of the Chevrolet Celebrity is the Celebrity '''Eurosport'''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Introduced in 1984 as an option package, the Eurosport is both a cosmetic and performance option package for the Chevrolet Celebrity. Distinguished by its black window trim and red emblems, the Eurosport was offered with the 2.8L HO V6 from the Citation X-11 as an option (along with any Celebrity powertrain).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other parts of the Eurosport package include a heavy-duty F41 suspension, black steering wheel and 14" Sport Rallye wheels (which became an option for all Celebrity sedans/wagons). The interior was given model-specific red emblems on the door panels and dashboard.

In Canada, for the 1988 model year, the Olympic Eurosport edition was offered as a tie-in to the Calgary Winter Olympics. Offered only in monochrome white, with all blackout trim exterior painted white to match the body. The only interior colour trim was saddle, with an Olympic logo mounted on the B pillar.

Based on the 1986 Chevrolet Eurosport RS concept car, Chevrolet offered the Celebrity '''Eurosport VR''' limited edition option package for 1987 and 1988.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Converted by Autostyle Cars, near [[Oklahoma City Assembly]], the Eurosport VR was fitted with ground effects, body decals, a blanked-out grille, and aluminum wheels. For 1987, the VR was offered for the four-door sedan and station wagon and are distinguished by their interior, which includes red carpeting, special tri-color door panels, bucket seats with thigh bolsters, and a rear seat cup holder. For 1988, two-door versions were produced as well and were produced with interiors from a standard Celebrity or Celebrity CL. The Eurosport VR was produced in only four colors: red, silver, black, and white.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Discontinuation==
Following the 1987 model year, General Motors ended regular updates to the Celebrity, concentrating on development of the [[Chevrolet Lumina]]. In response to decreasing demand for two-door mid-size sedans, the two-door Celebrity was discontinued after the 1988 model year. The Celebrity sedan was withdrawn following the 1989 model year, with the station wagon dropped during the 1990 model year.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-celebrity8.htm|title=Chevrolet Celebrity|date=August 7, 2007|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=April 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
During the 1980s, within Chevrolet, the Celebrity competed with the Cavalier as the highest-selling car of the brand, overtaking the Cavalier in sales for 1986 and 1987.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For 1986, the Celebrity was the highest-selling car in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inthe1980s.com/best-selling-80s-cars/|title=Best Selling 80s Cars for Each Year of the 1980s {{!}} In the 1980s|date=January 7, 2018|work=In the 1980s|access-date=September 15, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;; as of 2019, it remains the final time a Chevrolet vehicle (or one from any GM brand) has done so.

The '''Chevrolet Aveo (T200)''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|v|eɪ|.|oʊ}} {{respell|ə|VAY|oh}}) is the first generation of the [[Chevrolet Aveo]], a [[subcompact car|subcompact automobile]] from the [[Chevrolet]] division of the American manufacturer [[General Motors]], launched in 2002, developed by the initially independent South Korean manufacturer [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]], later [[GM Korea]]. It was originally marketed as the ''Daewoo Kalos'' and prominently marketed as the ''Aveo''. The model received the ''T200'' internal codes during the car's development. The ''T250'' code was designated for the model's [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]].

Designed, engineered and originally marketed by [[GM Daewoo]], the Aveo superseded the [[Daewoo Lanos]] and was marketed worldwide in 120 countries under seven brands ([[Chevrolet]], Daewoo, [[Holden]], [[Pontiac]], Ravon, [[Suzuki]] and [[ZAZ]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2007-08-01 | url = http://media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_aveo/index.html | title = 2008 Chevrolet Aveo sedan &amp; Aveo5 | publisher = [[General Motors]] | accessdate = 2008-01-25 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080119031933/http://media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_cars/r_c_aveo/index.html |archivedate = 2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its home market of South Korea, the ''T200'' was known as '''Daewoo Kalos''', before being rebranded '''Daewoo Gentra'''. In several Asian, Australasian, and European export markets, the "Daewoo Kalos" name was also used, only to be later renamed "Chevrolet Aveo" or '''Holden Barina''' in the case of Australasia. In Indonesia this generation sold in 3 names, "Chevrolet Aveo" for hatchback, "Chevrolet Kalos" for sedan and sedan for taxi fleet as "Chevrolet Lova". Other names used include '''ZAZ Vida''' in Ukraine, '''Ravon Nexia''' in Russia, '''Chevrolet Nexia''' in Uzbekistan, '''Chevrolet Lova''' in China and '''Pontiac G3''' in the United States, selling alongside the "Chevrolet Aveo" version. In Canada, the name '''Pontiac Wave''' was originally used, followed by '''Pontiac G3 Wave''', before adopting the "Pontiac G3" name used in the United States. Since 2003, [[Suzuki]] has also sold a version in Canada as the '''Suzuki Swift+''' alongside the Chevrolet and Pontiac badged versions. T200's successor, the [[Chevrolet Aveo#Second generation (2011–)|T300]] was released in 2011. The Swift+ was dropped after the 2011 model year due to poor sales along with the entire Suzuki brand, although Suzuki Canada lists 2010 as the final model year Swift+.   In addition, the release of the Pontiac Wave5 is also very relevant to determine the difference of production years and production model names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2008/01/24/2009-pontiac-wave5-unveiled-in-montreal/|title=Pontiac Wave5|last=Nunez|first=Alex|date=2008-01-24|website=autoblog - verizon media|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== T200 ==
The Daewoo Kalos was introduced in 2002, based on a then-new [[Daewoo]] platform named ''T200'', replacing the [[Daewoo Lanos]] (''T100''). Under development before Daewoo's bankruptcy, the Kalos was the company's first new model introduction following its subsequent takeover by General Motors.&lt;ref name="www.channel4.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/4car/road-tests/D/daewoo/kalos02-/kalos02--intro.html?noforward=true|title=Road Test: Daewoo Kalos (2002–2005) |accessdate=|work=channel4.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050505041326/http://www.channel4.com/4car/road-tests/D/daewoo/kalos02-/kalos02--intro.html |archivedate = 2005-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacture of the Kalos began in early March 2002,&lt;ref name="www.fastlane.com.au"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fastlane.com.au/News_Daewoo/Kalos_preprod.htm| title = Kalos looks the goods in pre-production| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008051100/http://www.fastlane.com.au/News_Daewoo/Kalos_preprod.htm| archivedate = 2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pre-production prototypes shown at the Geneva Auto Show in April 2002. The nameplate ''Kalos'' derives from the Greek word [[Kalos inscription|καλός (''kalós'')]] for "beautiful" and "good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 2002 | url = http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/firstdrives/27945/daewoo_kalos.html | title = Daewoo Kalos | publisher = Dennis Publishing | accessdate = 2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newbury|first=Stephen|title=The Car Design Yearbook 2|publisher=Merrell|isbn=1-85894-196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italdesign.it/project/daewoo-kalos-chevrolet-aveo-eng Kalos (Chevrolet Aveo)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20131121220725/http://www.italdesign.it/project/daewoo-kalos-chevrolet-aveo-eng |date=2013-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kalos derives directly from the Kalos Dream concept vehicle first presented at the 2000 [[Paris Motor Show]] and subsequent developmental concepts at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show, 2002 Geneva Auto Show, and 2003 at the Geneva Show. During this three-year development period Daewoo was struggling financially, with the ultimate fate of the company and the concept vehicle remaining uncertain.

Two different T200 front-end styling designs were sold. When released in 2002, the T200 headlamps were detached from the horizontal amber turn signal strip, located directly below. This detached style, used primarily in South Korea and North America, was used in conjunction with a semi-elliptical [[grille]]. When sales in Europe began in 2003, the headlights were an integrated unit that slanted upwards from the "V-shaped" grille towards the [[fender (vehicle)|front fenders]]. In Australia, when the Daewoo Kalos was introduced in 2003, the hatchback featured the integrated lighting arrangement, with the detached style used to differentiate the sedans. In South Korea, where the detached lights were used at first, the integrated design was later utilized as a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]].

The T200 sedan and five-door hatchback featured a [[swage#Car styling swage line|swage line]] running along the lower body to the rear door, which kinks downward prominently on the five-door. Five-doors also feature a side window in the [[C pillar|C/D pillar]] with a distinctively angled lower edge. Interiors feature a circular motif throughout. Upon introduction the initial European models carried an emblem reading "Design Giugiaro." Referring to his firm's design of the Kalos, [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] said: "When we designed it, we set out to produce an alternative to conventional lines and tread new paths in terms of design."&lt;ref name="www.carpages.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carpages.co.uk/chevrolet/daewoo_the_new_kalos_17_09_02.asp|title=The New Daewoo Kalos: Striking Design And Space Efficient|accessdate=2011-01-01|work=carpages.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kalos was sold in three available body styles: a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback from the beginning of production in 2002, and a 3-door hatchback available in certain European markets beginning in 2005. All body styles meet North American [[subcompact]] and European [[supermini|supermini or B-segment]] size classifications. The interior volume was {{convert|102.7|cuft|L|abbr=on}} (5-door) and {{convert|107.4|cuft|L|abbr=on}} (sedan) according to the EPA, meeting the minimum criterion for a [[compact car|compact]] vehicle despite being marketed as a sub-compact. Headroom was unmatched in its class at the time of its introduction.&lt;ref name="www.carpages.co.uk"/&gt; Per the German [[Verband der Automobilindustrie]] (VDA) standard, 5-door hatchbacks featured {{convert|175|L|cuft}} of cargo space with the rear seats in their upright positions and {{convert|735|L|cuft}} with the rear seats folded down, with a maximum payload rating of {{convert|495|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="media.gm.com"/&gt; Per [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) ratings, the 5-door hatchbacks featured cargo volume of {{convert|11.7|cuft|L}} (rear seats up) to {{convert|42|cuft|L|abbr=on}} (rear seats down), with {{convert|7.1|cuft|L|abbr=on}} available in the sedan.

=== Design development ===
Daewoo's now disbanded Worthing Technical Centre in the UK conducted the initial research and platform engineering, with Daewoo's main Technical Center in [[Bupyeong-gu|Bupyong]], Incheon, South Korea completing the majority of the later development programme. Daewoo engineers refined the chassis in Britain, on the proving ground at [[Motor Industry Research Association]] near Nuneaton, UK.&lt;ref name="www.carpages.co.uk"/&gt; Long-term testing covered nearly 2.2 million kilometers (1.4&amp;nbsp;million miles) with further testing outside South Korea on test sites in [[Arjeplog]], Sweden; [[Granada]] and [[El Vendrell]], Spain; [[Kapuskasing]], Canada and Beijing, China.&lt;ref name="media.gm.com-2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/kr/daewoo/en/news/2002/090002_kalos_long.html|title=Market and model – Good Prospects for the Kalos in a Growing Segment|accessdate=|work=media.gm.com |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080319120715/http://media.gm.com/kr/daewoo/en/news/2002/090002_kalos_long.html |archivedate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an April, 2003 GMDAT press release, Daewoo built 119 prototypes during the Kalos's design and development, crashing 31 for research and data-gathering purposes,&lt;ref name="media.gm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmdaewoo.co.kr/eng01/news/news02_view.jsp?idxno=20&amp;search=&amp;type=1&amp;nowpage=19|title=Kalos mini-car marks fresh start for GM-Daewoo}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and manufacturing 39 pilot production vehicles to verify standards and quality.&lt;ref name="media.gm.com"/&gt;

The body's sheet metal panel gaps were kept to {{convert|3|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and all but the roof panel were galvanized steel. 46% of the Kalos' underlying structural components were produced with high-strength steel, with tailor-welded blanks used in the production of the vehicle to put strength where needed while saving weight. The front suspension used MacPherson struts with offset coil springs and a stabilizer bar, while the rear featured a semi-independent torsion beam axle.

The body featured a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.35, with a frontal area of {{convert|2.16|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} giving aerodynamic resistance of {{convert|0.74|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="www.carpages.co.uk-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carpages.co.uk/chevrolet/daewoo_kalos_market_and_model_part_1_17_09_02.asp|title=The New Daewoo Kalos&amp;nbsp;— Market And Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Kalos iterations featured high [[H-point]] seating within a relatively narrow, short and high-roofed body that combined a long wheelbase with short front ({{convert|81|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and rear ({{convert|49|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}, hatchback) overhangs to maximize the outward visibility, interior space and maneuverability for the vehicle's footprint. Rear seat [[H-point]]s are higher in all body types, giving the car theatre seating.

=== Design features ===
* The interior features Isofix child seat anchorages.
* The T200 features a slot specifically for holding toll tickets in the instrument panel adjacent to the steering wheel.
* The optional four-speed automatic has a “hold” feature that causes the four speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] to behave like a three speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]: that is, it 'holds' the transmission in the gear which is selected.  Useful for engine braking down long grades.
* Kalos models and their variants are marketed as entry-level vehicles in various trim levels globally with options unusual at entry-level: including AM/FM/CD/MP3 audio, steering wheel mounted radio controls, power locks and windows, remote keyless entry, and heated sideview mirrors and power sunroof.
* Common equipment includes tilt steering column, six-way adjustable driver seat, rear-window defroster, remote fuel door and a 60/40 split-bench folding rear seat. The instrument panel includes a tachometer, speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, coolant temperature gauge and lighting dimmer control. The IP also has a center storage tray, lighter, extra 12-volt outlet, digital quartz clock and lighted glove box.

=== Safety ===
The Aveo has generally not been rated highly by consumer agencies and automotive reviewers. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reported in 2011 that "The Aveo does poorly in IIHS crash tests and receives the second lowest score of Marginal in roof strength, side impact and rear crash tests. It receives a higher score of Acceptable in front offset tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Chevrolet_Aveo/Safety/ |title=2011 Chevrolet Aveo Safety |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively high profile of the hatchback model, in particular, makes it susceptible to crosswinds and degrades handling somewhat.

The Kalos models have been tested in at least four international New Car Assessment Programs, the results reflecting varying equipment [http://www.safecarguide.com/exp/euroncap/euroncap.htm  and the differences in the tests themselves.] Based on market priorities and price point control, some safety equipment is either unavailable or available only as extra-cost options (including side airbags, ABS, foglights and a rear center position three-point seatbelts and headrests.)

'''South Korea:''' models received four stars for both driver and front-seat passenger in crash tests conducted by the Korean Automobile Test and Research Institute ([[KATRI]]).&lt;ref name="media.gm.com-5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmdaewoo.co.kr/eng01/news/news02_view.jsp?idxno=20929&amp;search=&amp;type=1&amp;nowpage=13|title=Daewoo Kalos Conquers U.S. Car Market in First Ten Months|access-date=2008-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415222117/http://www.gmdaewoo.co.kr/eng01/news/news02_view.jsp?idxno=20929&amp;search=&amp;type=1&amp;nowpage=13|archive-date=2008-04-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europe:''' models received [http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chevrolet_kalos_2006/256.aspx the following] European New Car Assessment Program ([[Euro NCAP]]) ratings:
* Adult Occupant: {{Rating|3|5}}, score 17
* Child Occupant: {{Rating|3|5}}, score 26
* Pedestrian: {{Rating|2|4}}, score 11

'''Australia:''' Holden Barina models received scored 2 stars (of 5) from [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program]] (ANCAP), a rating that is lower than the previous European-built, Opel-based Barina had scored,&lt;ref name="media.gm.com-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/5/holden-barina-korean-safety/|title=Holden Barina Korean Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lowest ANCAP rating since 2004.&lt;ref name="media.gm.com-4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltsa.govt.nz/vehicles/ancap/holden/barina-2005.html|title=Holden Barina ANCAP ratings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the Australian Barina models do not feature the front-seat mounted side airbags offered in other markets (e.g., USA), nor are the ANCAP ratings directly comparable to the ratings of other NCAP programs.

A revised sedan was introduced in April 2005 at the [[Auto Shanghai|Shanghai Motor Show]], designed in cooperation with the [[Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center]] (PATAC).&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.media.gm.com/archive/documents/domain_520/docId_14091_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bearing the internal code ''T250'' and sold in South Korea as the "Daewoo Gentra", the revision comprised primarily interior and exterior styling changes, a new interior [[dashboard|instrument panel]] and minor equipment changes, including increased sound deadening.&lt;ref name="www.topspeed.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/chevrolet/2007-chevrolet-aveo-ar12542.html|title=2007 Chevrolet Aveo|accessdate=2011-01-01|work=topspeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of the radio antenna into the rear glass and extensive wind tunnel testing helped reduce the coefficient of drag from 0.348 to 0.326.&lt;ref name="www.topspeed.com"/&gt; It was subsequently launched in Europe in September 2005 at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.media.gm.com/archive/documents/domain_520/docId_18536_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A restyled hatchback with the sedan's updated [[dashboard|instrument panel]] was presented as the Chevrolet Aveo during the 2007 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]],&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.media.gm.com/archive/documents/domain_520/docId_38451_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt; to be marketed in Europe and North America. The Korean market's restyle of the hatchback, the Gentra X, featured a less distinct/more "normal" grille treatment that formed the basis for the [[Holden]], [[Pontiac]] and [[Suzuki]]-branded variants.

Later iterations, including the Kalos, Aveo, Barina and Gentra sedans, the Gentra X hatchback and the 2007 "Frankfurt Show" hatchbacks were styled in-house and with the assistance of [[PATAC]], and depart notably from the original Giugiaro exterior and interior styling designs.

With launch of the Gentra X in South Korea, GMDAT had replaced engines of T250. 1.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Daewoo S-TEC engine|S-TEC II]] [[inline-four engine]] was updated with features such as dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) and timing chain (older version has timing belt) system. 1.6&amp;nbsp;L E-TEC II engine had replaced with ECOTEC (GEN-III) engine with new features such as variable valve timing mechanism.

US Aveo safety features include available four-channel, four-sensor ABS system with electronic brake force distribution (EBD), and front (dual-stage) and side air bags for front row occupants with a passenger-sensing system. Beginning with 2008, Aveo standard equipment includes a tire pressure monitoring system.

The T250 model has been tested by the [[Euro NCAP|European New Car Assessment Program]] (Euro NCAP):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chevrolet_aveo_2006/250.aspx |title=EuroNCAP crash test results for the 2006 Chevrolet Aveo |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adult Occupant: [[File:Crashtest-Stern 2-1.svg]] – 21 calculated as 3 for front plus 15 for side, with a struck out star: "The driver's chest made contact with the steering-wheel, distorting the rim. Compression of the driver's chest indicated an unacceptably high risk of life-threatening injury. As a result, the final star of the adult occupant rating is struck through."
* Child Occupant: {{Rating|4|5}}, score 39
* Pedestrian: {{Rating|3|4}}, score 19
These ratings apply only to 4-door sedan Aveo.The 5-door/3-door hatchback model has not been tested by EuroNCAP but since it has the same floor as T200 model it earns 3 stars without side airbags and 4 stars with side airbags. The Australian version of the T250 three-door, the Holden Barina, was crashtested by ANCAP and gained a four-star rating.

== Marketing and production ==
Besides production in [[Bupyeong-gu|Bupyong]], South Korea (between 2002 and 2011), the Kalos and Aveo models have also been assembled in [[#Europe|Poland]] (2007–2011), [[#Europe|Ukraine]] (2004–present), [[#Europe|Russia]] (2005–2012), Kazakhstan, [[#South America|Ecuador]], [[#South America|Colombia]], [[#South America|Venezuela]], [[#South America|China]], [[#India|India]], [[#Thailand|Thailand]], Egypt and [[#Mexico|Mexico]].&lt;ref name="www.automotiveworld.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.automotiveworld.com/news/manufacturing/70156-mexico-gm-builds-first-chevrolet-aveo-at-new-san-luis-potosi-plant|title=Mexico: GM builds first Chevrolet Aveo at new San Luis Potosi plant|accessdate=2011-01-01|publisher=|year=2008|author=Glenn Brooks|work=automotiveworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T200 was sold as Daewoo Kalos; the hatchback named 'Kalos V' and the sedan simply Kalos. The tagline from the very first advertisements was 'It's beautiful – Hi! Kalos'. Daewoo began selling the T250 sedan in September 2005 as the Daewoo Gentra, replacing the Kalos sedan. "Gentra" is derived from the English word "gentleman" and "transportation". The tagline in the advertising campaign introducing the Gentra in Korea was "Are you gentle?", and the campaign starred [[Daniel Henney]]. In October 2007, the Kalos hatchback adopted the T250 underpinnings and was renamed Gentra X. The Kalos won, twice consecutively (2003 and 2004), the Korea Design Power Index (KDPI) conducted by the Korean Management Association (KMA) and deriving from interviews and an internet polling of 20,000 consumers in Korea's six largest cities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

[[File:Chevrolet Lova facelift China 2012-04-15.jpg|thumb|left|2009 Chevrolet Lova facelift (China)]]
The T250 sedan is sold as the "Chevrolet Lova" in China. It was facelifted in March 2009, receiving the front end of the T250 hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://es.autoblog.com/2009/05/08/china-chevrolet-presenta-el-new-lova/ |title=China: Chevrolet presenta el New Lova |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=16 December 2013 |publisher=Autoblog Español |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216184509/http://es.autoblog.com/2009/05/08/china-chevrolet-presenta-el-new-lova/ |archivedate=16 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, [[Shanghai GM]] launched the similar-sized [[Chevrolet Sail]] sedan.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/chevrolet/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/cn/en/2010/January/11.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in China and is based on the second generation of GM's [[GM Gamma platform|Gamma platform]], which has been designed by [[GM Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auto-china.cn/news_view.asp?id=69504 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216184657/http://www.auto-china.cn/news_view.asp?id=69504 |archivedate=2013-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a hatchback version, introduced the same year, in the month of June.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.gm.com/content/media/cn/en/chevrolet/vehicles/SailNB/2010.detail.html/content/Pages/news/cn/en/2010/June/0601.html{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====
The T250 was launched in India in 2006 as Chevrolet Aveo along with the slogan "An Indian Revolution", referencing Chevrolet's [[An American Revolution]] ad campaign. The T200 hatchback has been sold in India since December 2006 as the Chevrolet Aveo U-VA. The Aveo was promoted in the Bollywood film [[Ta Ra Rum Pum]] with decals on the race cars, but the cars were ARCA-spec [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]s.The television commercial of the Chevrolet Aveo UV-A features Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

==== Thailand ====
The T250 Sedan is sold as the Chevrolet Aveo in Thailand. In February 2008, the Aveo was awarded the ‘Green Label’ environmental certificate by the Thailand Environmental Institute, being recognized for its 'minimal impact on the environment in comparison to other passenger cars in Thailand'.&lt;ref name="http://media.gm.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/th/en/news/news_detail.brand_gm.html/content/Pages/news/th/en/Companyinfo/Achievements_Recognition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405073409/http://media.gm.com/content/media/th/en/news/news_detail.brand_GM.html/content/Pages/news/th/en/Companyinfo/Achievements_Recognition|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-04-05|title=Achievements &amp; Recognition|accessdate=2011-01-01|work=media.gm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.tei.or.th"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tei.or.th/greenlabel/|title=Official Website of Thailand Environmental Institute|accessdate=2011-01-01|work=tei.or.th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Chevrolet the first automobile brand in Thailand to have won this award twice in a row.
As of 2010, the Chevrolet Aveo is sold with either a 1,399&amp;nbsp;cc or 1,598&amp;nbsp;cc 16V [[DOHC]] [[E-TEC II]] engine with VGIS [[variable length intake manifold]]. The 1.4 grades are MT [[Manual transmission]] or AT [[Automatic transmission]] 'Base', MT/AT 'LS' and AT 'LSX'. The 1.6 grades are AT only 'LT', 'LSX', 'LUX' and 'SS'.&lt;ref name="en.chevrolet.co.th"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.chevrolet.co.th/vehicles/view-all-vehicles/cars/aveo/models/aveo-1-6.html|title=2010 Aveo Model Line-up|accessdate=2011-01-01|work=en.chevrolet.co.th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All models except the 1.6 LT are configured to use [[E20 fuel]].

==== Vietnam ====
As of 2011, [[VIDAMCO]] of Vietnam produces the T250 sedan in [[knock-down kit|complete knock-down]] (CKD) form at its [[Hanoi]] production facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellison |first=Edd |date=2010-11-15 |url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/vietnam_auto_industry_101115/ |title=Vietnam Gearing Up for Rapid Auto Industry Growth |work=[[Ward's|Ward's Auto]] |publisher=[[Penton Media]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926235722/http://wardsauto.com/ar/vietnam_auto_industry_101115/ |archivedate=2011-09-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The VIDAMCO model was launched in Vietnam on January 20, 2006 under the name "Daewoo Gentra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vidamco.com.vn/history.php |title=History |publisher=GM Daewoo VIDAMCO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814063605/http://www.vidamco.com.vn/history.php |archivedate=2011-08-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The T200 model was available as the "Daewoo Kalos" before Daewoo's Australian operations ceased at the end of 2004 and was absent from the Australian market until re-introduced in December 2005 as the TK [[Holden Barina]] (3-door and 5-door). The TK Barina replaced the previous [[Holden Barina|XC Barina]], which was an imported and rebadged European [[Opel Corsa]]. The T250 sedan was introduced in February 2006, and both the T200 and T250 models are sold together as the Barina lineup. The switch from the Opel-sourced Corsa was criticized, given the Kalos' lower [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] safety performance. The T250 hatchback, both 3-door and 5-door, was introduced in August 2008.

=== Europe ===
Until the end of 2004, the T200 was sold as "Daewoo Kalos" in Western Europe. In early 2005, the Chevrolet brand replaced the Daewoo brand and the Kalos was [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] the "Chevrolet Kalos", coinciding with the introduction of the three-door. The new T250 sedan is marketed as the "Chevrolet Aveo" replacing the Kalos sedan in 2006. A revised hatchback was introduced in the 2007 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], to go on sale in early 2008 as the Aveo—replacing the Kalos. In Italy there exists a variant of the Aveo called the ''Chevrolet Aveo Eco Logic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecomotori.net/ecocarburanti/30-gpl/714-chevrolet-aveo-eco-logic-gpl.html |title=The Aveo Eco Logic in Italy |publisher=Ecomotori.net |accessdate=2010-10-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723111931/http://www.ecomotori.net/ecocarburanti/30-gpl/714-chevrolet-aveo-eco-logic-gpl.html |archivedate=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This low emission version has a dual power [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] engine 1.2 and 1.4 16V.

The T200 was sold in Eastern Europe as "Chevrolet Aveo" from its introduction in 2003. The T250 has replaced the T200 sedan in 2006, retaining the same name. Versions sold in this region had 1.4&amp;nbsp;L engines, and were available as both five-door hatchback and four-door sedan. In 2006 it was announced that [[Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych|FSO]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland, would begin assembling the Aveo under a [[joint venture]] between GM and FSO's owner, the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] company [[Ukrainian Automobile Corporation|UkrAVTO]]. Production of the sedan started in November 2007, while the hatchback was assembled from July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Все новости по теме – европейский союзНа заводе FSO сошел с конвейера первый Chevrolet Aveo|url=http://www.autoconsulting.com.ua/article.php?sid=8372|publisher=Autoconsulting.com.ua|language=Russian|date=2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting from April 2008, they were delivered in the rest of the European markets too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |journal=Auto Moto Hors-Série N°60: Les 3000 voitures du monde – Édition 2009 |page=57 |quote=Celle qui ést diffusée en Europe ne vient plus de Corée du Sud, mais de Pologne.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production in Poland ended in February 2011, when UkrAVTO decided moving it to Ukraine, where it would be assembled only for the local market and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoconsulting.com.ua/article.php?sid=19122 |title=This year ZAZ starts assembling the Chevrolet Aveo |publisher=Autoconsulting.com.ua |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes also as an effect of the [[free trade agreement]] reached between South Korea and the [[European Union]], that took effect from 1 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSO zamieni amerykańskie chevrolety na chińskie chery?|url=http://wyborcza.biz/biznes/1,101562,8377234,FSO_zamieni_amerykanskie_chevrolety_na_chinskie_chery_.html|publisher=Wyborcza.biz|accessdate=2011-10-29|language=Polish|date=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, UkrAVTO began to manufacture the car on full-scale under the [[ZAZ]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZAZ widens model lineup.

The T200 models were introduced to the US and Canada 2004 models at the 2003 (February) [[Chicago Auto Show]] as the Chevrolet Aveo to replace the [[Daewoo Lanos]] when [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo]] withdrew from many markets outside South Korea in 2002. The US 5-door and 4-door models went on sale in November 2003,&lt;ref name="USAtoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2006-01-08-detroit-usat_x.htm|title=Move over gas guzzlers, small cars are coming | work=USA Today | first1=James R. | last1=Healey | date=2006-01-13 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as reported by the [[Boston Globe]] in November 2006, "the Aveo (was) the largest-selling subcompact in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.boston.com/cars/news/articles/2006/11/19/market_for_subcompact_cars_grows_as_styling_features_safety_improve/| title= Market for subcompact cars grows as styling, features, safety improve| work= The Boston Globe | date=2006-11-19 | first1=Tom | last1=Krisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aveo was introduced for its market debut in a 60-second television advertisement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UTMDcS-on8 |title=Michael Bay Commercial Chevy Car Carrier |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that first appeared on New Year's Eve 2003, created by the firm of [[Campbell-Ewald]], directed by [[Michael Bay]] &lt;ref name="www.adweek.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2061066|title=Critique: An American Evolution|accessdate=2011-01-01|year=2004|author=Barbara Lippert|work=adweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featuring the song [[Magic Carpet Ride (Steppenwolf song)|Magic Carpet Ride]] by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]. The advertisement was titled [[An American Revolution|"An American Revolution, Car Carrier"]] and featured six yet to be introduced cars and trucks boarding a car carrier as it traversed the United States. It featured the Aveo descending the Twin Peaks of San Francisco and making an airborne leap highly reminiscent of Steve McQueen's [[Ford Mustang]] in the movie [[Bullitt]], before boarding the car carrier. Two other fifteen second TV ads also created by the firm of Campbell-Ewald,&lt;ref name="adweek.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=2081264|title=Campbell-Ewald Puts Chevy Back in the Game|accessdate=2011-01-01|year=2004|author=Kevin Ransom|work=adweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  spotlighted the  Aveo: "Pachyderm" showing an elephant, chased down a city street by an Aveo and "Big Little," in which four basketball players who enter the car appear tiny in big seats, highlighting the vehicle's interior volume.

In February 2004 GM issued a "stop delivery" order, to investigate five accidents that occurred in a tight time frame just as the Aveo was introduced to the US market. The order was lifted shortly thereafter, after an investigation revealed no connection among the accidents.&lt;ref name="www.theautochannel.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2004/02/19/181273.html|title=GM Investigates New Aveo Crashes|accessdate=2011-01-01|work=theautochannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T250 sedan debuted in January 2006 as the 2007 Chevrolet Aveo at the [[Greater Los Angeles Auto Show]]. Sales commenced in North America in August 2006. Also, 2009 is the first model year of the Aveo for Mexican sales, replacing the [[Opel]]-based [[Chevrolet Corsa]].

The Aveo 5-door hatchback was marketed as the "Aveo5" in Canada since its inception and in the US beginning with model year 2007. The models were sold as Pontiac Wave (4-door and 5-door, since the 2005 model year) and Suzuki Swift+ (5-door) in Canada. The T200 Wave sedan was replaced for the 2007 model year with the T250, coinciding with the release of the 2007 T250 Aveo. For the 2009 model year, Pontiac Wave was renamed to Pontiac G3 Wave in Canada. In the United States, Pontiac sold the 5-door hatchback as the Pontiac G3 starting in the spring of 2009. Because of General Motors phasing out the Pontiac brand, the Pontiac G3/Wave is no longer manufactured after the 2010 model year, and the last Pontiac G3 Wave rolled off the line in December 2009, making this the last overall Pontiac vehicle to roll off the line, even though the last [[Pontiac]] for the American market was the 2010 [[Pontiac G6]]. The Pontiac G3 has the distinction of being the last Pontiac-badged model introduced to the United States market before the brand's 2010 demise. For the 2010 model year, Canadian models are simply referred to as Pontiac G3.

{{Anchor|Mexico}}In Mexico, the T250 sedan went on sale as a 2009 model, replacing the [[Opel]]-based [[Chevrolet Corsa]] and GM Daewoo-built Pontiac G3, after the GM announcement of discontinuing the Pontiac brand following the 2009 model year in Mexico and the 2010 model year elsewhere. It is produced in [[San Luis Potosi]], Mexico. From the May 2010 model year, the GM badges next to the doors were removed. From the 2012 model year, the Aveo underwent a facelift, receiving a similar front-end with the one of the hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevrolet Aveo 2012 a la venta en México|url=http://mx.noticias.autocosmos.yahoo.net/2011/06/07/chevrolet-aveo-2012-a-la-venta-en-mexico|publisher=Autocosmos.com|accessdate=2012-02-06|date=2011-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219135832/http://mx.noticias.autocosmos.yahoo.net/2011/06/07/chevrolet-aveo-2012-a-la-venta-en-mexico|archive-date=2012-02-19|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer sold in the United States and Canada.

{{anchor|Suzuki Swift+}}
For the Canadian market the Swift+ was created with a joint between GM Daewoo and Suzuki, after Suzuki stopped selling the previous model [[Suzuki Cultus|Swift]] in 2001. The Swift+, a version of the Daewoo Kalos, was introduced in fall 2003 and marketed solely as a 5-door hatchback. For the 2009 model year, the Suzuki Swift+ was updated in styling and a new Opel ECOTEC 106&amp;nbsp;hp 1.6 engine receiving 7.9 L/100&amp;nbsp;km for city and 5.7 for highway from the previous 8.9/5.9, shared with the Pontiac G3 Wave and Chevrolet Aveo.

'''2005:''' Sidemarker lights change from orange to clear. Black trim applied to B-pillars of all models and C-pillars of hatchbacks.

'''2006:''' Rear Spoiler changes from "hugger" style to pedestal style spoiler with several inches of clearance from body.

'''2007:''' The four-door Aveo sedan is redesigned, while the five-door hatchback remains unchanged. A new trim level structure for the sedan is introduced that includes base '''1LS''', midlevel '''1LT''', and range-topping '''2LT''' trims. Wheel choices are revised, and include both black steel wheel with plastic wheel covers, or aluminum-alloy wheels, in either fourteen-inch or fifteen-inch diameters. Exterior changes include new lighting with "Altezza-Style" rear tail lamps and available front fog lamps, and new front headlamps. A new chrome front grille is added that takes cues from other vehicles in the [[Chevrolet]] lineup. Interior changes include new audio systems (an A/M-F/M stereo radio for base models, or an A/M-F/M stereo radio with a single-disc CD/MP3 player (upgradeable to a newly-available, six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer) on upgraded models, both with a 3.5-millimeter (3.5mm) auxiliary audio input jack, and either a four-speaker audio system or a six-speaker audio system with separate "A"-pillar mounted tweeters), a redesigned dashboard, and an available Neutral (Beige) interior color combination. Power is still delivered by a 1.6L [[EcoTec]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine producing 103 horsepower and 107 lb. ft. of torque, and mated to either a four-speed automatic transmission, or a five-speed manual transmission, regardless of trim level. 

'''2009:''' The five-door Aveo hatchback is redesigned and renamed the '''Aveo 5'''. A new emblem signifying the name change is applied to the rear hatch. A wider, split front grille and more angular front headlamps, as well as optional front fog lamps, are added. All Aveos are still powered by the 1.6L [[EcoTec]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, though horsepower is up by 3 horsepower to 106 horsepower (up from 103 horsepower), and torque is down to 105 lb. ft. of torque from 107 lb. ft. of torque. Transmission choices remain either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic, regardless of trim level. Trim levels are also restructured to base '''1LS''', midlevel '''1LT''', and range-topping '''2LT'''. Upscale features available on upper trims include the [[OnStar]] in-vehicle telematics system, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a six-speaker premium audio system with "A"-pillar mounted tweeters, a power, tilt-and-sliding sunroof, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with available remote audio system and cruise controls, fifteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and perforated leatherette-trimmed seating surfaces with perforated front and rear door panel inserts, and faux wood interior trim panels on Aveos equipped with the Neutral (Beige) interior. A [[rebadged]] version of the Aveo 5 becomes available in the [[United States]], called the [[Pontiac G3]] (also called the [[Pontiac Wave]] in other markets), although unlike the '''Wave''', the [[United States]] version is not available in four-door sedan form. The G3 is only offered for the 2009 [[model year]], as [[Pontiac]] also enters its last full model year. 

'''2010:''' GM badges disappear on Chevrolet Aveo models, even though early 2010 models did have GM badges. Also, the G3 enters its final model year only in Canada, but drops the "Wave" name, making the Pontiac G3 nameplate exclusive to Canada after the United States &amp; Mexico dropped the Pontiac G3 name.

'''2011'''" The Aveo enters its final [[model year]] in [[North America]] with few changes, as it is replaced by the all-new [[Chevrolet Sonic]] for the 2012 [[model year]], based on the [[Chevrolet Aveo]] that keeps its name in other countries. 


The Aveo has received mixed reviews, while it has earned praise from many for its very low price tag, it has been criticized for poor fuel economy (compared with other vehicles in its class) and poor reliability by reviewers such as Consumer Reports and JD Power and Associates.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The '''Chevrolet Chevy II/Nova''' is a [[compact car|small automobile]] manufactured by [[Chevrolet]], and produced in five generations for the 1962 through 1979, and 1985 through 1988 [[model year]]s. Nova was the top [[car model|model]] in the Chevy II lineup through 1968. The Chevy II nameplate was dropped after 1968, with Nova becoming the nameplate for all of the 1969 through 1979 models. Built on the [[GM X platform (RWD)|X-body platform]], the Nova was replaced by the 1980 [[Chevrolet Citation]] introduced in the spring of 1979. The Nova nameplate returned in 1985, produced through 1988 as a [[GM S platform|S-car]] based, [[NUMMI]] manufactured, [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] based on the [[front wheel drive]], Japan home-based [[Toyota Sprinter]].

== History ==

=== Origin ===
Chevrolet designer Clare MacKichan recalled about creating the Chevy II: "There was no time for experimentation or doodling around with new ideas from either the engineers or from us in design; And it had to be a basic-type car." The 1962 Chevy II rode a 110-inch [[wheelbase]], compared to 109.5 for the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], at which Chevy's new compact was aimed. "I think that was the quickest program we ever did at any time," he continued. "We worked night and day on that car, and it didn't take very long to run it through our shop because we had a deadline." And that is what made the Chevy II one of the fastest new-car development programs in GM history – just 18 months after the designers got the green light, the first production Chevy II rolled off the Willow Run, Michigan, assembly line in August 1961, in time for its September 29 introduction. Unlike the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]], the 1962 Chevy II was deliberately never intended to be revolutionary in concept or execution; its mission was to give Chevrolet buyers a simple, back-to-the-basics compact car. When he announced the Chevy II to the press, Chevrolet General Manager [[Ed Cole]] described the car as offering "maximum functionalism with thrift."

There was a lot of debate within the Chevrolet organization over just what to call this new car, and the decision to go with "Chevy II" was a very late one. Among the finalists was Nova. It lost out because it didn't start with a "C," but was selected as the name for the top-of-the-line series. Ultimately the Nova badge would replace Chevy II, but that wouldn't happen until 1969. In almost every way, the creators of the Chevy II used Falcon as a benchmark. The 1962 model range included sedans and wagons, as well as a two-door [[hardtop]] and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]].  The only body styles it didn't offer which the Falcon did were a sedan delivery and [[coupe utility]] (the [[Ford Ranchero#1960–1965 Falcon Ranchero|Ford Falcon Ranchero]]), most likely to avoid competing with Chevrolet's own [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].

After the [[Rear-engine design|rear-engine]] [[Chevrolet Corvair]] was outsold by the conventional Ford [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Falcon]] in 1960, Chevrolet completed work on a more conventional compact car that would eventually become the Chevy II. The car was of semi-[[unibody]] construction having a bolt on front section joined to its unitized cabin and trunk rear section, available in two-door [[coupe]] and four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] configurations as well as [[convertible (car)|convertible]] and [[station wagon]] versions. The 1962 Chevy II came in three series and five body styles—the 100 Series, 300 Series and Nova 400 Series. A 200 series was also introduced, but was discontinued almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mays|first=James|title=1963 Chevrolet Chevy II|url=http://www.oldcarscanada.com/2011/11/1963-chevrolet-chevy-ii.html|work=www.OldCarsCanada.Com|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sportiest-looking of the lot was the $2,475 Nova 400 convertible—23,741 were produced that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | ref = JG1 | first = John | last = Gunnell | title = Standard Catalogue of American Cars 1946–1975, Revised 4th edition | page = 174 | publisher = Krause Publications Inc. | location = Iola, WI | date = 2002-04-01 | isbn = 978-0873494618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Available engines for the Chevy II in 1962 and 1963 included Chevrolet's [[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|inline-four engine]] of {{convert|153|CID|l|1|abbr=on}} and a new third generation {{convert|194|CID|l|1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine]]. All Chevy II engines featured [[overhead valve]]s. A V8 engine was not available in 1962 and 1963. With no documentation proving it, the legend of a dealer installed V8 engine being in a 1962 or 1963 model year Chevy II is a myth. Refer to the GM Heritage Center 1963 Chevrolet Nova information available on the GM Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM Vehicle Information Kits|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits.html|website=GM Heritage Center|publisher=GM|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, that documentation does not list a V8 engine as a possible dealer installed option.

In 1962 and 1963 the Nova option for the Chevy II was available in a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] body style, and a two-door [[hardtop]] was available from 1962 to 1965, although the hardtop was dropped when the 1964 models were first introduced, but subsequently brought back to the line later in the model year. Like all Chevy two-door hardtops, the body style was marketed as the Sport Coupe.

For 1963, the Chevy II Nova [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]] was released, under [[Regular Production Option|RPO]] Z03.&lt;ref name="Super Chevy, 5/94, p.14"&gt;''Super Chevy'', 5/94, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; It featured special emblems, instrument package, wheel covers, side moldings, bucket seats, and floor shifter, and was available only on the 400 series sport coupe and convertible.&lt;ref name="Super Chevy, 5/94, p.14" /&gt; Cost of the package was US$161.40, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|161.4|1963|r=2}}}} today.&lt;ref&gt;''Super Chevy'', 5/94, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, the Nova option could not officially have V8 [[engine]]s at this time—the standard SS engine was the six-cylinder (this was also applicable to the Impala (and later the early Chevelle c. 1964–65) when the SS was a sport and appearance package)—but [[small-block]] V8 engine swaps were commonplace among enthusiasts.

For 1964, sales were hit hard by the introduction of the new [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]],&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.281.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chevy II received its first factory V8 option, a {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|283|CID|l|1|abbr=on}}, as well as a {{convert|230|CID|l|1|abbr=on}} straight six.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/chevrolet-nova/chevrolet-nova-history.shtml Chevrolet Nova History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222100306/http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/chevrolet-nova/chevrolet-nova-history.shtml |date=February 22, 2010 }}'', (Muscle Car Club). Retrieved 2010-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#Generation 3|six-cylinder]] was actually the third generation engine, replacing the second generation Stovebolt. Rival manufacturer [[Chrysler]] had earlier developed the [[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant Six]] in their [[Plymouth Valiant]], a Chevy II competitor, when the cars were introduced to the public in late 1959 as 1960 models.  At introduction in the fall, the hardtop coupe was missing in the lineup, contributing to a loss of sales (as well as showroom appeal).  Chevrolet subsequently reintroduced the Sport Coupe in the lineup later in the model year, and it remained available through 1967.

[[File:1965 Chevrolet Nova sedan 4dr.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Chevrolet Chevy II Nova 4-door sedan (with aftermarket wheels)]]

The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were updated with cleaner front-end styling courtesy of a fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, oil pressure, and temperature gauges.
An expanded engine lineup gave customers six power choices of the six-cylinder or V-8 engines; the four-cylinder was available only in the 100. But, for Chevy II enthusiasts, 1965 is best remembered as the year the Chevy II became a muscle car. A {{convert|327|CID|l|1|abbr=on}} V8 was available with up to {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, suddenly putting Nova SS performance practically on a par with the GTO, 4-4-2, and 271&amp;nbsp;bhp Mustang 289s-at least in straight-line acceleration. Midyear also brought a more potent 283 with dual exhausts and 220 horsepower.

The Chevelle Malibu SS continued to eat away at the Nova SS market: Out of 122,800 Chevy IIs built for 1965 (compared to 213,601 Falcons), only 9,100 were Super Sports. For 1965, Chevy II had the dubious distinction of being the only car in GM's lineup to suffer a sales decline.  It is possible that some Chevy II sales were lost to the brand-new '65 Corvair, which addressed virtually all its 1960–64 problems, got rave reviews from automotive journals and featured sleek new (Z-body) styling along with a brand-new chassis.

1966 Chevy IIs introduced an extensive sharp-edged restyle based in part on the Super Nova [[concept car]]. In general, proportions were squared up but dimensions and features changed little. Highlights included a bold grille and semi-fastback roofline. "Humped" fenders in an angular rear end were reminiscent of larger 1966 Chevrolets, though the 1966 Chevy II and Nova had vertical taillights and single headlights. The lineup again started with Chevy II 100 and Chevy II Nova 400 models.

[[File:1966 Chevrolet Chevy II Nova Sport Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Chevrolet Chevy II Nova Sport Coupe]]
[[File:Chevrolet Chevy II Nova Wagon 1967.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chevrolet Chevy II Nova Station Wagon]]

For just $159 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|159|1966|r=2}}}} today) more than a Nova 400, buyers could choose a Nova Super Sport. Available only in a Sport Coupe, the Nova SS was top of the line. The {{convert|194|CID|L|abbr=on}} [[inline-six engine|inline-six]] was standard on the Super Sport, but any Chevy II (excluding four-cylinder) engine could be coupled with the SS. The Nova SS was visually distinguished by wide rocker panels and a bright aluminum deck lid cove. It had bright SS emblems on the grille and in the ribbed rear panel, and Super Sport script on the quarter panels. Wheel covers were inherited from the 1965 Malibu SS. Strato-bucket front seats were included, but a tachometer cost extra.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt; The ’66 Chevy II sales brochure clearly promoted the Super Sport as the “Chevrolet Chevy II Nova Super Sport,” but the name "Nova" was not used anywhere on the body.  Front and rear emblems displayed "Chevy II SS."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/main.php?g2_itemId=24007 1966 Chevrolet Chevy II brochure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223123404/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/main.php?g2_itemId=24007 |date=December 23, 2008 }} Retrieved from www.oldcarbrochures.com on November 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Chevy II was still the name of the vehicle, but the Nova SS option package replaced all Chevy II badging with Nova SS badging.

The {{convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|153|CID|L|abbr=on}} [[inline-four engine]] was only offered in the base Chevy II 100 series models. Buyers could also order a {{convert|194|CID|L|abbr=on}} inline-six engine (std. in the SS), a {{convert|230|CID|L|abbr=on}} inline-six, a {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|220|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|283|CID|L|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V-8]], a {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|abbr=on}} V-8 and the top engine, a new Turbo-Fire {{convert|327|CID|L|abbr=on}} V-8 delivering {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. This engine was first seen in the Chevelle. This engine with the close-ratio four-speed manual transmission turned the normally mild Nova into a proper [[muscle car]]; The [[Powerglide]] automatic was not available with the 350&amp;nbsp;hp engine.

The 1967 models received nothing more than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked much in the way of trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, front seat belt anchors and dual brake master cylinders, were included in all 1967 models.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1967 Chevrolet Nova SS.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chevy II Nova SS Sport Coupe]] --&gt;

The 1967 Chevy II and its deluxe Nova rendition continued to attract compact-car shoppers, but the Chevrolet Camaro, introduced for 1967, took away some Nova sales. Available only in hardtop coupe form, the 1967 Chevrolet Nova SS got a new black-accented anodized aluminum grille. SS wheel covers were again inherited, this time from the 1965–66 Impala SS. The 1966 "Chevy II SS" badges were replaced with "Nova SS" emblems for the '67s.  Nova versions started with the {{convert|194|CID|L|abbr=on}}in-line six engine but new was an optional  {{convert|250|CID|L|abbr=on}} inline-six. Further powertrain options included a {{convert|195|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|283|CID|L|abbr=on}} V-8 and, for $93 more, a {{convert|275|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|abbr=on}} V-8. Nova SS coupes had a console-mounted shift lever with their Powerglide automatic transmission or a four-speed manual. Other models had a column-mounted gearshift. Compared to the 1966 [[model year]] output, sales of the 1967 models dropped by more than a third to 106,500 (including 12,900 station wagons). About 10,100 Nova SS Chevrolets went to customers this year, 8,200 of them with V-8 engines. In the Chevy II 100 and regular Nova series, six-cylinder engines sold far better than V-8s.

The 1968 models were fully redesigned with an extensive restyle on a longer 111-inch wheelbase that gave Chevy's compacts a chassis that was just one inch shorter than that of the midsize Chevelle coupe. The station wagon and hardtop sport coupe were discontinued, the former in line with an industry trend which left AMC the only American maker of compact station wagons until Chrysler rejoined the market in 1976 (the 1966–70 Ford Falcon wagon was actually a midsize, using a bodyshell identical to the Fairlane wagon's).
One notable change was the front subframe assembly — as compared with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Chrysler and [[American Motors|AMC]], in whose cars the entire front suspension was integrated with the bodyshell, a separate subframe housing the powertrain and front suspension (similar to the front part of the frame of GM's [[full-size]], full-framed vehicles) replaced the earlier style. Although the front subframe design was unique for the Nova, the [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] introduced a year earlier was the first to incorporate such a design; the redesigned Nova was pushed a year ahead to 1968 instead of 1969. The sales brochure claimed 15 powertrain choices for coupes and a dozen for sedans. Options included power brakes and steering, Four-Season or Comfort-Car air conditioning, rear shoulder belts, and head restraints. There were a few Chevrolet Novas built with the 194 ci (3.1 L), the same motor that had been used in the previous generations of the Chevy II. Sales of the 1968 Chevy Nova fell by half. In 1969 Chevrolet dropped the Chevy II portion of its compact car's name; it was now known simply as the Chevrolet Nova.
The {{convert|153|CID|L|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|four-cylinder]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] was offered between 1968 and 1970, then was dropped due to lack of interest (besides its other usage in the Jeep DJ-5A a.k.a. the Postal Jeep or a marine/industrial engine) and to clear the field for the Vega. Far more popular were the {{convert|250|CID|L|abbr=on}} six-cylinder and the base {{convert|307|CID|L|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]], which replaced the {{convert|283|CID|L|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] offered in previous years. Several units were produced with the {{convert|327|CID|L|abbr=on}}, {{convert|275|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, engine, four-barrel quadrajet carb and four-speed Saginaw transmission with a heavy duty 12 bolt positraction rear as a "towing option' package. At mid-year, a [[semi-automatic transmission]] based on the Powerglide called the Torque-Drive (RPO MB1) was introduced as a low-cost option (~$100 less than the Powerglide) for clutchless motoring. The Torque-Drive transmission was only offered with the four and six-cylinder engines. The two-speed Powerglide was still the only fully [[automatic transmission]] available with most engines, as the more desirable three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic was only available with the largest V8 engines.

=== Nova SS ===
[[File:Chevy Nova SS Coupe (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|Chevy Nova SS [[Coupé]]]]
The '''Nova [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]]''' was transformed from a trim option to a performance package for 1968. One of the smallest muscle cars ever fielded by Detroit, the Nova SS now included a {{convert|295|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine along with a heavy-duty suspension and other performance hardware, priced at US$312.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.579.&lt;/ref&gt; Optional [[V8 engine]]s included two versions of the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#396 and 402|big-block {{convert|396|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] rated at {{convert|350|bhp|PS kW|abbr=on}}; and {{convert|375|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm and {{convert|415|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1969/103730/chevrolet_nova_ss_396_375-hp_4-speed.html|website=automobile-catalog|title=1969 Chevrolet Nova SS 396 375 HP 4-speed|accessdate=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went for US$348.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.579.&lt;/ref&gt; Both engines were offered with a choice of transmissions including the M-21 [[Close-ratio transmission|close-ratio]] four-speed manual, the heavy-duty M-22 "Rock Crusher" four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]], or the three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] 400 [[automatic transmission]]. A total of 5,571 SS [[coupé]]s were produced for 1968. Novas sported the SS badge until 1976. &lt;ref&gt;Quentin Willson's Great Cars, p.148 {{ISBN|0-7566-1730-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front [[disc brake]]s were optional on the 1968 Nova SS.

=== 1969–74 ===
For 1969 the Chevy II nameplate was retired, leaving the Nova nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JG1|Gunnell (2002)]], p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The "Chevy II by Chevrolet" trunklid badge was replaced with "Nova by Chevrolet" and the "Chevy II" badge above the grille was replaced with the bowtie emblem and the 1969 model was promoted under the Nova model name in Chevrolet sales literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcarmanualproject.com/brochures/Chev/1969/FullLine/index.htm 1970 Chevrolet range brochure] Retrieved from www.oldcarmanualproject.com  on November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other 1969 GM vehicles, locking steering columns were incorporated into the Nova. Simulated air extractor/vents were added below the Nova script, which was relocated to the front fender behind the wheelwell instead of the rear quarter panel. The {{convert|350|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8 with four-barrel carburetor that came standard with the SS option was revised with a {{convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} increase to {{convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}, while a two-barrel carbureted version of the {{convert|350|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was a new option on non-SS models. The SS option price remained US$312&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.653.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--It appears the SS396 was no longer offered, though.--&gt; A new Turbo-Hydramatic 350 three-speed automatic was made available for non-SS Novas with six-cylinder and V8 engines, although the older two-speed [[Powerglide]] continued to be available on the smaller-engined Novas. 1969 SS models were the first Nova SS models to have standard front disc brakes.

[[File:San Francisco, California - USA (9073500055).jpg|thumb|left|1970–1972 Chevrolet Nova four-door sedan]]

The 1970 Nova was basically a carryover from 1969. The side marker and taillight lenses for the 1970 Nova were wider and positioned slightly differently. This was the final year for the SS396 (actually, a 402 cubic in. engine now). All other engines were carried over including the seldom-ordered four-cylinder which was in its final year.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.726.&lt;/ref&gt; The car finally became simply the Chevrolet Nova this year after two years of transitional nameplates (Chevy II Nova in 1968 and Chevrolet Chevy Nova in 1969). Out of 254,242 Novas sold for 1970, 19,558 were the SS 350 or SS 396 version. Approximately 177 Central Office Production Order (COPO) Novas were ordered, with 175 converted by [[Yenko Chevrolet]]. The other two were sold in Canada. The Nova was used in [[Trans-Am]] racing this year.

Year 1971 Novas were similar to the previous year. The {{convert|396|CID|L|abbr=on}} engine was replaced with the {{convert|350|CID|L|abbr=on}} in the SS model. 1971 also saw the introduction of the Rally Nova, a trim level that only lasted two years (until it resurfaced in 1977). The Rally kit included black or white stripes that ran the length of the car and around the back, a Rally Nova sticker on the driver's side of the hood, Rally wheels, multi-leaf rear springs, and a "sport" body colored driver's side mirror that was adjustable from the interior. The well-hyped [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]] stole sales from the Nova this year, but the compact soon would enjoy a resurgence of popularity that would last deep into the 1970s. A mid year production change was the front door hinges spot welded to the A pillar and the door shell, a design shared with the Vega and later implemented by GM's subsequent light duty trucks and vans which later was used with the S10, Astro van, and full size trucks commencing with the GMT400 a decade later.

The {{convert|250|CID|L|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine was now the standard Nova engine with the demise of the {{convert|153|CID|L|abbr=on}} four-cylinder and {{convert|230|CID|L|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engines. The {{convert|307|CID|L|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8s were carried over from 1970 and all engines featured lowered compression ratios to enable the use of unleaded gasoline as a result of a GM corporate mandate that took effect with the 1971 model year.

After 1971, other GM divisions began [[Badge engineering|rebadging]] the Nova as their new entry-level vehicle, such as the [[Pontiac Ventura]] II (once a trim option for full-size [[Pontiac]]s to 1970), [[Oldsmobile Omega]] and the [[Buick Apollo]]. This was considered to build [[brand loyalty]] with respective GM divisions although the company later fused their badge engineering with [[platform sharing]] to cut expenditures. The initials of the four model names spelled out the acronym ''NOVA'' (''N''ova, ''O''mega, ''V''entura, ''A''pollo). The 1973 introduction of the Omega and Apollo coincided with the subsequent oil crisis where sales of the X and H platform increased.

The 1972 Nova received only minor trim changes. The Rally Sport option with special suspension returned and was a rather popular choice, with 33,319 sold. Super Sport equipment went on 12,309 coupes, some of which also had the Rally package. Nova production moved to Norwood, Ohio, where it would be assembled alongside the Camaro. At mid-year a sunroof option became available on two-door models. Also, the optional Strato bucket seats available on coupes switched from the previous low-back design with adjustable headrests to the high back units with built-in headrests introduced the previous year on Camaros and Vegas. Despite the lack of change, Nova had its best sales season in years, with production of the 1972 models reaching 349,733. Of these, 139,769 had the six-cylinder engine.

The 1973 model year introduced a hatchback bodystyle based on the 2-door coupe. The front and rear of the Nova were restyled, following a government mandate for vehicles to be fitted with front and rear bumpers capable of absorbing a low-speed impact of {{convert|2.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. To go along with the bigger bumpers, stylists gave the Nova a new grille with a loosely patterned crosshatch insert and parking lights located inboard of the headlights. In 1974, they could absorb 5&amp;nbsp;mph impacts. Fuel tank capacity increased to 21 gallons, which required a redesigned trunk pan where a circular section was stamped to house the space saver spare tire used on hatchback models.

An SS option remained available, but it was merely a $123 dress-up package that included a blackout grille and Rally wheels. It could be ordered with any of the Nova engines. 35,542 SS packages were installed, making 1973 the best-selling year for the option. A modified rear side window shape was also introduced, eliminating the vent windows on both two- and four-door models. A revised rear suspension was adapted from the second generation Camaro with multi-leaf springs replacing the mono-leaf springs used on Novas since the original 1962 model. By this time, six-cylinder and V8 engines were ''de rigueur'' for American [[compact cars]], with the {{convert|307|CID|L|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8s becoming fairly common. The 1973 Nova with a six-cylinder engine or 307 cu. in.(5.0 L)  V8 were among the last Chevrolets to be offered with the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic transmission, which was in its final year. A dressy Custom series (which became a mid-level trim package in 1975) joined the Nova line and a Custom hatchback listed for $2,701 with a six-cylinder engine. That was $173 more than the six-cylinder base-model two-door hatchback. Air conditioning added $381. Every 1973 Chevrolet Nova got side guard door beams and additional sound insulation, as well as flow-through ventilation systems. A sunroof could be installed, and fold-down rear seats were available.

[[File:Rm 1974 nova.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Nova coupe]]

For 1974, the Chevrolet Nova got larger parking lights and new bow-tie grille emblems, as well as modified bumpers that added two inches to length and helped cushion minor impacts. The Powerglide was replaced by a lightweight version of the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 350 ( THM 250 ) already offered with the {{convert|350|CID|L|abbr=on}} V8, which was the only V8 offered for 1974. Nova sales continued the surge they had enjoyed since 1972 and approached 400,000 cars for 1974. Six-cylinder Novas were the fastest gainers, as sales of V-8 Novas declined. These were the years of the first energy crisis as Middle Eastern countries cut back on oil exports. After waiting for hours in gas lines and fretting about the prospect of fuel rationing, thrifty compacts looked pretty good to plenty of Americans and it fit the bill.

The 'Spirit of America' Nova was introduced in 1974. In anticipation of the US bicentennial in 1976, the limited edition Nova Coupes were painted white and featured blue and red accent stripes as well as red and blue interior carpets and fabrics. [[Oldsmobile]] and [[Buick]] entered the compact car market; both the [[Buick Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Oldsmobile Omega|Omega]] debuted, using the same bodystyles from the Nova lineup. Additional options were included on these Nova-like models, such as lighting under the dashboard and in the glove compartment. Pontiac's final [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] of this era was based on a facelifted 1974 [[Pontiac Ventura|Ventura]] coupe, itself based on the Nova, but fitted with a shaker hoodscoop from the [[Pontiac Trans Am|Trans Am]].

Novas and all 1974 cars were fitted with a weight sensitive relay within the front seat that prevented the vehicle from being started until the driver's seatbelt had been fastened, following a safety mandate from the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]]. Later, a law passed by Congress repealed the mandate requiring this type of device, declaring that it infringed on a driver's freedom of choice, and allowed owners of 1974-model cars to have the seat belt interlock bypassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Courses/adlaww01/seatbelts.htm |title=The Seat-Belt Story |publisher=Biotech.law.lsu.edu |date=|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devices were not included in future Nova models. Along with this controversial seat belt interlock, a new, more convenient "inertial reel" one-piece lap/shoulder safety belt assembly was standard for both front outboard passengers, along with a plastic clip attached to the headrest to guide the belt across the wearer's shoulder.

=== Yenko Novas ===
[[File:1970 Chevrolet Nova Yenko Coupé.jpg|thumb|1970 Yenko Nova coupe 350 SC]]

Retired [[race car]] driver and [[muscle car]] specialist [[Don Yenko]] of [[Yenko Chevrolet]] in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]] refitted a series of third generation Novas, as well as [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelles]] and [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaros]] for optimum performance to compete with the frontrunning [[Ford Mustang]]s, [[Plymouth Barracuda]]s and [[Dodge Challenger]]s. The specially redesigned Nova (sometimes known as the "Yenko Supernova") had a stronger body frame and suspension system to house the powerful and heavy 427cid (7.0 L) [[V8 engine|V8]] engine that powered the Yenko Super Cars. Only 37 were known to be produced with an original selling price of $4,000.00. Today, only seven units are registered and known to exist. In 1970, emissions standards and fuel economy were taking a toll on muscle cars. To counter this, Yenko requested a high-output Chevy 350cid V8 in his special line of Novas, the same engine that the new Z-28 Camaro and LT1 Corvette shared. Additionally, the new "Yenko Deuce", as it was known, had extensive suspension, transmission, and rear axle upgrades along with some very lively stripes, badges, and interior decals.

The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car for that model year. "Now it's beautiful," said the brochure of Nova's all-new sheet metal, "refined along the lines of elegant European sedans." Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova's efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by an inch and a half, and the front stabilizer bar had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Camaro]] and [[Pontiac Firebird]]), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had fixed side windows (or optional flip-out windows - the first for a GM vehicle later optioned throughout the 1980s with its light duty trucks (S10, Astro/Safari, and GMT400 trucks to the K2XX series) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had cut-pile carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater glass area. Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars. The base model carried the inline six-cylinder {{convert|250|CID|L|abbr=on}}, {{convert|105|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, three V8 engines ({{convert|262|CID|L|abbr=on}}, a 1975-only option, a {{convert|305|CID|L|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|350|CID|L|abbr=on}}) for 1976 only, were offered. Mated to a three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]], 3-speed manual or 4-speed – V8s only – Which remained the norm through the end of the decade (and the end of the rear-wheel drive [[GM X platform (RWD)|X platform]]).

[[File:1975 Chevrolet Nova LN.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Chevrolet Nova LN]]

The LN (Luxury Nova) package (which was the top luxury trim similar to the Caprice and Malibu Classic) sent Nova into the luxury portion of the compact market; some actually thought of it as competing against a few high-end European imports. The Nova LN was called "the most luxurious compact in Chevrolet's history," with wide-back reclining front seats that "look and feel like big, soft lounge chairs." LN equipment included ad&amp;shy;ditional sound insulation, map pockets, an electric clock, a smoked instrument lens, floor shifter and center console, and a day/night mirror. Taillight lenses have additional white accents unavailable with the base model and a chrome plated grille. Above the front marker lenses, the LN had 4.3 LITER (or 5.7 LITER) decals - making it the first Chevrolet product with metric displacement badges sold in the Americas. Swing-out quarter windows could be ordered for the coupe. "Thanks to LN," the sales brochure announced, "Nova's image will never be the same again." The LN was more Eurocentric as opposed to the Custom which became the mid-level trim option.

For 1976 the Nova LN was rebranded Concours to rival the [[Ford Granada (North America)|Ford Granada]] and the [[Mercury Monarch]], as well as upscale versions of the [[Dodge Dart]] and [[Plymouth Valiant]]. Like regular versions of the 1976 Nova, the Concours came in three body styles: coupe, hatchback coupe, and four-door sedan. Concours was the most luxurious Chevrolet compact to date. Rosewood vinyl decorated the upper door panels, instrument panel, and steering wheel. Concours models had an upright hood ornament, bumper guards, bright trim moldings, black bumper impact strips, and full wheel covers; more-basic Novas came with hubcaps.   The Concours coupe also was the first Chevrolet coupe with a fold-down front center armrest. A V-8 Concours coupe sold for $547 more than the comparable base Nova.  Engines for the 1976 Chevrolet Nova were a 105-horsepower inline-six, a 165-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V-8, or a 140-horse 305-cubic-inch V-8. 1976 GM vehicles first saw use of the THM200 — from the GM T platform to GM X-Bodies (Chevrolet Nova et al.). A lighter duty 10 bolt rear differential with a 7.5" ring gear (also used with the Vega/Monza) was phased into production (last produced in 2005) - which was standard equipment with the base inline six. A Cabriolet padded vinyl top was available for Nova coupes. Modest revisions were made to the brakes, and also to fuel and exhaust system mountings. Dashboards contained new knobs.  After testing the 1976 Chevrolet Nova, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department placed the largest order for compact police cars ever seen in the U.S.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1976 Chevy Nova SS.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Nova SS Coupe]] --&gt;

The $187 Nova SS option group included a black grille with unique diamond-mesh pattern, Rally wheels, four-spoke steering wheel, and heavy-duty suspension.

Minor changes for the 1977 model year included a more modern round gauge cluster to replace the long sweeping speedometer, and a revised dash panel which changed to a flatter design.  Some new colors were offered (as with the rest of the divisions) and some small trim added. A separate brochure was printed for the Concours while the "1977 Nova" brochure detailed only base and Custom versions.
The Nova SS previously offered for 1975 and 1976 was discontinued, the option code for the SS — RPO Z26 — continued as the Nova Rally from 1977 through 1979. A badged-engineered Nova Malibu Rallye (1977 and 1978 model years – not related to the USA market Chevelle-based model and based on the Nova hatchback coupe) was sold in Mexico using the RPO Z26 package but fitted with 'Malibu Rallye' graphics and a front grille emblem.

Three engines and four transmissions were available for every 1977 Chevrolet Nova, including Concours. Buyers could choose from a 110-horsepower 250-cubic-inch inline six, a 145-horsepower 305 cubic-inch two-barrel V-8, or 170-horsepower 350 cubic-inch four-barrel V-8. Shifting was accomplished by three-speed (column or floor shift) and four-speed manuals or Turbo Hydra-Matic. Novas might also be equipped with a heavy-duty suspension or the F41 sport suspension. A surprising number of police departments ordered Novas with either a 305- or 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, following the lead of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which had given the compacts an exhaustive evaluation.

Promoted as "Concours by Chevrolet", the 1977 Concours featured a new vertical bar grille and a revised stand-up hood ornament.  The rear of the Concours also got new triple unit taillamps reminiscent of the Caprice. It also boasted newly designed wheel covers and wider bright wheel-opening moldings. "International in style, it is American in function," the sales brochure insisted of the Concours. The brochure went on to note that Concours offered a "very special blending of classic style and good sense." That last comment referenced Nova's sensible size. Novas themselves, the marketing materials said, were "not too small, not too big, not too expensive."

For 1978 the Concours was discontinued to clear the way for the newly downsized Malibu, and the Nova Custom inherited much of the Concours' exterior finery but lacked the stand-up hood ornament displayed by the Concours. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl or Edinburgh woven sport cloth/vinyl. More basic versions of the 1978 Chevrolet Nova had the same grille used in '76-77 and added a gold-tinted Chevy bowtie emblem at the leading edge of the hood.  For '78 Nova was also available with Rally equipment, which included yet another front-end layout: a diamond-pattern grille with horizontal parking lights and black headlight bezels (basically the '76-77 SS grille), plus triple band striping and color-keyed Rally wheels. All Nova drivers faced a new dual-spoke, soft vinyl-covered steering wheel; the same one found in the Caprice and Malibu.

Any 1978 Chevrolet Nova could be ordered with a 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine, a 145-horsepower 305-cubic-inch V-8, or a 170-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V-8. Law enforcement agencies in 48 states were driving Novas by now, as the sales brochure boasted. Production dropped almost 100,000 for the model, to 288,000, making Nova the only Chevrolet series to show a sales decline for 1978. Sales of the Nova hatchback body style lagged well behind regular coupes and sedans, and base models handily outsold Customs.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1977 Chevrolet Nova Police.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Nova Police 4-Door Sedan]] --&gt;
Upon introduction of the downsized GM [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] (later [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]]) [[mid-size car]]s in 1978, the X-body and downsized A-platform had similar exterior dimensions. The roomier and more modern downsized A-bodies outsold their X-body counterparts.

The 1979 Chevrolet Nova marked the end of the line for the rear-wheel-drive Nova. The front end was revised with square headlights and a new grille for the short run;  a modified horizontal-bar grille contained vertical parking lights. New chromed hood and fender moldings were installed, and new front-bumper filler panels gave the front end a more finished look. The Custom went back to the base 4 taillight panel since the 3 light panel was discontinued. The lineup was the same as in 1978; the base-level hatchback, coupe, and sedan, plus the Custom coupe and sedan. As usual, base coupe and sedan proved to be the best sellers. Nova Customs had a special acoustical package including improved headlining and full hood insulation, along with other luxury extras, while the Rally Package returned, this time using the same grille as other '79 Novas. These final Novas were promoted for their "solid value" and "reputation for dependability," capitalizing upon a 17-year heritage that had begun with the Chevy II. Fewer than 98,000 examples were produced.  Regular production ended on December 22, 1978 but some cars badged "Nova Custom"  were built on special order with luxury amenities in early 1979. The final Chevrolet Nova (Custom) built on special order would roll off the line in March 15, 1979 and this would be the end of the rear-drive Nova for good. Chevrolet's compact models were headed into the front-wheel-drive age and for 1980, Nova's place in the lineup would be taken over by the new and very different [[Chevrolet Citation]].

The Chevrolet Nova nameplate returned in spring 1984 as a front-wheel drive [[subcompact]] vehicle for the 1985 to 1988 model years. It was assembled in [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], [[California]] by [[NUMMI]], a joint venture between [[General Motors]] in the U.S. and [[Toyota]] of Japan, resulting in various Corolla-based cars sold under General Motors brands, also referred to as the [[GM S platform|S-car]] within GM. It resurrected a name last used on the [[compact car|compact]]-sized [[rear-wheel drive]] 1979 Chevrolet Nova. The new Nova was a rebadged and mildly restyled Japanese market [[Toyota Sprinter]], a model sold in [[Japan]] as a [[badge engineered]] version of the [[Toyota Corolla]]. Nova shared the Corolla's [[Toyota Corolla (E80)|AE82 platform]], {{convert|1.6|L|CID|abbr=on}} 4-cylinder engines and was available with 5-speed manual, 3-speed or 4-speed automatic transmissions. It was [[Design for manufacturability|designed for manufacturability]] and reached an unusually high level of quality and production speed at NUMMI, compared to other US factories.&lt;ref name=a92-23&gt;Adler 1992, page 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1985 model'''
The 1985 Chevrolet Nova was initially offered only in a four-door [[Three-box styling|three-box]], [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)#Notchback sedans|sedan]] [[Car body style|body style]] and in the Midwestern states. A five-door [[hatchback]] was added shortly after its introduction, and the line was distributed throughout the US and Canada beginning around traditional new-model introduction time in the fall (as were the other Chevy imports, the Suzuki-based [[Suzuki Cultus|Sprint]] which had been first launched on the West Coast and the Isuzu-based [[Isuzu Gemini|Spectrum]] which had initially been available on the Eastern Seaboard and throughout New England and New York State). The only engine was a carbureted 1.6-liter four-cylinder with {{convert|74|hp}}. It teamed with either a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. This was the same powertrain as offered in the Corolla. The four-door sedan listed for $7,435, a rather stiff tariff by Chevrolet standards. The five-door, which added a split-folding rear seat, started at $7,669.  All Nova options were grouped into seven packages, which did away with the long list of optional equipment that accompanied such cars as the Chevrolet Chevette. (Simple though it was, the subcompact Chevette offered nearly 30 options). However, adding one of the costlier packages could easily push the Nova's sticker to over $10,000.

[[File:Chevrolet Nova CL 1986 (14460686864).jpg|thumb|left|1986 Chevrolet Nova CL sedan]]

'''1987 model'''
The 1987 Chevrolet Nova saw only minor changes after its introduction two years earlier as a near-twin to the front-wheel-drive Toyota Corolla. A rear-window defogger was added to the list of standard equipment, while visual changes were limited to lighter silver highlights on the vertical grille bars and a change of turn signal lens colors from amber to clear/white front and red rear. CL models also got red reflex panels carrying the  taillights onto the trunk/hatch, body-colored bumpers, and new aluminum wheels.  The 1987 Chevrolet Nova continued in two body styles, a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback. The four-door proved by far the more popular – by about three to one. Nova's only engine was again a 74-horsepower 1.6-liter four designed by Toyota, mated to either a five-speed manual transmission or four-speed automatic. Though Corollas were priced slightly below competing Novas, Chevy's version of the car could often be bought for less because slow sales encouraged dealers to discount prices. "Slow sales," however, meant slow by Chevy standards, for the Nova sold about as well as the Corolla, and buyers would find that their discounted Nova in turn had a lower resale value than the equivalent Toyota, a pattern that would persist for GM-branded NUMMI cars. Aside from some minor interior and exterior trim differences, the cars were much the same, though Novas had a slightly softer suspension that favored ride over handling.

'''1988 model'''
The 1988 Chevrolet Nova added a sporty model to its lineup of subcompact front-wheel-drive cars. This new 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam got its name from a double-overhead-cam version of the Toyota-built 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Novas continued to share their basic design with the Corolla, and this engine had previously been used in the Toyota FX-16, a performance version of the Corolla. The twin-cam produced {{convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, 36 more than its single-cam sibling. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, as in the regular Novas, but the Twin-Cam offered a four-speed automatic as an option versus the three-speed offered on other models. The more potent engine elevated the 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam into junior sport-sedan terri&amp;shy;tory, but the advancement didn't come cheaply. The base Nova listed at about $8,800, the Twin-Cam went for $11,395. That price included fuel injection, sport suspension, power steering, leather-covered steering wheel, tachometer, four-wheel disc brakes, and wider tires on aluminum wheels, but it was a stiff tariff, and few were ordered (approximately 3,300 Twin-Cam models were built). There were no color choices; all 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cams wore black metallic paint with a grey interior; and there was no hatchback version offered. Every 1988 Chevrolet Nova got rear shoulder belts, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo radio as standard equipment. This was the last model year for the Nova name at Chevrolet. Starting with 1989, Chevrolet pushed this car into its new [[Geo (automobile)|Geo]] division and renamed it the Prizm. Geo was Chevy's effort to come up with an import-sounding label to attract buyers who were not inclined to shop American.

The final Nova rolled off the assembly line on August 18, 1988.

== Reviews ==
[[File:1962 Chevy II Nova Ad.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Nova advertisement (1962)]]

The reaction to the 1962 Chevrolet Chevy II was mainly positive. Veteran ''Mechanics Illustrated'' tester Tom McCahill was favorably impressed with a Chevy II 400 Series Nova convertible he drove at a press preview for Chevy's 1962 models, held at GM's [[Milford, Michigan]], test track. "Flat out, which with [[Powerglide]] was 91 mph, this little car never wavered and even over some rough strips it was one of the safest feeling 91's I have ever driven." The styling reminded "Uncle" Tom of a "small [[Mercedes-Benz]]", and he concluded that "with a little hopping up, a stick shift and its low price, it should sell like cold beer on a hot Fourth of July."

''Car Life'' was even more enthusiastic, honoring the Chevy II with its "Award for Engineering Excellence". "We think the Chevy II, in either 4- or 6-cylinder form, represents an important development in the American automotive field," reported the magazine. "We think it represents a return to sensibility in terms of basic transportation; it is a car of reasonable size, adequate performance and simple elegance." The award was mentioned in a 1962 Chevrolet Nova advertisement. (see right)

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' described the six-cylinder Chevy II as an "ultra-sensible, conventional car with outstanding interior space," but also reported "higher than average" interior noise levels. There were also complaints about the four-cylinder version's lack of refinement. "CR hesitates to recommend the Four for normal use. The Four is an excellent hackabout for specialized local use – if you can stand the vibration." McCahill put it this w&amp;shy;ay: "The four wasn't the smoothest four I have ever driven, but it had nice response and will probably still be running long after Castro shaves his beard off."  ''Consumer Reports'' in 1963: "New last year, the Chevy II has not yet developed into a smooth-riding, quiet, or in any sense luxurious car. It is an easy driving, agile one. By far its most important asset is a body with substantially the room of intermediate cars, but with a very compact silhouette and especially good entrance height."

''[[Motor Trend]]'' called the new Chevy II "a most straightforward car – simple, honest and conventional." Editor Jerry Titus was fascinated with the new rear single-leaf suspension: "How it actually works seems almost contradictory. There is a great deal of body roll, but the car does not feel unstable. The ride is soft and pleasing, but not seasick-soft with the constant pitching and rolling that some cars have." Interior room, steering, and brakes were commended. Performance was rated as "moderate" for a six-cylinder Nova convertible with Powerglide: 0-60 came up "a shade under 16 seconds," and the top speed was reported to be 98&amp;nbsp;mph, but Titus felt that "the car seems at its best below 75, where it did not feel as though it was working hard." The four, meanwhile, took 20 seconds to make it from 0 to 60&amp;nbsp;mph. In comparison, a 1960 90&amp;nbsp;bhp Falcon with stick shift took 21 seconds 0 to 60, also according to Motor Trend, while the 101&amp;nbsp;bhp six introduced for 1961 required 14.3 seconds with stick and 15.2 with the two-speed Fordomatic.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Consumer Reports&lt;/ref&gt;

''Motor Trend'' tested a 1964 195-bhp, two-barrel SS with Powerglide, recording 0 to 60 in 11.3 seconds, 18.0 seconds and 75&amp;nbsp;mph in the quarter-mile, and 100&amp;nbsp;mph all out. Fuel economy ranged from 12.3 mpg in heavy traffic to 19.6 on the highway. ''Motor Trend'' concluded that "By adding a V-8 and bigger brakes, plus detail changes, Chevrolet has made a nice compact even more desirable and a much better performer."

The mid-1980s Nova made no attempt to recapture the former "Muscle" glory that it once had, with the Twin Cam performance variant appearing only in the final year of the nameplate after Toyota had already moved on to the next generation of the platform.

[[File:1963 Acadian Beaumont convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Acadian Convertible]]
[[File:1966 Acadian.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Acadian Coupe]]

While the Chevy II and Nova were also sold in Canada, from the beginning a mildly re-trimmed version was also sold by Pontiac-Buick dealers as the [[Acadian (automobile)|Acadian]].

The Acadian was produced between the years 1962 and 1971. It was a stand-alone make based upon the Chevy II, which was produced in both the US and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://roadtests.tripod.com/canadianacadians/index.html  |title=Canadian Acadians |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold exclusively through Canadian [[Pontiac]] – [[Buick]] – [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] dealerships. Due to the Canadian [[tariff]]s on imports put into place many years before, there was no compact car available to the Canadian Pontiac dealer. The U.S built [[Pontiac Tempest]], which started production in 1961 was not available initially to the Canadian buyer – import duties would have made it too expensive to compete in the thrifty Canadian compact market.  The Acadian was introduced to give the unhappy Canadian Pontiac – Buick dealer a car he could sell in the growing compact market.  During its entire run, the Acadian offered the same body styles as were offered in the Chevy II/Nova, and the cars were virtually the same, save minor trim and badging details.

Originally offered in top-line Beaumont and base Invader trim, the top trim line was renamed Canso in anticipation of the [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]]-based [[Acadian Beaumont]] which would arrive for 1964.  A sporty model, the Sport Deluxe (or "SD"), was equivalent to the US-market Nova SS, and it also featured bucket seats, deluxe exterior trim, and special badging.

Base price for the 1966 Acadian was $2,507. The 327-350&amp;nbsp;hp (L79) was available; 85 were produced. The Acadian line was now down to six models; 7,366 Acadians were sold in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vIN_CgtDuHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=nova+II+SS#PPA58,M1 Nova SS By Steve Statham] Retrieved from books.google.com on November 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It survived until mid-1971, after which it was replaced by the [[Pontiac Ventura II]].

=== Argentina ===
[[File:Chevy malibu.jpg|thumb|Argentinian Chevrolet Malibu]]

In 1962 Argentina offered the 1962-64-style Chevy II as the '''[[Chevrolet 400]]''' through 1974, and the 1968–72 Nova as the '''Chevrolet Chevy''' from late 1969 through 1978, both models overlapping for several years. An upscale model (Chevy Super) was produced from about 1973 with different trim, front turn indicators and taillights, a much better appointed interior with plastic "wood" trim, named Malibu with no relation to the American Chevelle. All engines were inline-sixes. The first and second generations were available, depending on year and model, with the {{convert|194|CID|L|abbr=on}}, {{convert|230|CID|L|abbr=on}} and {{convert|250|CID|L|abbr=on}} engines.

The third generation ("Chevys") were produced with the {{convert|230|CID|L|abbr=on}} and {{convert|250|CID|L|abbr=on}} engines with specially tuned carburetors for sporting models. The "Chevy" metal emblem for the third generation had the same font as the "Nova" emblem of 1968–1974 American Novas, and was, for the first few years, in the rearmost section of both rear fenders. Later, it was moved to the rearmost section of both front fenders, as it was in the American cars from 1969. Sidemarker lights were not mandatory and changed much during the production run, from being deleted, to leaving a small chrome plate, to the same light as in the American cars. Rear deck emblems just said "&lt;small&gt;CHEVROLET&lt;/small&gt;" in chrome letters, obviating the typical "Model by Chevrolet" used in the American cars at the time. The hood emblem was similar to the 1969 American Novas: the bow tie, either in blue or just chrome.

Initially, the Argentinian Chevy used very similar trim to the American counterpart, while more luxurious – a "big" car by local standards. They there standard models without accessories and were often used for taxi service. The interior layout remained the American 1968 version for the entire run. The ignition switch remained dash mounted as the US-mandated [[steering lock]] was not required in Argentina. Power steering became available at the end of the production run. V8s versions weren't produced:  Power windows were not available, tinted windows were darker than American versions, and the darker band on the upper edge of the windshield was not present.

Very popular accessories were vinyl roofs, rally wheels, sport steering wheels, bucket seats with high backs, and tufted leatherette upholstery (many sedans were produced this way). Interiors were usually black. Steering wheels and instrument panels were only black for many years, as were seatbelts. American style interior color coordination was absent. The last year of the Nova in Argentina is called locally "Opus 78" (because the slogan of the publicity) and it was the most equipped, adding simil-leather bucket seats, air-conditioning, power steering, electric antenna, and a new dashboard with integrated central console.

Their Super Sports, "'''SS'''" counterparts were both coupés and 4-door sedans, the latter of which was unheard of in the US prior to the introduction of the 1994 [[Chevrolet Impala#1994-1996|Impala SS]]. In fact, a majority were fitted with inline-sixes coupled to a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] manual transmission with floor lever 4 speeds, a single two-barrel Holey 2300 RX 7214-A carburetor giving out {{convert|168|hp|abbr=on}}  and a sporting exhaust note. Corsa, a local auto publication magazine tested a Chevy Coupé SS Serie 2 and obtained a 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h (0–62&amp;nbsp;mph) time of 11.1 seconds.

== Urban legend ==
A popular but false [[urban legend]] claims that the vehicle sold poorly in Spanish-speaking countries because ''no va'' literally translates to "it doesn't go". This has since been debunked, however, as ''Nova'' (one word) means "[[nova]]" in Spanish just as in English. In fact, the car actually sold quite well in Mexico, as well as many Central and South American countries. Nova was also the name of a successful brand of gasoline sold in Mexico at the time, further proving that the name confusion was not a problem.&lt;ref name="snopes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/misxlate/nova.asp |title=Nova Don't Go |publisher=snopes.com |date=|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A similar story has been told of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Vauxhall Nova]] (a small car that was completely unrelated to the Chevrolet Nova aside from both being built by GM). According to the story, it had to be sold as an [[Opel Corsa]] in [[Spain]] due to the same alleged language confusion. This version of the story is also a myth, as the Spanish-market version of the car was known as a Corsa from the outset. In fact, the car was called the Corsa in all markets except the United Kingdom.

There was also a [[Nova (kit car)|Nova kit car]] designed and built by [[Automotive Design and Development|A.D.D.]] from 1971.  It lost a court case with GM Vauxhall over the use of the name, after it was shown that GM's Chevrolet had a prior claim.

== Novas in miniature ==
From its introduction in 1962, the Chevy II/Nova was a big seller and the '62 was available in {{sfrac|1|25}} scale as a promotional model, as well an assembly kit, from [[Aluminum Model Toys|AMT]].  Both the hardtop and convertible were available.  AMT continued to offer kits of the Nova in later years, and some of these are still current and available at reasonable prices including the 1966, 1972, and 1976 models.  The original '63 Nova wagon was available as a [[Craftsman (model cars)|Craftsman]] promo kit.  It was molded in grey and had a fixed hood and no engine.  They also offered the '75 as the "Nova Pro Stock", featuring a large hood scoop and custom wheels.  The '76, and more recently, the '79 Nova models have been re-issued.  The '79 kit is current, molded in black plastic, and can be built either stock, or as a souped-up  police cruiser.

Other model manufacturers offer Novas from other years, including [[Revell]], which offers both a '69 Nova SS, and COPO coupe.  [[Trumpeter (company)|Trumpeter]] offers a 1963 Nova Super Sport in {{sfrac|1|25}} scale.  Both the hardtop and convertible are available, and these kits are extremely detailed.

In diecast, the '63 Nova SS was modelled in 1:18 scale by [[Sun Star (model cars)|Sun Star]]. These came in a variety of colors and were available in both hardtop and convertible body styles.  Some wore whitewall tires.  In the same diecast 1:18 scale, [[Ertl Company|ERTL]] offered a '66 Nova SS hardtop with a 327 V8, '69 Nova SS396 and '70 Nova SS396, in a variety of colors and wheels. [[Peachtree (model cars)|Peachtree]] made '68 and '69 Novas in detailed 1:18 scale. Although detailed, these do not feature opening doors or trunk. The hood does open, however, to reveal a detailed Chevrolet V8 engine.

[[Pro-Line]] currently offers a '69 Nova body for the [https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/58034-1slash Traxxas Slash], a popular [[radio-controlled car]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prolineracing.com/bodies/1969-chevrolet-nova-clear-body.asp|title=Pro-Line 3531-00 1969 Chevrolet Nova Clear Body for Slash Drag Car|website=www.prolineracing.com|access-date=2019-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body is roughly 1/8 scale, and like most Slash bodies, is made of [[Vacuum forming|vacuum-formed]] clear [[Polycarbonate|Lexan]], intended to be painted from the inside to prevent scratches. (Several companies offer specialized spray paints for this purpose, as traditional spray paint does not stick to Lexan.) Although the Slash is primarily an off-road vehicle, the Pro-Line body is intended to fit a Slash that has been heavily modified for miniature [[drag racing]]. However, it can also be made to fit other Slash setups, or other R/C vehicle platforms with the same wheelbase and body mounting system as the Slash.

The [[Chevrolet]] and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] G-series vans were made by [[General Motors]] for North America.  They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].

The term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].

The G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5" (139.6&amp;nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971–1995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5" (127&amp;nbsp;mm) bolt circle.

G20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC ¾- and 1-ton pickups although using the ½ ton pickup's brake rotors.

A light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20—the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75" (120.7&amp;nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.

The G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.

The first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.

''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a "doghouse" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a "[[cab over]]" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as "Handi-Van".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&amp;nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added "Sportvan", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as "Handi-Bus". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.

===Updates===

====1964====
The original "classic" flat windshield van. The 90&amp;nbsp;hp (67&amp;nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&amp;nbsp;hp (89&amp;nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.
The Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.

====1965====
For 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.
The exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.
The 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&amp;nbsp;hp (100&amp;nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder

====1966====
This was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model "Sportvan" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.

In 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and "conventional" air conditioning (with dash vents &amp; controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.

===1967===
The "second-generation" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&amp;3/4" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.
For 1967, the 140&amp;nbsp;hp (100&amp;nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&amp;nbsp;hp (116&amp;nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&amp;nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].

===1968===
This was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.

The optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&amp;nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&amp;nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).

A column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.

===1969===
For the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.

"Body-integrated" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.

Up front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.

===1970===
1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&amp;nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.

Air conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.

[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]
In 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a "G" designation (G10, G20, and G30).

For the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.

=== Engines ===
The third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982–1995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].

=== Updates ===
==== 1971 ====
All new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.

==== 1973 ====
For 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called "Van-Tastic" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the "Hi-Cube Van." In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.

==== 1978 ====
[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980–1982 Chevrolet Van]]
The front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.

There is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500

==== 1980-1983 ====
All 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.
[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]
Chevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.

After 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.
[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]
The 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.

==== 1984-1989 ====
New swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&amp;nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&amp;nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&amp;nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.

==== 1990 ====
Unlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.

==== 1992-1995 ====
[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]
In 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.
G30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the "Vortec". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The "Sportvan" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the "Conversion" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as "Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc."

==Concept vehicles==
In 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&amp;sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Cosworth Vega''' is a [[subcompact car|subcompact]] four-passenger automobile produced by [[Chevrolet]] for the 1975 and 1976 model years. It is a limited-production version of the [[Chevrolet Vega]], with higher performance.

Chevrolet developed the car's all-aluminum [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] {{convert|122|cuin|cc|0|abbr=on}} engine, and British company [[Cosworth|Cosworth Engineering]] designed the [[DOHC]] cylinder head. 5,000 engines were built.

3,508 cars were made. They were priced nearly double that of a base Vega and only $900 below the 1975 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C3)#1975–1977|Chevrolet Corvette]].&lt;ref&gt;Collectable Automobile-April 2000. Chevrolet's Vega&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Racing origin===
Known at Cosworth Engineering as Project EA, a Cosworth racing engine based on the Vega aluminum block produced a reported {{convert|260|hp|abbr=on}} and powered [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]] and [[Lola Cars|Lola]] race cars to wins in the 2-liter class in their first outings. The ZO9 Cosworth Vega engine is a de-tuned version. Bore, stroke and valve sizes are identical but it lacks the EA engine’s [[dry sump]] lubricating system (unnecessary in a street use car), has a lower compression ratio and different valve timing, and uses Bendix electronic fuel injection instead of Lucas mechanical injection to cope with a wider range of operating conditions as well as emission controls.&lt;ref&gt;Road Test, December 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1975 Cosworth Vega Ad.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet advertisement, 1975]] --&gt;

In March, 1970 [[John DeLorean]], GM’s general manager and vice-president, sent engine designer Calvin Wade to England in search of cylinder head technology to improve the Vega's performance. [[Fuel injection]] would be needed to control emissions without power loss; also stronger internal parts to work with the existing block and the Cosworth head. That summer, DeLorean authorized Wade to build a prototype Cosworth Vega engine. A meager budget, and resistance from managers between Wade and DeLorean, meant low priority for the project, but once approved by DeLorean it could not be killed.

In June, 1971 the prototype gave {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} on dual Holley-Weber two-barrel [[carburetor]]s. At Easter, 1972 GM President [[Ed Cole|Edward Cole]] drove three Vegas for comparison: a base model, an all-aluminum small-block V8-powered prototype, and the Cosworth. He pledged approval from the Engineering Policy Group for DeLorean's request to initiate Cosworth production. Approval of development aimed at [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) certification soon followed, and Wade began a 12-car development program to accumulate test mileage in a range of environments including high altitude, heat and cold, to test the engine’s eligibility. At the GM desert proving ground, the car reached {{convert|122|mph|abbr=on}}.

In April, 1973 the design was frozen and two cars were built to accumulate mileage for EPA emission certification. The press was notified of the program and in August 1973 a ''Car and Driver'' feature alerted the public to an upcoming {{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}} Cosworth Vega. The engine needed more dynamometer time, new cam profiles to trade some high-end power for more low-end [[torque]], and a tubular header to replace the cast iron [[exhaust manifold]]. Although delayed, the project now received higher priority, more engineering manpower and more funding. Chevrolet dealers began accepting large deposits for early delivery.

The design was frozen again in January, 1974. A stainless steel header was specified, to increase power between 2,000&amp;nbsp;rpm up and the 7,000&amp;nbsp;rpm redline. Camshaft lift and duration were eased back and the [[torque curve]] reshaped to a street-oriented peak of 5,200&amp;nbsp;rpm. Project coordinator William Large built two cars for durability testing. By April 1974, the engines ran “clean” for {{convert|40000|mi}}, after which [[hydrocarbon]] curves on the first car rose far in excess of the permitted {{convert|3|g/mi}}, owing to burned exhaust valves. For certification, five months’ durability miles would have to be reaccumulated.

Development resumed, to improve emissions durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution. High-energy [[electronic ignition]] and mandatory [[catalytic converter]] were added; also a [[Pulse Air]] system, functionally the same as an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.
 
Chevrolet required all engines to survive 200 hours at full load. The Cosworth lasted over 500 hours. For a clutch burst test, Cale Wade revved the engine to 9,400&amp;nbsp;rpm under its own power without damage to [[Clutch#Automobile powertrain|clutch]] or engine.  Three cars, in three different configurations, resumed mileage accumulation in September 1974.

By January, 1975 the mileage was completed with no failures. One configuration stayed within 1975 California limits, making the Cosworth Vega the only GM car certified for all 50 states. On March 14, 1975 the EPA emissions certificate was issued, allowing sale of 1975 models. Production began immediately to fill the order backlog. 30 engines per day were hand-built &amp;mdash; two- and three-worker teams to each engine &amp;mdash; in the Tonawanda, New York engine plant's "clean room", originally devised for the ZL-1 all-aluminum {{convert|427|cuin|cc|0|abbr=on}} V8. At the Vega's Lordstown assembly plant, Cosworth production was 1.6 cars per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Car and Driver. October 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Cosworth Vega 0001, the original Chicago Auto Show vehicle, with a clear [[Plexiglas]] hood, is in the GM Heritage Collection.&lt;ref name="GM Heritage Center, Generations of GM History"/&gt;

==Overview and changes==
[[File:75 Cosworth Vega.jpg|thumb|1975 Cosworth Vega]]
All 2,061 1975 Cosworth Vegas were finished in black [[acrylic lacquer]] with gold "Cosworth Twin Cam" lettering on the front fenders and rear cove panel and gold pinstriping on hood bulge, body sides, wheel openings, and rear cove. (Black was unavailable on other Vegas until mid-1976.) Most have black interiors. The custom interior with perforated vinyl seat trim (RPO ZJ1) was standard, with black cloth seat inserts a $50 option. About 16 percent had white vinyl interiors. All Cosworths had a gold-colored engine-turned dash bezel, gold-plated dash plaque with build sequence number, 8,000&amp;nbsp;rpm [[tachometer]], and Cosworth Twin-Cam Vega steering wheel emblem.

'Torque arm' rear suspension is like that of the [[Chevrolet Monza|Monza 2+2]], and the axle, from the Monza 2+2, gives a 3.73:1 ratio from a {{convert|7.5|in|sing=on}} ring gear. A [[limited slip differential]] was optional. Included were GT springs, shocks, and [[stabilizer bars]] (larger at the rear than the Vega GT's); exclusive BR70-13 BSW [[radial tires]] on British-made 6&amp;nbsp;inch, gold-painted cast aluminum wheels with Chevy center caps; black-finished wiper arms, H.D. radiator and provisions for “Fast Steer” option. The Cosworth was the first Chevrolet passenger car with electronic fuel injection.&lt;ref name="GM Heritage Center, Generations of GM History"&gt;GM Heritage Center, Generations of GM History&lt;/ref&gt; Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not offered.&lt;ref&gt;1975 Chevrolet Cosworth Vega Service and Overhaul Manual Supplement&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot line 1976 model was built in September 1975, and volume 1976 production began in December 1975.

A 1976 facelift included wider grill, tri-color tail lamps and extensive body anti-rust improvements. A new [[Borg-Warner]] five-speed manual overdrive transmission with 4.10 axle was optional. The exhaust system had a single tailpipe instead of 1975’s dual outlets. Seat trim changed to grained vinyl, and the optional extra-charge cloth trim seat inserts were changed to a "[[houndstooth]]" type named sport-cloth. In January, a "Sky-Roof" with tinted reflectorized sliding glass and 8-track tape player options were introduced. In February, eight 1976 Vega exterior colors were added: Antique White, Dark Blue Metallic, Firethorn Metallic, Mahogany Metallic, Dark Green Metallic, Buckskin, Medium Saddle Metallic, and Medium Orange; plus two additional interior colors, Firethorn and Buckskin. 1,447 1976 models were built. In November 1975, it had been decided to discontinue the car after the 1976 model year.&lt;ref name="GM Heritage Center, Generations of GM History"/&gt; Total production of 3,508 cars ended in July 1976 with a Medium Saddle Metallic model delivered to a [[Cleveland, Ohio]] dealer. 190,321 Vega hatchback coupes were produced in the same period.

==Engine==
[[File:1976 Cosworth Vega -2673.jpg|thumb|Cosworth Twin-Cam 16-valve&lt;br&gt; 122&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in (2.0 L) EFI I-4, 110 hp]]
The Cosworth Vega Twin-Cam engine is a {{convert|122|cuin|cc|0|abbr=on}} [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] with [[die casting|die-cast]] aluminum [[Chevrolet Vega#Aluminum engine block|alloy cylinder block]] and Type 356 [[aluminum alloy]], 16-valve [[cylinder head]] with double overhead [[camshaft]]s ([[Overhead camshaft#DOHC|DOHC]]) held in a removable cam-carrier that doubles as a guide for the valve lifters. Each camshaft has five bearings and is turned by individual cam gears on the front end. The [[camshaft]]s, [[pump|water pump]] and fan are driven by a fiberglass cord-reinforced neoprene rubber belt, much like the Vega {{convert|140|cuin|cc|0|abbr=on}} engine. The [[cylinder head]] has sintered iron valve seats and cast iron valve seats. Race-bred [[Forging|forged]] aluminum [[piston]]s with heat-treated forged steel crankshaft and [[connecting rod]]s enhance durability.&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet 1975 Cosworth Vega Service and Overhaul supplement-General information&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine has a [[stainless steel]] exhaust header and Bendix [[fuel injection#Electronic|electronic fuel injection]] (EFI), with four injector valves, an electronic control unit (ECU), five independent sensors and two [[fuel pump]]s. Some {{convert|60|lb|abbr=on}} lighter than the SOHC Vega engine,&lt;ref name="GM Heritage Center, Generations of GM History"/&gt; it develops maximum power at 5,600&amp;nbsp;rpm and is redlined at 6,500&amp;nbsp;rpm, whereas the SOHC Vega engine peaks at 4,400&amp;nbsp;rpm and runs to 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Final ratings are {{convert|110|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600&amp;nbsp;rpm, {{convert|107|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,800&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref&gt;Road &amp; Track-March 1975. Chevrolet Cosworth Vega&lt;/ref&gt;
3,508 of the 5,000 engines were used. GM disassembled about 500 and scrapped the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;Cosworth Vega Owners Association&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
''[[Car and Driver]]'' said in August 1973: "Cosworth Vega 16-Valve. More than an engine. A taut-muscled GT coupe to devastate the smugness of [[BMW 2002tii]]'s and 5-speed [[Alfa Romeo Alfetta#GT, GTV and GTV6|Alfa GTV]]'s. A limited run of 4000 machines, each one built away from the tumult of the assembly line to precision tolerances, as a show of technical force by Chevrolet. All of them will be collector's items."

The magazine's ''History of 0-60'' article said a 1974 pre-production Cosworth Vega's time of 7.7&amp;nbsp;seconds was the fastest that year. Testing a 1975 model, the magazine said: "The outstanding feature of the Cosworth Vega is its excellent balance. Roll-stiffness distribution is ideal, with little understeer entering a turn, and just the right amount of drift from the tail as you put your foot down to exit . . . Through the woods or down a mountain, the Cosworth is a feisty aggressor willing, if not altogether able to take on the world's best GT cars."

''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's test of a 1975 version said it "goes like the proverbial bat out of Carlsburg Caverns [...] At moderate speeds, the car is as close to neutral handling as any American car I have ever driven..."
[[File:76 Cosworth Vega 2673.jpg|jpg|thumb|1976 Cosworth Vega]]

The ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' test of a 1976 model said: "The Cosworth Vega's handling is very good [...] All the drivers agreed that it is a far better handling car than those Vega derivatives such as the [[Chevrolet Monza|Monza]] that have been fitted out with V6 or V8 engines [...] We can't resist saying that with the Cosworth Vega engine, the Vega now runs the way it should have run all the time—easy, smooth, good response, good handling: a nice balance between performance and economy. Sweet as it is however, the Cosworth Vega is still way down the excitement ladder from what it would be with another 30 or 40 [[Brake horsepower|bhp]]. Then it would really be something."

''Road Test'' magazine, in its 1976 "Supercoupe Shootout"&amp;mdash;[[Alfa Romeo Alfetta|Alfa]] vs. [[Mazda Cosmo#1975 - 1981|Mazda]] vs. [[Lancia Beta|Lancia]] vs. [[Saab 99|Saab]] vs. Cosworth Vega&amp;mdash;said: "The results are in Figure 2. Read 'em and weep, all you foreign-is-better nuts, because right there at the top, and by a long way at that, is the Cosworth Vega. It had the fastest 0-60 time, the fastest quarter-mile time, and tied with the Saab for the shortest braking distance".&lt;ref&gt;The Great Supercoupe Shootout - Alfa Romeo Alfetta GT, Mazda Cosmo, Lancia Beta Coupe, Saab EMS, Cosworth Vega - Road Test magazine, October 1976&lt;/ref&gt;"The Cosworth is American, and a collector's item, and it came close, ''damn close'' to winning the whole thing."&lt;ref&gt;The Grand Finale. Hot laps of the track...the amazing thing about it all was that the Cosworth was next by a close tenth of a second." (Riverside Raceway Lap Times: Alfa Romeo Alfetta GT-1:58.61 Cosworth Vega-1:58.71), Road Test magazine, October 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

''Car and Driver'' chose the Cosworth Vega as one of the "10 Best Collectible Cars" in its fourth annual ''Ten Best'' issue, saying: "We're talking about historical significance here."

GM Daewoo introduced the "Daewoo Kalos" in September 2002, based on a then-new ''T200'' platform, replacing the [[Daewoo Lanos]] (T100).

The nameplate ''Kalos'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[Kalos inscription|καλός (''kalós'')]] for "beautiful" and "good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 2002 | url = http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/firstdrives/27945/daewoo_kalos.html | title = Daewoo Kalos | publisher = Dennis Publishing | accessdate = 2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally designed by [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]], the Kalos derives directly from the "Kalos Dream" concept vehicle first presented at the 2000 [[Paris Motor Show]] and subsequent developmental concepts at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show, 2002 Geneva Auto Show, and 2003 at the Geneva Show. During this three-year development period Daewoo was struggling financially, with the ultimate fate of the company and the concept vehicle remaining uncertain.

The Kalos was sold in three and four available body styles: a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback from the beginning of production in 2002, and a 3-door hatchback available in certain European markets beginning in 2005. Two different T200 front-end styling designs were sold. When released in 2002, the T200 headlamps were detached from the horizontal amber turn signal strip, located directly below. This detached style, used primarily in South Korea and North America, was used in conjunction with a semi-elliptical [[grille]]. When sales in Europe began in 2003, the headlights were an integrated unit that slanted upwards from the "V-shaped" grille towards the [[fender (vehicle)|front fenders]]. In Australia, when the Daewoo Kalos was introduced in 2003, the hatchback featured the integrated lighting arrangement, with the detached style used to differentiate the sedans. In South Korea, where the detached lights were used at first, the integrated design was later utilized as a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]].

The T200 sedan and five-door hatchback featured a [[swage#Car styling swage line|swage line]] running along the lower body to the rear door, which kinks downward prominently on the five-door. Five-doors also feature a side window in the [[C pillar|C/D pillar]] with a distinctively angled lower edge. Interiors feature a circular motif throughout.

GM introduced a facelifted sedan at [[Auto Shanghai|Auto Shanghai 2005]], designed in cooperation with [[PATAC]]. Bearing the internal code ''T250'' and sold in South Korea as the "Daewoo Gentra", revisions included exterior styling changes, a new interior [[dashboard|instrument panel]] and minor equipment changes, including increased sound deadening.&lt;ref name="topspeed.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/chevrolet/2007-chevrolet-aveo-ar12542.html|title=2007 Chevrolet Aveo|accessdate=2011-01-01|publisher=topspeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of the radio antenna into the rear glass and extensive wind tunnel testing helped reduce the coefficient of drag from 0.348 to 0.326.&lt;ref name="topspeed.com"/&gt;

A [[Facelift (automotive)|facelifted]] hatchback with the sedan's updated [[dashboard|instrument panel]] was presented as the Chevrolet Aveo during the [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt Motor Show 2007]], to be marketed in Europe and North America. The Korean market received its own distinct restyle of the hatchback, the '''Gentra X''', whose bumper without the distinctly "Chevrolet" split grille was also used for the Pontiac, Holden and Suzuki variants.

With launch of the Gentra X in South Korea, GMDAT had replaced engines of T250. 1.2&amp;nbsp;L (1206&amp;nbsp;cc) [[Daewoo S-TEC engine|S-TEC II]] engine was updated with features such as dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) and timing chain (older version has timing belt) system. 1.6&amp;nbsp;L E-TEC II engine has been replaced with an updated GEN-III Ecotec Family 1 engine with new features such as variable valve timing mechanism.

The facelifted Chevrolet Aveo T250 sedan was launched to the Russian market in 2016 as '''Ravon Nexia R3'''. The car is produced at the [[GM Uzbekistan]] plant. The Ravon Nexia R3 is available with the 1.5-liter petrol engine (105&amp;nbsp;hp) paired with the 5-speed manual or the 6-speed automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wroom.ru/en/cars/ravon/nexia|title=Ravon Nexia R3|accessdate=2016-10-31|publisher=Wroom.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chevrolet Cobalt ====
[[File:Chevrolet Cobalt 2013 in Russia.JPG|thumb|Chevrolet Cobalt for Brazilian, Russian and other markets.]]

A version of the T250 is sold in the Brazilian market under the name '''Chevrolet Cobalt''' since 2011. Unrelated to the [[Chevrolet Cobalt|previous car sold in North America]], this Cobalt replaced the aging local [[Chevrolet Corsa]]. The car is equipped with a 1.4 and 1.8 Econo.Flex engine. Although sporting a similar front end style, it is not directly related to the [[Chevrolet Agile]], since it shares the overall underpinnings with the Sonic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/testes/chevrolet-cobalt-ltz-1-4-8v-646041.shtml |title=Testes: Chevrolet Cobalt LTZ 1.4 8V - Quatro Rodas |publisher=quatrorodas.abril.com.br |accessdate=6 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603072909/http://quatrorodas.abril.com.br/carros/testes/chevrolet-cobalt-ltz-1-4-8v-646041.shtml |archivedate=3 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Agile is derived from the considerably older [[Opel Corsa#Corsa B (1993–2000)|Opel Corsa B]], from 1993.

====Development====
The second generation Aveo debuted at the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]], using the [[GM Gamma platform|Gamma II global subcompact platform]].&lt;ref name="insideline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.insideline.com/pontiac/g3/2009/il-insider-pontiac-says-no-g3-for-the-states-yet.html |title=IL Insider: Pontiac Says No G3 for the States - Yet|accessdate=2011-01-01|publisher=insideline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been previewed earlier in the year as the Aveo RS concept, shown in [[Concept car|concept]] form with 19-inch wheels and a ''M32'' six-speed manual transmission mated to a 1.4-liter turbocharged ''Ecotec'' engine, rated at {{convert|138|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gmtunersource.com/blog/news/item/949-chevy-aveo-rs-kills-it |title=Chevy Aveo RS Kills It! |publisher=GMTunerSource.com |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the second-generation Aveo was led by [[GM Korea]], with [[Opel]] engineers leading platform development along with significant input from engineers from Australia's [[Holden]] and [[Chevrolet]] of the United States. The Aveo marked the debut of the Gamma II global subcompact platform.&lt;ref name=GoAuto&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammerton|first=Ron|title=AIMS: Holden gives Barina some muscle|url= http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1673F2714FED2519CA2578BF000127F1 |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exterior design was led by Australian designer Ondrej Koromhaz, of [[Holden]] who was on assignment to GM Korea from 2005 to 2007. Koromhaz described his goal for the Aveo as being a "four-seat motorcycle" and took design inspiration from motorcycles, notably in the Aveo's exposed headlights and motorcycle-style instrument cluster.&lt;ref name="GoAuto"/&gt; For Chevrolet Sonic models built in the United States, the Sonic features suspension tuning by [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette Racing]] engineer John Buttermore.&lt;ref name=TheCollegeDriver&gt;{{cite web|last=Nasser|first=Zaid |title=First Drive: 2012 Chevrolet Sonic|url= http://www.thecollegedriver.com/posts/1535-First-Drive-2012-Chevrolet-Sonic |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marketing and production====
Chevrolet markets the new Aveo under the '''Chevrolet Sonic''' nameplate in the U.S., Canadian, Mexican, Colombian, Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Japanese, Israeli, Middle East, South African and ASEAN markets. In Australia and New Zealand it was sold as the '''Holden Barina''' until stocks ran out in early 2019.

The North American-spec Sonic is available as a 4-door sedan or five-door hatchback. It comes with a 1.8-liter inline-four producing {{convert|135|hp|order=flip|abbr=on}} and {{convert|125|lbft|order=flip|abbr=on}} torque, or a 1.4-liter turbo inline-four producing {{convert|138|hp|order=flip|abbr=on}} and {{convert|148|lbft|order=flip|abbr=on}} torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chevrolet Creates Waves with the All-New 2012 Sonic|url= http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/news/news_detail.brand_gm.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Jan/11naias/chevrolet/0110_sonic |date=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.8-liter engine uses one of few cast-iron block with timing belt; the 1.4L turbo engine uses a timing chain to drive the camshafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.samarins.com/reviews/sonic_2012.html | title=2012 Chevrolet Sonic review | publisher=Samarins.com | date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.8-liter inline-four is mated to a standard five-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or six-speed [[automatic transmission]], while the 1.4-liter turbo has a six-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automoblog.net/2011/01/11/2012-chevrolet-sonic-booms-into-detroit/ |title=2012 Chevrolet Sonic Booms into Detroit|publisher=Automoblog.net |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sonic is, notably, the only car in its class to be assembled in America. For the 2015 model year, the US Sonic added OnStar with 4G LTE and standard built-in Wi-Fi hotspot (includes 3GB/three-month data trial), a 1.4L turbo engine that became standard on LTZ models, and a new exterior color, Blue Velvet.

On August 2, 2011, the Sonic had entered production at [[Orion Assembly]], with the first cars arriving at dealerships in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2011/08/02/chevrolet-sonic-production-gets-underway/ |title=Chevrolet Sonic production gets underway |publisher=Autoblog |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2011 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/60eJex2Q9?url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/08/02/chevrolet-sonic-production-gets-underway/ |archivedate=August 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sonic uses a water-based "three-wet" paint process that eliminates the need for a primer bake oven; this reduces the paint shop footprint by 10%, and uses 50% less energy per vehicle painted. Chevy is the first US automaker to use this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sonicinsider.com/blogs/blake-reznik/53-paint-green-sonic-shrinks-its-footprint-orion-assembly-plant.html | title=Paint it Green: Sonic shrinks its footprint at Orion Assembly Plant | publisher=SonicInsider.com | date=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chevrolet Bolt|Bolt]] (based on a different platform) joined the Aveo on the Orion assembly line in 2016, at a combined rate of 90,000 per year.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite web|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/gm-bolt-idUKL1N1D51Z2 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161108145506/http://uk.reuters.com/article/gm-bolt-idUKL1N1D51Z2 |title=RPT-GM cautiously ramps up Bolt electric car production |first=Joseph |last=White |date=2016-11-07 |archivedate=2016-11-08 |work=Reuters UK |accessdate=2016-11-12 |url-status=live |quote=GM redesigned the Orion assembly operation to allow workers to build either Bolts or Sonics and can shift production depending on demand }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barina sold in Australia and New Zealand was sourced from South Korea and available only with the 1.6 L [[GM Family 1 engine|Family 1]] engine, with either a 5 speed manual or conventional 4 or 6 speed automatic.

====Asia, South America and Russia====
Chevrolet Sonic had its [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] debut at the Bangkok Motor Show 2012 in March 2012, as both a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback. It was rolled out from GM's facility in Rayong, Thailand on July 3, 2012 as a 4-door sedan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrivia.com/section-bizzes-news-10/1908-chevrolet-sonic-drive-off-line/chevrolet-sonic-drive-off-line.html |title=Chevrolet เติมความสนุกสู่ตลาดเมืองไทยด้วย  Chevrolet Sonic |publisher=Motor Trivia |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706161119/http://www.motortrivia.com/section-bizzes-news-10/1908-chevrolet-sonic-drive-off-line/chevrolet-sonic-drive-off-line.html |archive-date=2012-07-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Chevrolet Thailand expected 3 new trim variants; LS, LT and LTZ, in both the 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback models (the LS would be available only with the 4-door sedan) which would run on the 1.4-liter engine with the option of 5-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission.  Pricing is expected to start from BHT548,000 in base 1.4 LS 4-door with a 5-speed manual.  Delivery of the 4-door sedan started in late of July 2012, and the hatchback followed in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrivia.com/section-bizzes-news-10/1929-chevrolet-sonic-price-list/2012-chevrolet-sonic-price-list.html |title=Chevrolet Sonic ประกาศราคาจำหน่าย เริ่มต้นที่ 548,000 บาท |publisher=Motor Trivia |date=2012-07-16 |accessdate=2012-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719083610/http://www.motortrivia.com/section-bizzes-news-10/1929-chevrolet-sonic-price-list/2012-chevrolet-sonic-price-list.html |archive-date=2012-07-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thailand-built Sonic was exported to other ASEAN countries like Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.  Production ceased in 2017.

The Japanese model was unveiled at the Summer Sonic 2011 event in [[QVC Marine Field]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmjapan.co.jp/newsrelease/detail/9140/ |title=サマーソニック2011（東京会場）で、シボレー・ブースを出展 |publisher=Gmjapan.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the Summer Sonic 2012 event in QVC Marine Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmjapan.co.jp/newsrelease/detail/9200/ |title=シボレー、日本最大級の都市型ロックフェス「サマーソニック 2012」に協賛 |publisher=Gmjapan.co.jp |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production models went on sale on November 12, 2011.

The Sonic was assembled in India from completely knocked down kits sourced from South Korea.  It was available with the 1.4L turbo-charged [[Family 0]] and 1.8L naturally aspirated [[Family 1]] engines.  Production ceased in 2017 when General Motors stopped selling cars in India.

===Marketing===
In marketing the Sonic, GM had the car driven in a full 360-degree rotation off a ramp and over an oversized skateboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullane|first=Corey|title=When Dyrdek Dreams to Kickflip|url=http://www.sonicinsider.com/content/when-dyrdek-dreams-kickflip-256/|publisher=SonicInsider.com|accessdate=18 December 2011|date= December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, GM produced a commercial for [[Super Bowl XLVI]] called "Stunt Anthem", which featured 360 rotation with other Sonics [[skydiving]] doing a [[Bungee jumping|bungee jump]] and scenes from [[OK Go]]'s music video for the song "[[Needing/Getting]]." The song featured in the commercial is [[We Are Young]] by [[Fun]]. The Sonic is the only subcompact car sold in North America that is built in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vlasic|first=Bill|title=With Sonic, G.M.

==Discontinuation==
In 2018, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Chevrolet would end production of the Sonic in the United States as early as the 2019 model year, citing declining sales, a competitive subcompact vehicle segment, and a move towards focusing on its more profitable products, like SUVs. It is not known at this point if the car will continue to be sold outside North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/04/report-gm-kills-chevrolet-sonic-production-may-end-this-year/#comment-731392 Report: GM Kills Chevrolet Sonic, Production May End This Year] from GM Authority (April 4, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sonic was discontinued in Canada after the 2018 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM Canada Confirms Chevy Sonic Discontinuation|work=GM Authority|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/01/gm-canada-confirms-chevy-sonic-discontinuation/|date=2019-01-07|accessdate=2019-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2019, the Aveo was discontinued in South Korea.  Chevrolet still sells the Sonic in the US, although for the 2020 model year, the manual transmission was dropped. &lt;ref&gt;http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/05/whats-new-for-the-2020-chevrolet-sonic/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet  Blazer''' (4WD model T-10) and its [[badge engineering|rebadged]] variant, the '''GMC S-15 Jimmy''' (4WD model T-15), are [[Compact car|compact]]/[[mid-size]] [[SUV]]s manufactured and marketed by [[Chevrolet]] and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] from 1982 to 2005 across two generations.

The S-10 Blazer and S-15 Jimmy were based on the [[Chevrolet S-10]] and [[GMC S-15]] pickup trucks and were manufactured in [[Pontiac, Michigan]]; [[Linden, New Jersey]]; [[Moraine, Ohio]]; [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]; [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada; [[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada; and [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

In the [[United States]], retail sales of four-door Blazer models ended in 2004 (but was available in 2005 for fleet sales) all other models were sold until April 20, 2005. In the Canadian market, four-door models of the Blazer and Jimmy were sold until the 2004 model year and until the 2005 model year for the two-door models of both.

The Brazilian variant,  based on the second-generation S-series, continues in production in Brazil with their own sheetmetal stampings as well as in Canada with the Brazilian, Indonesian and Russian sheetmetal stampings). In North America, the Moraine, Ohio plant produced only 4-door vehicles, with both 2- and 4-door models being produced at Linden, which was the main assembly plant after the switch (some time after 1995) from [[Pontiac, Michigan]], which became a full-size truck plant.

[[File:1st-GMC-S15-Jimmy-2door.jpg|thumb|left|GMC S-15 Jimmy 2-door]]
Chevrolet introduced  the '''S-10 Blazer''' in 1982 along with its rebadged variant, the '''GMC S-15 Jimmy''', and [[Chevrolet S-10|S-10]] [[pickup truck]], the latter replacing the [[Isuzu]]-based [[Chevrolet LUV]]. The Blazer and Jimmy appeared as 1983 models.

The S-series Blazer and Jimmy did not feature removable hardtops like their [[full-size]] counterparts and were only offered in a two-door bodystyle.

Base power was provided by GM's 2.0 L [[Cam-in-block#I-head|OHV]] [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] engine, producing {{Convert|83|hp|abbr=on}}. A 2.8 L, {{Convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} [[V6]] was offered as an option (coincidentally this engine was also used in [[Jeep]]'s competing [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Cherokee]] until 1987).
[[File:Chevrolet S-10 Blazer 2-door.jpg|thumb|left|1983–1990 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer 2-door]]
Due to [[emission standard|emissions laws]], a 1.9-liter I4 [[gasoline]] engine built by [[Isuzu]] was offered as the base model engine in [[California]] in place of the 2.0-liter engine, while an Isuzu 2.2-liter [[diesel engine]] (also used in the S-series pickups) producing {{Convert|58|hp|abbr=on}} was offered as an option.

The 1.9- and 2.0-liter gasoline fours and the 2.2-liter [[Diesel engine|diesel]] were dropped after 1985, replaced by the larger 2.5-liter engine. The [[V6]] was refitted with a throttle-body fuel injection system for 1986 in order to improve performance and fuel economy.

In order for it to keep being competitive, the Blazer and Jimmy received a new {{convert|262|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V6 option in 1988 (also used with the Astro/Safari vans, short wheelbase G-series vans, and light duty C/K (1500 series) trucks), based on the ever-present [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|Chevrolet Small-Block V8]] engine, producing a respectable {{Convert|150|hp|abbr=on}}. Power output was increased to {{Convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} in 1989. The 2.8L was discontinued in 1990 for the Blazer and Jimmy where the 4.3L became the de facto base motor (truck models kept the 2.8L), and a 5-speed manual transmission ([[Getrag]] 290/Hydramatic 290/5LM60, sourced from the GMT400) was added to the option list, replacing the [[Borg-Warner T-5 transmission|Borg-Warner T-5]] (T5s were still used with the truck models when coupled to the 2.5 and 2.8L).

[[File:1994ChevroletBlazer-rear.jpg|thumb|left|1994 Chevrolet Blazer rear-end]]
In March 1990, 4-door versions of the S-10 Blazer and Jimmy were introduced as a 1991 model; the 4-door had a 6.5in longer wheelbase (2-doors had a 100.5 in wheelbase - six inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) longer than the [[Ford Bronco II]]) and a one-piece front grille with a painted black insert (1990 2-door S-10 Blazers and Jimmies had the 3-piece grille). This new grille also did away with the separate metal filler panel under the grille, since the grille is taller and took its place. Early production models between March and August 1990 were initially available as a four-wheel drive only; 2WD versions commenced production around Summer 1990. This came just months ahead of the introduction of the [[Ford Explorer]], which replaced the Bronco II; six-and-a-half years after the segment-leading Cherokee debuted with four doors. Snowflake alloy wheels (similar to the ones used on the [[Chevrolet Astro]]/[[Chevrolet Astro|GMC Safari]]) were introduced, either painted charcoal gray or argent silver.

The upscale '''[[Oldsmobile Bravada]]''' appeared later in the year featuring an All-Wheel-Drive package called "Smart-Trak" (using a [[BorgWarner]] 4472 transfer case, shared with the AWD Astro/Safari). Although the first generation S-series Blazer and Jimmy were initially sold as 2-doors upon its original introduction, an episode of Motor Trend TV (c. 1991) stated that the thumbs up was for the introduction of the new bodystyle, and the thumbs down was that the 4-door bodystyle was based on the first generation model, which was in the process of a makeover.

1992 models were similar to 1991s - the only way to tell the difference is the rear back glass (the rear glass does not have any trim to which two black buttons serve as the back glass strut mounting points) and front grille (chrome shell with argent silver inserts). The interior was a carryover from 1991 with the exception of the center console and steering wheel (X-bar style similar to the one used in the [[GMT400]] trucks). Also, the "S-15" name was dropped from the Jimmy. The S10 Blazer also introduced an upscale Tahoe and Sport trim packages, the Tahoe LT, which was rebadged as the LT in 1995 whilst the Tahoe package was renamed as the LS. The Tahoe LT had its own exterior décor with faded lower body lines on the lower rockers along with Tahoe LT badges - this also included an overhead console and keyless remote door locks). Sport package had bigger sway bars, slightly modified suspension and 30x9.5 or optional 31x10.5 tires. Body trim included also black plastic fender flares, front fog lights and spare tire carrier on the tailgate. 1992 was the first model year where the S10 Blazer and Jimmy offered an NP233 electronic transfer case for as a drive train option. This deleted the Manual gear range selector with a 3 position switch located to the left of the gauge cluster in the same location that the rear defrost button would be located on non-electronic transfer-case and 2WD model Blazers and Jimmies (when optioned with the electronic transfer case the defrost button assembly is positioned below the headlight switch). The electronic transfer-case added luxury however there was no neutral position with the electronic transfer case, so the owner's manual stated that the drive shaft had to be removed when the vehicle was being towed. The fuel lines, which were routed on the driver side frame rail to the TBI fuel injectors, were redesigned where the fuel inlets entered the rear of the engine (same as the GMT400). This was phased in because of the L35 option which used a similar fuel line setup. The serpentine accessory drive for the 4.3L motor was modified where the air pump was eliminated and further lightened.

From at least 1991 onward, all S10 Blazers and Jimmies came with 4 wheel [[anti-lock brakes]] as standard equipment. The first two years of the ABS system had axleshafts with pressed-on ABS toner rings which was eliminated during the latter half of the 1993 model year (rear ABS control was done via the vehicle speed sensor). The 2.8L V6 was dropped as an option on the S-10 Blazer and Jimmy in 1990, though it was offered as an option on the S-10 and S-15/Sonoma pickups through 1993). A 5-speed manual transmission remained standard through 1994, but only with the TBI engine. Only the two {{convert|262|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engines were offered as options - the base [[Fuel injection|TBI]] and the CPI (introduced in 1992 for the S-series and [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[minivan]]s; the latter had the "Vortec" logo on the intake plenum).

1993 had a few changes - the center console was raised (with a dual cup holder), and the [[4L60E]] transmission replaced the 700r4. The grille (alongside the S-10 [[Pickup truck|pickup]]) was revised (which was a chrome-plated version of the base work truck grille found on base S-10 pickups), along with the addition of optional 5-spoke alloy rims (for the [[Two wheel drive|2WD]] model - basically a copy of the 3rd generation [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro Z28]] 15" alloy rim).

Although the second generation S-series Pickup debuted in 1994, the S-10 Blazer and Jimmy continued unchanged in 1994. Much like 1993 the 1994 model year added a third brake light and the rear spoiler was discontinued. 1994 was a transition year for many automakers when it came to switching from R-12 Freon to CFC-free R134a refrigerant. The redesigned 1994 S-10 and Sonoma pickups used R134a refrigerant. Despite being nearly identical to the 1993 models, the entire 1994 model year full-size pickup and SUV lineup (C/K, Sierra, Suburban, Yukon, etc.), also used R134a. The 1994 S-10 Blazer and Jimmy seem to have used R-12 until the end of their production run and subsequent replacement with redesigned 1995 models that looked like  new-for-1994 pickups.

The all-new Blazer was introduced in 1994 as a 1995 model year. This time, it lost the S-10 prefix for simpler identification, as the full-size K5 Blazer was discontinued (the GMT400-based Blazer was rebadged as the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]]; the Tahoe package which was the base trim for past S10s was redesignated as the LS.) The Blazer was ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] for 1995 and was also the unanimous winner of the Motor Trend 1995 Truck of the Year. 
Exterior and interior size were increased, bumping it up to a mid-sized SUV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=54 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chevrolet Blazer |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A drivers air bag came, but a passenger airbag wasn't immediately introduced.  This Blazer appealed to more customers because of the less rugged appearance and rounded styling, and many storage spaces—a key feature for families.  It was available with the 4.3 L V6 engine only, and most models featured four-wheel drive via an electronic transfer case; 1997 was the last year a manual transfer case for 4 wheel drive (floor shifter for 4 wheel drive) was offered.
In 1998, the interior and exterior received some cosmetic changes. The makeover offered a new dashboard with larger buttons and more ergonomically correct driving controls, as well as larger door handles, and head rests for the rear bench.  A passenger airbag is now standard. A front grille similar to the Chevrolet C/K pickup line's stacked-headlight system replaced the older single-headlight system, similar to the full size GMT400 trucks. 4 wheel disc brakes became standard equipment, fitted with aluminum dual piston calipers (the front disc brakes were redesigned with the dual piston calipers and 11" diameter brake rotors (steering knuckles now have sealed hub assemblies) while the truck models retained the 1978-era single piston disc brakes originally sourced and shared from GM's G-body lineup).  In 1999, new folding mirrors replaced the old folding mirrors. 2000 saw new front bumpers and the trim running along the sides and bumpers was removed.  For the 2001 model year, the truck received a new center console.

In 1999, Chevrolet introduced a limited edition 'TrailBlazer' appearance package that was available as an upgrade to the LS and LT trims. The package featured gold-accented alloy rims and trim along with several interior/exterior modifications and upgrades and was marketed until the introduction of the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 360|GMT360]] series for the 2002 model year. The Trailblazer's headlamps, which featured daytime running lamps, would be available on various Blazer models until production ended. Upon introduction of the 2002 [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]] and the [[GMC Envoy]], production continued after their successors came to the market, with the Jimmy being sold only in [[Canada]] and, in the 2005 model year, 4-door models sold to vehicle fleets.
Another upscale model was the 1998 '''[[GMC Envoy]]'''. It used the same engines and had many of the same upgrades as the Bravada. The 1998 model Envoy featured an optional upgrade to High Intensity Discharge headlamps, and several other visual modifications. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Jimmy nameplate, the Jimmy '''Diamond Edition''' was launched. Not too different from the Envoy, it featured leather seats with a diamond pattern, special diamond logos, and an aluminum silver plate along lower sides of the SUV.

At the same time, a Blazer Xtreme (only on the 2-door model) was added to the lineup, based on the S10 Xtreme.  This sub-model lasted until 2004.

The second-generation Blazer was officially sold in Taiwan, between 1995 and 1996.

'''The ZR2 Package'''

The ZR2 package was only offered on the 2 door Blazer as the 2 door had the shorter wheelbase. It had a wider ladder-type frame which made its track approx. 3.9 inches wider. It also lifted the Blazer about 3 inches which made it be able to clear 31x10.5 tires on 15 inch wheels. An enhanced front (7.25" ring gear) and rear (8.5" ring gear) axles w/ 3.73:1 rear-axle ratio. Larger wheel and axle bearings. A front anti-sway bar, skid plates, Bilstein shocks, and a beefier rear axle. This package cost a little over $1000 and was first introduced on the S10 pickup in 1994 and carried over to the Blazer in 1996.

IIHS gave a P for poor in the frontal offset crash test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=54 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chevrolet Blazer |publisher=Iihs.org |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Captiva''' is a [[compact car|compact]] [[crossover SUV]] developed by [[General Motors]]. The first generation was developed by [[GM Korea]], based on the [[GM Theta platform]] and derived from the S3X [[concept car]] revealed in 2004. The crossover straddles the entry-level SUV segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chevrolet Captiva Refresh Appears in European Patent Illustrations |url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/02/new-midsize-chevrolet-crossover-possibly-revealed-via-patent-drawings/ |publisher=GM Authority |accessdate=23 March 2016 |date=12 February 2016 |quote=On sale in various international markets under the Chevrolet and Holden brands, the crossover straddles the compact and midsize segments from a size standpoint, while offering three rows of seating, a feature not offered by the North American-market Chevy Equinox.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 2006, it was sold internationally as Chevrolet Captiva, in Australia as Holden Captiva and in South Korea as Daewoo Winstorm until 2011, when the international name was adopted. The Theta platform also underpins the [[Opel Antara]]. On 13 September 2018, Chevrolet announced that it is ending production on the first generation Captiva and replacing it worldwide with the [[Chevrolet Equinox|Equinox]].

Captiva is a front-wheel or all-wheel drive SUV; the engines were supplied by [[Holden]] in Australia, the [[Family II engine|Family II]] naturally aspirated four-cylinder petrol or the [[Alloytec]] Holden V6 built in Australia, and later a 2.0-L turbodiesel supplied by [[VM Motori]] in South Korea.

=== 2011 refresh ===
A revised Captiva range was released in the second quarter of 2011. The facelifted Captiva featured a new front fascia reminiscent to that of the [[Chevrolet Aveo (T300)]]. Other noticeable cosmetic differences included LED turn signals on the door-mounted mirrors, redesigned wheels, and revised side air vents.  The new [[SIDI]] alloy V6 was supplied from Holden in Australia, with the petrol four-cylinder 2.4-L and [[VM Motori]] 2.2-L turbodiesel engines being made in South Korea.

At the same time, the Winstorm MaXX disappeared without a Chevrolet-badged equivalent (except Latin America and South America, which is sold outside of South Korea).

The Chevrolet Captiva was launched in [[Vietnam]] during 2006. The Captiva in Vietnam was manufactured in [[knock-down kit|complete knock-down]] form by Vidamco ([[GM Vietnam]]), with 20% local parts content. From 2006 to July 2009, 8,500 Captivas have been sold in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hung |first=Quoc |date=6 July 2009 |url=http://english.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/business/corporate-news/5301/ |title=Vidamco launches Captiva Maxx SUV |work=[[Saigon Times Daily]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/611iFfPdS?url=http://english.thesaigontimes.vn/Home/business/corporate-news/5301/ |archivedate=18 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellison |first=Edd |date=15 November 2010 |url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/vietnam_auto_industry_101115/ |title=Vietnam Gearing Up for Rapid Auto Industry Growth |work=[[Ward's|Ward's Auto]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/611kEqiqD?url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/vietnam_auto_industry_101115/ |archivedate=18 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, Captivas have been produced at the GM facility in Rayong between 2006-2018. Chevrolet Thailand offered the Captiva in LS and LT variants, with engines comprising either the 2.4-L gasoline or 2.0-L diesel units. Captiva also featured the availability of self-levelling rear suspension, ESC, automatic headlamps, and rain-sensing wipers. Late in 2010, Chevrolet expanded the diesel line-up to include a mid-range LSX and flagship LTZ model. At the same time, Captivas fitted with the 2.4-L gasoline engine benefitted from E20 ethanol support and increased power to {{convert|170|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. On 23 June 2011, Chevrolet Thailand unveiled the updated the Captiva using the new 2.4-L petrol engine with support of [[E85]] [[ethanol]] fuel. New features include an electric parking brake, climate control commands on the steering wheel; and later, the updated 2.0-L diesel engine rated at {{convert|163|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The Captiva entered the Chinese market in early November 2007. The only available engine is the 2.4-L [[GM Ecotec engine#LAF|Ecotec]] inline-four engine mated to a six-speed automatic.

GM launched the Chevrolet Captiva in Japan on 30 July 2011, the first GM model to be released there since the [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|company's chapter 11 reorganisation]] in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/news/110530/biz11053016520015-n1.htm |script-title=ja:ＧＭ、中型ＳＵＶ「キャプティバ」発表　破綻後初めて日本に新車投入 |trans-title=GM releases the Captiva mid-size SUV, the first new model since its collapse |language=ja |work=[[Sankei Shimbun|MSN Sankei News]] |date=30 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z5bAcCNC?url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/economy/news/110530/biz11053016520015-n1.htm |archivedate=31 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holden in Australia and New Zealand have sold the vehicle under the "[[Holden Captiva]]" name between November 2006-2017, after announcing the model the previous September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=12 September 2006 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/009A25A10CC69F7ACA2571E70005BB8B |title=Opel Antara to head Holden's Captiva range |work=GoAuto |accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Captiva launched with the 3.2-L V6 and five-speed automatic transmission, but March 2007 had the addition of the 2.0-L diesel engine with five-speed manual or optional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mathioudakis |first=Bryon |date=9 March 2007 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/04ED90BF5B7B8855CA257299000C12C2 |title=First drive: Good oil on Holden's diesel Captiva |work=GoAuto |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initially manufactured in South Korea, production was temporarily shifted to Thailand from September 2007 until early 2008 while GM Daewoo upgraded its production facilities in South Korea to cope with global demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mellor |first=John |date=27 September 2007 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/2D3080DABB3E68E8CA2573620081B35B |title=Captiva to Thailand |work=GoAuto |accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base setup is the SX trim with the 2.4-L petrol using front-wheel drive; the 2.2-L diesel is optional. The CX and LX variants add all-wheel drive and offer the 3.0-L V6 as standard, with the 2.2-L diesel remaining optional. All three engines are paired with a six-speed automatic.&lt;ref name = "First drive: Holden’s fresh Captiva goes hunting in pairs"/&gt;

Holden announced a minor model year update in July 2012, the centrepiece of which is the addition of [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel capability]] for both petrol engines, thus allowing them to accept [[E85]] [[ethanol fuel]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} A cut in the official combined fuel consumption of the 3.0-L by 10% has also been achieved, with smaller gains for the 2.4-L petrol and 2.2-L diesel engines. At the same time, the base SX received standard rear [[parking sensors]] and the range-topping LX came additionally equipped with heated front seats and front park assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Costello |first=Mike |date=6 July 2012 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/67B6EC8C2F68D893CA257A33000E3462 |title=Holden improves Captiva fuel economy |work=GoAuto |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Middle East ====
In the Middle East, the Captiva launched with two basic trims: one with the 2.4-L gasoline engine and another with the 3.0-L V6. Both trims are seven-seaters and offer front-wheel drive.

=== Discontinuation ===
On 13 September 2018, Chevrolet announced that it is ending production on the first generation Captiva and will phase it out globally in favor of expanding the Equinox. The move had been in the works since 2017, when GM began replacing the Captiva in Australia with the Equinox for the Holden lineup, followed by South Korea in August 2018, with GM’s Uzbekistan plant ceasing production on 12 September 2018. With the discontinuation of the Captiva, GM will allow dealers to sell off the remaining inventory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/09/gm-is-phasing-out-the-chevrolet-captiva-crossover-globally/ "GM Is Phasing Out The Chevrolet Captiva Crossover Globally"] from GM Authority (13 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet TrailBlazer''' is an automobile nameplate used by [[Chevrolet]], a division of [[General Motors]] for their lineup of SUVs. The nameplate was first used as a [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] that was sold from 2001 to 2009 for the North American market. It was replaced by the introduction of the [[Chevrolet Traverse|Traverse]] in 2009. In 2012, a production of a newly redesigned version of the Trailblazer for Asia and Brazil began.

The model went off line in India, because of low sales and General Motors withdrawal in the country in 2017.

== Blazer trim line (1999–2001) ==
[[File:99-02 Chevrolet Blazer TrailBlazer.jpg|left|thumb|1999–2001 Chevrolet Blazer TrailBlazer]]

The TrailBlazer name was first introduced for the 1999 [[model year]] as an upscale trim level of the compact 4-door [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]]. It offered additional features on top of the previously top-of-the-line [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] '''LT''' trim level, including an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player and optional remote cassette player, [[OnStar]], color-keyed front and rear bumpers, side cladding, and front grille, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with cruise control, upgraded alloy wheels, a full-size spare tire and wheel, and upgraded cloth seating surfaces with power front bucket seats. Options such as a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] premium audio system, leather-trimmed seating surfaces with front seat heating, premium alloy wheels, a power sunroof, and gold accents for the exterior emblems and alloy wheels were all available for the TrailBlazer. While the TrailBlazer trim level was discontinued after 2001 when the all-new, mid-size 2002 TrailBlazer was introduced, production of the standard compact [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]] overlapped until the 2005 [[model year]], when it was finally replaced by the [[Chevrolet Equinox]] in the U.S. .

[[File:2002-2005 Chevrolet TrailBlazer rear.jpg|thumb|left|2002–2005 Chevrolet TrailBlazer, with modification to meet Japanese standards.]]

The first generation 2002–2005 TrailBlazer is based on a truck platform called [[GMT360]], with all models having [[four-wheel-drive]] layout as an option with both automatic engagement and the more traditional "2 High", "4 High" and "4 Low" gearings, except the SS model which features an [[all-wheel-drive]] system. The TrailBlazer features an [[independent front suspension]], and a five-link rear suspension. A G80 locking rear differential is available as an option on all models except for the SS which has a G86 LSD standard. An LTZ version, has upgraded interior features (leather), better sound system ([[Bose Corporation|Bose]]), and alloy wheels. All TrailBlazers came factory equipped with a detachable towing hitch.

[[File:06-08 Chevrolet TrailBlazer.jpg|left|thumb|2006–2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer LT]]

The TrailBlazer was updated in 2005 for the 2006 model year. An updated front fascia on models higher than the base version and new interior trim were included with the refresh. The SS gets trim-specific front and rear fascias plus color-matched side skirts.

=== Engines ===
The TrailBlazer comes with an all-aluminum 4.2 L ''[[General Motors Atlas engine#LL8|Atlas LL8]]'' [[I6 engine|inline-six]] engine that produces {{convert|203.5|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|277|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque as standard, or an optional aluminum [[GM small-block engine#5300|small-block]] 5.3 L [[V8 engine|V8]] engine that produces {{convert|225|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque with [[Active Fuel Management]]. The inline-six engine option makes the TrailBlazer the most powerful six-cylinder SUV in its class.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The Active Fuel Management system on the V8 engine shuts off 4 of the 8 cylinders during highway travel and idle to save fuel. The inline-six versions of the TrailBlazer get up to {{convert|20|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp}} on highway, according to refreshed [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.

The TrailBlazer won the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American Truck of the Year]]'' award in 2002. The 4.2 L engine appeared on the ''[[Ward's 10 Best Engines]]'' list from 2002–2005 with innovative features such as [[DOHC]], [[variable valve timing]] on the exhaust camshaft and GM's patented [[lost-foam casting]] process.

* 2002–2009 ''[[GM Atlas engine#LL8|LL8]] ''4.2 L [[I6 engine|I6]]
* 2003–2004 ''[[GM small-block engine#5300|LM4]]'' 5.3 L [[V8 engine|V8]]

* 2006–2009 ''[[GM LS engine#LS2|LS2]]'' 6.0 L V8

=== Trim Levels ===

Throughout its production run, the TrailBlazer was available in several different trim levels:

The '''LS''' was the base trim level of the TrailBlazer, and included a plentiful amount of standard equipment, including aluminum-alloy wheels, four wheel disc brakes, the 4.2L [[Vortec]] Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) gasoline engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, cloth seating surfaces, a full-size, matching spare tire with black-painted steel spare wheel, an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player, a four-speaker audio system, power windows, door locks, and mirrors, keyless entry, a 65/35 split-folding rear bench seat, cruise control and a Driver's Information Center. Optional features included a combination cassette and single-disc CD player or a six-disc CD player, a power front driver's seat, a security system, satellite radio (later models) and [[OnStar]].

The '''LT''' was the midlevel trim of the TrailBlazer, and added further convenience items to the base '''LS''' trim, including upgraded aluminum-alloy wheels, a power front driver's seat, a security system, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Optional features included a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] six-speaker premium amplified audio system, a combination cassette and single-disc CD player or a six-disc, in-dash CD changer, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, a power front passenger's seat, a driver's memory system for front driver's seat, mirrors, and radio preset settings, a power moonroof, a rear DVD entertainment system by [[Panasonic]] (newer models), polished aluminum-alloy wheels, [[OnStar]], a touchscreen GPS navigational radio (later models), and a universal garage door opener system with travel note recorder.

The '''LTZ''' was the top-of-the-line trim level of the TrailBlazer, and added further luxury features to the already well-equipped '''LT''' trim, including a Bose six-speaker premium amplified audio system, a six-disc, in-dash CD changer, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, [[OnStar]], a universal garage door opener system with travel note recorder, a power moonroof, and upgraded interior trim. Additional options included polished aluminum-alloy wheels, a touchscreen GPS navigational radio (later models) and a rear DVD entertainment system by [[Panasonic]].

The '''SS''', introduced for the 2006 model year, was the performance-oriented model of the TrailBlazer, and was based on either the '''LT''' or '''LTZ''' trim, depending on the equipment package selected (see the specific models above for standard and optional equipment, which is identical to those trim levels). The differences included unique interior trim, unique polished aluminum-alloy wheels, a unique leather-wrapped steering wheel with an "SS" center emblem, "SS" emblems on the polished wheel center caps, "SS" embroidery for both front bucket seats, unique premium cloth or luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, and a 6.0L V8 gasoline engine taken from the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)]].

=== EXT ===
[[File:Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT -- 12-21-2011 2.jpg|thumb|left|2003–2005 Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT]]

The TrailBlazer was also available as a 3-row, 7-passenger EXT version. This vehicle was {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} longer and had a higher roofline to allow easier access to the third row of seats. This roof was disguised by standard roof racks. The TrailBlazer EXT platform was given the internal designation GMT370, which was shared with the [[GMC Envoy|GMC Envoy XL]] and [[Isuzu Ascender|Isuzu Ascender LWB]]; long wheelbase versions of the [[Oldsmobile Bravada]], [[Buick Rainier]] and [[Saab 9-7X]] were never offered.

Production of the EXT model was handled by the [[Oklahoma City Assembly]] plant in [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma. The last TrailBlazer EXT rolled off the assembly line on February 20, 2006, because GM had reportedly closed that plant, making 2006 the final year for the TrailBlazer EXT.

The EXT could be identified by its much straighter rear doors (which were not inline with the rear wheel arches), as well as by the circular, metal cap on each of the quarter windows where the opening mechanism attaches, on the 2003 models only.

=== SS ===
[[File:Wikitbss.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2006 Chevrolet TrailBlazer SS]]

An SS model was introduced for the 2006 model year. This was the first time a production SUV wore the [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]] badge.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tuningnews.net/article.php?date=050328 Tuning News.net article on the Trailblazer SS]", Chevrolet Trailblazer SS 9/23/05. Retrieved September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The TrailBlazer SS came standard with a 6.0 L ''[[GM LS engine#LS2|LS2]]'' V8 engine, the same engine that came standard in the 2005–2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|C6 Corvette]], with different exhaust (more restrictive) and a taller intake that better utilized the torque characteristics of the engine in the heavier body. The suspension was stiffened up and lowered from the factory, it had an added air-leveling system in the rear, and it rode on {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheels and {{convert|255|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide tires — all which contributed to much improved handling. All TrailBlazer SS also came from the factory with 4.10 differentials, improving off-the-line acceleration. They were available in both [[rear-wheel-drive]] and all-wheel-drive configurations. About 1.7% of total TrailBlazer production had the B4U SS-package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Huizenga |first1=Paul |title=Storm on the Horizon: Tracing Today's Super SUV Origins |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/storm-on-the-horizon-tracing-todays-super-suv-origins/ |website=Driving Line |publisher=Nitto Tire |accessdate=19 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
[[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|IIHS]] tests in early 2009 gave early TrailBlazers a ''Acceptable&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iihs.org/ratings/vehicle/chevrolet/trailblazer-4-door-suv/2009|title=2009 Chevrolet TrailBlazer 4-door SUV|website=IIHS-HLDI crash testing and highway safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' overall rating in the frontal offset test while 2005–2009 models got an ''Acceptable'' rating.  For 2008 models side curtain airbags became standard. At that time, the TrailBlazer received a ''Marginal'' overall side impact rating - tested with optional side airbags present.

=== Discontinuation ===
The next generation TrailBlazer was to be built on an upgraded version of the current GMT360 platform called the GMT361. It was scheduled to be launched in spring 2007, but in January 2006, GM decided to just refresh the current platform and call the vehicle a GMT360NG. However, in June 2006, GM announced that the GMT360NG program was also canceled due to the large investment. GM decided to keep the current TrailBlazer until the 2009 model year (2008 in Mexico).

[[Buick]] instead got the [[Buick Enclave|Enclave]], a [[GM Lambda platform]]-based [[crossover SUV]] to replace the [[Buick Rainier|Rainier]] (along with the [[Buick Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] and the [[Buick Terraza|Terraza]] [[minivan]]), while [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] got the [[GM Theta platform]]-based crossover SUV [[GMC Terrain|Terrain]] to replace the [[GMC Envoy|Envoy]]. [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] replaced the [[Saab 9-7X|9-7X]] with the [[Cadillac SRX]]-based [[Saab 9-4X|9-4X]], which was discontinued soon after its introduction in 2011.

The TrailBlazer, along with the [[Chevrolet Uplander|Uplander]] [[minivan]], were replaced by the [[Chevrolet Traverse|Traverse]]. GM had closed the Moraine plant on December 23, 2008, ending production of all GMT360 products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081006/FREE/810069969/1530/FREE|title=GM to shut Ohio SUV plant 2 years ahead of plan|work=autoweek.com|access-date=November 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628232225/http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20081006%2FFREE%2F810069969%2F1530%2FFREE|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last TrailBlazer rolled off the Moraine line on December 16, 2008, a week before the plant's closure.  The closing of the last factory that manufactured the trucks was the subject of a 2009 HBO documentary ''[[The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/arts/television/07truck.html|title=HBO Documentary Captures Days in the Death of a General Motors Plant|first=Mike|last=Hale|date=September 6, 2009|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recall ===
In 2012, [[General Motors]] and [[Isuzu]] recalled more than 258,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada to fix short-circuits in power window and door lock switches that could cause fires. The recall covered TrailBlazer, Envoy, Rainier, Ascender and 9-7X SUVs from the 2006 and 2007 model years. The SUVs were sold or registered in 20 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Canada, where salt and other chemicals are used to clear roads in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GM recalls SUVs for fire hazard|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/18/business/gm-recall/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation (stylised as Trailblazer instead of TrailBlazer) was unveiled as a concept at the 2011 [[Dubai Motor Show]], and as a production model at the [[Bangkok International Motor Show|Bangkok Motor Show]] on March 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.chevrolet.co.th/cars/trailblazer/model-overview.html|title=The New Trailblazer Z71|website=www.chevrolet.co.th}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case with the original [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|K5 Blazer]] (1969–1994), [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]] (since 1995), [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]] (since 1935) and [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|S-10 Blazer]] (1983–2005), the second-generation Trailblazer is based on a truck frame, namely the second generation [[Chevrolet Colorado#Second generation (2012–present)|Colorado]].

The second generation Trailblazer is built in Thailand and in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/estilo-de-vida/carros-cia/noticias/chevrolet-lanca-trailblazer-por-r-145-450|title=Chevrolet lança Trailblazer por R$ 145.450|author=Vitor Matsubara|date=November 14, 2012|work=Exame|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329064937/http://exame.abril.com.br/estilo-de-vida/carros-cia/noticias/chevrolet-lanca-trailblazer-por-r-145-450|archivedate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently being sold in some of the Southeast Asian countries, India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and sold in Australia as the Holden Colorado 7 from 2013 to 2016, and being rebadged as the Trailblazer in 2017. The [[Isuzu MU-X]] also resembles the second generation Trailblazer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goauto.com.au/future-models/holden/colorado-7/holden-tackles-achilles-heel-with-colorado-7-suv/2012-06-15/12485.html|title=Future Models - Holden - Colorado 7|first=GoAutoMedia-HAITHAM RAZAGUI and MIKE|last=COSTELLO|website=GoAuto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holden Colorado 7.jpg|thumb|left|Holden Colorado 7]]

Launched in late 2012, the '''Holden Colorado 7''', like the Trailblazer, is based on the same under pinnings as the regular Colorado, however bodywork from the A-pillar back is entirely different. Instead the Colorado 7 takes on the form of a large SUV with an enclosed roof, tailgate and 7-seats. The Colorado 7 is powered by the same [[VM Motori]] 2.8 L [[turbodiesel]] engine and unlike the Colorado, the rear suspension is a five-link system connected to coil springs but retains the live axle.&lt;ref name="Holden Colorado 7 revealed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanford|first=James|title=Holden Colorado 7 revealed|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/196538/holden-colorado-7-2/|publisher=Car Advice|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range consists of two trim levels; LT and LTZ. Standard equipment for all Colorado 7s includes cruise control, body-coloured bumpers, side steps, front fog lights, aluminium roof rails, rear parking sensors (in addition to the rear camera), Bluetooth phone connectivity, USB input, roof mounted climate control vents for second and third rows and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with multifunction controls. The LTZ adds 18-inch wheels, projector headlights, exterior chrome highlights, leather seats, a premium sounds system, a six-way adjustable driver's seat, higher grade interior trim elements and LED tail-lights.&lt;ref name="Holden Colorado 7 revealed"/&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Sail''' is a [[supermini car]] produced by the Chinese manufacturer [[Shanghai-GM|Shanghai General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.com.cn/brandsite/car_sail.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305120110/http://www.chevrolet.com.cn/brandsite/car_sail.html|url-status=dead|title=2011 雪佛兰新赛欧两厢 (Chinese)|archivedate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in 2001, it was sold as the [[Buick]] Sail, both in sedan and wagon form which were both based on [[Opel Corsa#Corsa B|Opel Corsa B]]. Since 2005, as the brand [[Chevrolet]] was officially introduced in China, the car received a facelift and its name was changed to Chevrolet Sail and Sail SRV.

In 2010, the new Sail was completely redesigned. The new model offers sedan and hatchback variations. The latest Chevrolet Sail has been exported to Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.cl/vehiculos/modelos-showroom/autos/sail/caracteristicas.html|title=Chevrolet Sail - auto sedán compacto (Chile, Spanish)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peru, also has been produced in Ecuador,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gmobb.ec/portal/es/web/gmobb/productos&lt;/ref&gt; and other developing countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Starting from 2013, this model is manufactured by [[GM Colmotores]] in Bogotá, Colombia, for domestic and regional markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portafolio.co/negocios/gm-colmotores-sera-fabricante-partir-del-2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130117000305/http://www.portafolio.co/negocios/gm-colmotores-sera-fabricante-partir-del-2012|url-status=dead|title=Página no encontrada &amp;#124; Portafolio.co|archive-date=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buick Sail===
On 12 December 2000, the first Chinese-made Buick rolled off the production line as part of trial production. Series production commenced in June 2001.&lt;ref name=WOC&gt;{{cite book | title = World of Cars 2006·2007 | publisher = Media Connection Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 237 | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This car was the first compact car produced by the SAIC-GM [[joint-venture]], and was aimed squarely at young families. The Buick Sail was based on [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Opel Corsa B]], and the body design is shared with the Brazilian Chevrolet Corsa Classic and India's Opel Corsa Joy. This four-door saloon bodywork was never offered in Europe, instead being intended for developing markets. The only engine choice is a 1.6&amp;nbsp;litre, {{convert|92|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[inline-four engine]], coupled to a five-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/channel3/22/20001212/346562.html|title=别克赛欧今日下线  三种配置售价10—12.5万元|website=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price was under 100,000 [[RMB]]. The car went on sale in June 2001.

[[File:Shanghai GM Saibao panel van rear China 2012-04-08.JPG|thumb|left|Shanghai Auto Saibao SAC6420]]
In December 2001, the wagon version, Buick Sail S-RV, was also introduced to the Chinese consumers. Basically this vehicle is also a body variation of the Opel Corsa B. The engine is the same as the Sail sedan. In June 2002, [[SAIC Motor|SAIC]] subsidiary SAIC-Yizheng introduced a locally built version of the Corsa-based [[Opel Combo#B|Opel Combo]] glazed tallboy van as the "Shanghai Auto (Shangqi) ''Saibao'' SAC6420" (上汽赛宝).&lt;ref name=WOC/&gt; Equipped with the same 1.6 litre engine and five-speed manual transmission as the [[Buick Sail]] (albeit only with {{convert|90|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), it was produced in fairly small numbers (2,053 cars in 2004, for instance&lt;ref name=WOC/&gt;) until 2005. "Saibao" has sometimes been anglicized as "Sabre". There was also a Saibao DeLuxe version available, with alloy wheels and other extras. The Saibao could reach {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=TychoSaibao&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.carnewschina.com/2011/12/08/spotted-in-china-shanghai-auto-saibao-panel-van/ | publisher = CarNewsChina.com | first = Tycho | last = De Feyter | date = 2011-12-08 | title = Spotted in China: Shanghai Auto Saibao panel van }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, the Chevrolet brand was introduced to China, where it was described as a "younger" brand than Buick. As part of an endeavour to redefine the brand image of Buick, the Sail became the first Chinese-built Chevrolet passenger car.&lt;ref name=WOC2&gt;''World of Cars 2006·2007'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; The Chevrolet Sail (SGM7165) received a locally upgraded design. The interior was also refined. Both sedan and wagon (now the SGM7166) forms were kept, although production of the Saibao Van ended. While sharing the original's wheelbase, the new wagon version (at 4,097&amp;nbsp;mm) is 71&amp;nbsp;mm longer than the old one's 4,026&amp;nbsp;mm. The 90&amp;nbsp;PS, 1.6 litre-engine option remained unchanged, while the transmission options originally were limited to a five-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] but were later joined by a four-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. Claimed top speed for the manual versions is {{convert|177|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;''World of Cars 2006·2007'', p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 2006, the Chevrolet Sail was exported to Chile as the '''Chevrolet Corsa Plus'''. The Corsa Plus includes dual front airbags, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, electric windows and central locking as standard equipment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The production in Shanghai-GM ceased at the beginning of 2009, but at the same time the '''[[Chevrolet Classic]]''' and its wagon version '''Chevrolet Classic SW''' adopted the design of the Chevrolet Sail and were released in Latin America as the 2010 model year. The sedan version has been produced in Argentina until the October 2016, but it was equipped with different engines. In Argentina, the Classic was powered by a 1.4 L 8V 69&amp;nbsp;kW engine. The model offered in Brazil had a 1.0 L Flexpower engine, of which the output is 56.7&amp;nbsp;kW when fueled with gasoline, or 57.4&amp;nbsp;kW with alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chevrolet.com.ar/vehiculos/modelos-showroom/autos/classic-4-puertas/detalle-motor.html Chevrolet Classic 4 Puertas (Argentina, Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.com.br/veiculos/todos-os-modelos/carros/classic/Ficha-Tecnica/motorizacao-freios.html|title=Chevrolet Classic (Brazil, Portuguese)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

The Sail is also marketed on the Pacific coast of South America, in [[Chile]],&lt;ref name="Chevrolet-CL_Sail"/&gt; [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name="GM-Media-CO_vehiculos-Sail"/&gt; It is assembled from CKD-kits by [[:es:General Motors OBB|General Motors of Ecuador]],&lt;ref name="GM-Media_EC_vehiculos-Sail"/&gt; and also manufactured at least of 90% in Colombia by [[GM Colmotores]] in his factory on the [[:es:Zona Franca de Bogotá|Free Zone of Bogotá]].&lt;ref name="GM-Media-CO_vehiculos-SailCo"/&gt;

====Philippines====
Chevrolet have decided to unleash their new compact sedan in at the upcoming 2016 Manila International Auto Show. This entry level car is the manufacturer’s newest voyage to capitalize on the heavy demand for sedans in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chevrolet All Set To Entice Philippines at MIAS|url = http://www.carbay.ph/en/car-news/chevrolet-all-set-to-entice-philippines-at-mias-21149696|website = CarBay Philippines|accessdate = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 [[Auto Guangzhou|Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition]], GM showed an [[Electric vehicle|EV]] version of the Sail Hatchback called the Springo EV.&lt;ref name="GM-Media-CN_2010-12-20"/&gt; Although this concept car does not wear a Chevrolet badge, it is still a part of Chevrolet's worldwide electric vehicle strategy.&lt;ref name="GM-Media_2011-10-12"/&gt; According to GM's press release this car has a 65&amp;nbsp;kW motor which has a maximum torque of 220 Nm. Top speed is about 130&amp;nbsp;km/h and the driving range with full battery is claimed as 150&amp;nbsp;km. It was also reported that this car had reached the electric vehicle safety requirements set by SAE and ISO.

[[Shanghai General Motors]] introduced the Sail Springo EV at the 2012 [[Auto Guangzhou]]. The [[electric car]] is scheduled to be sold in [[Shanghai]] in 2013 as part of a trial program, and initially only a limited number of cars will be available. The Springo EV has a [[all-electric range|range]] of {{Convert|130|km|abbr=on}} and up to {{Convert|200|km|abbr=on}} at a constant speed of {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}.

The third generation Chevrolet Sail was presented for the first time in November 2014, at the [[Guangzhou Auto Show]] and commenced production in December 2014. It is based on a new small car platform developed by [[Shanghai GM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mostreliablecarbrands.com/the-new-chevrolet-sail-comes-to-peru/|title=The new Chevrolet Sail comes to Peru &amp;#124; Most Reliable Car Brands}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopts Chevrolet's new design language, with the dual-port grille and the eagle eye-shaped headlamps.&lt;ref name="cadillac"/&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Traverse''' is a seven or eight seat [[full-size]] [[crossover SUV]] built by [[General Motors]]. It is built on the same platform as the [[GMC Acadia]] and [[Buick Enclave]] ([[GM Lambda platform|Lambda]] for first generation, [[GM Epsilon Platform#C1XX|C1XX]] for second generation). It is the successor to the [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer]] SUV and [[Chevrolet Uplander|Uplander]] minivan.

Originally marketed as a [[Full-size SUV|full-size]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chevrolet.com/suvs/traverse-mid-size-suv|title=Chevrolet Traverse: Mid Size Crossover SUV}}&lt;/ref&gt; crossover SUV, the Traverse was built at GM's Spring Hill, Tennessee, assembly plant during 2009, but then production of the Traverse had moved to GM's Delta Township, Michigan, assembly plant in 2010.

The 2009 Chevrolet Traverse debuted at the 2008 [[Chicago Auto Show]] and the Traverse had arrived at every Chevrolet dealer in October 2008.

The second generation model debuted in showrooms in the summer of 2017. Starting with the 2019 model year, the Traverse was slotted above the new mid-size [[Chevrolet Blazer (crossover)|Chevrolet Blazer]] as part of Chevrolet's plans to expand its CUV lineup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2018/jun/0621-2019-blazer.html “BOLD DESIGN DEFINES 2019 CHEVROLET BLAZER”] from Chevrolet (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chevrolet Traverse features the [[GM High Feature engine#LLT|LLT]] engine, a {{convert|3564|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[V6 engine|V6]] with [[Variable valve timing|VVT]] and [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]].&lt;ref name=2009specs&gt;{{cite press|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/us/chevrolet/en/product_services/r_trucks/r_c_traverse/09index.html#specs |title=2009 Chevrolet Traverse |publisher=GM |date=2008-06-09 |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other Lambda-based vehicles also have this powertrain in the 2009 model year.  A 6-speed [[automatic transmission]] gives power to the front or all wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|publisher=GM|title=2009 Chevrolet Traverse, with Enhanced Powertrain, Delivers Efficient, Responsive and Safe Driving Experience|url=http://archives.media.gm.com/us/gm/en/news/events/autoshows/08chicago/brands/chevrolet080206/08_Chicago_09_Chevrolet_Traverse%20Driving_R.html|date=February 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Traverse delivers {{convert|281|hp|abbr=on}} with the torque at 266&amp;nbsp;lb·ft. in the LS and LT models. The LTZ model, with dual exhaust, delivers {{convert|288|hp|abbr=on}} and the torque comes in at 270&amp;nbsp;lb·ft.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Traverse received a 2.0L 4-cylinder Turbo engine for the 2018 model year (RPO code LTG), available only on the RS trim level.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/gm-discontinues-2-0l-turbo-engine-in-chevrolet-traverse/|title=GM Discontinues 2.0L Turbo Engine In Chevrolet Traverse|website=GM Authority|access-date=2019-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2.0L 4-cylinder Turbo engine was short-lived, with Chevrolet discontinuing the engine for the Traverse in April 2019.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  2018 also saw an updated 3.6L V6 engine (RPO code LFY).

== Design ==
The Traverse name was originally used for a [[concept car]] at the 2003 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit, but that concept gave way when the [[Chevrolet Equinox]] launched for the 2005 model year.  The production Traverse's design was inspired by the 2005 [[Chevrolet Sequel]] concept, and has a [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]-shaped grille similar to the 2008 [[Chevrolet Malibu]]. The Traverse has unique sheet metal different from the other Lambda crossovers, with the exception of the doors.

== Marketing ==
The Traverse was part of a [[product placement]] by GM in the NBC drama ''[[My Own Worst Enemy (TV series)|My Own Worst Enemy]]'', along with the new [[Chevrolet Camaro]]; the show was cancelled in mid-November 2008. The vehicle also appears on the remake of ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''[[The Mentalist]]''.

The Traverse is also used in the Minnie Van Service in conjunction with [[Lyft]] at the [[Walt Disney World]] Resort in Florida.

Gothic black colors of the Chevrolet Traverse are commonly used by federal agencies, such as Secret Service.

===2010===
On the LT models, the early 2010 update removed the "TRAVERSE" badges on the front doors. Beginning on late 2010 models, the GM logos were removed from the vehicle's front doors.

=== 2013 facelift ===
A [[facelift (automobile)|facelift]] of the Chevrolet Traverse was unveiled at the 2012 [[New York International Auto Show]]. The 2013 Traverse receives a new grille and front fascia, a redesigned rear liftgate, and reworked [[Camaro]]-inspired tail lights, and the transmission has been reworked for improved shift quality and timing. Pictures were released by GM on March 28, 2012. Chevrolet's new color [[touchscreen]] and [[MyLink]] [[radios]] are standard, as well as wood interior trim. Both [[cloth]] and [[leather]] seating surfaces will be available, depending on the model. Cloth is standard on the LS and 1LT models, and leather is standard on the LTZ. Both are available on the 2LT model. Some new wheels will be available, and models will continue to be offered in both [[front-wheel drive]] and [[all-wheel drive]] versions, ranging from the base LS to the top-of-the-line LTZ. Base price for the 2013 Traverse LS is at $30,510. A [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] audio system will be standard on 2LT and LTZ models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2012/03/2013-chevrolet-traverse-at-2012-new-york-auto-show-.html#more |title=2013 Chevrolet Traverse at the 2012 New York Auto Show - KickingTires |publisher=Blogs.cars.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= John Neff RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/28/2013-chevy-traverse-debuts-with-new-face-minor-tweaks/ |title=2013 Chevy Traverse debuts with new face, minor tweaks |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
While there were no cosmetic changes made for the 2014 model year, Chevrolet did add new features to the Traverse: Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning.  Also, the audio system feature was updated, with a dual charge USB port now located at the rear of the center console.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/06/2014-chevrolet-traverse-gets-one-new-feature-rpo-central/ "2014 Chevrolet Traverse Gets One New Feature: RPO Central"] from GM Authority (June 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
No cosmetic changes. Only two new features, a revised 18-inch wheel appearance and Siri Eyes Free, were added. Siren Red Tintcoat, Sable Metallic, and Blue Velvet Metallic became available as exterior colors, while Ebony/Saddle Up became available as an interior color option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/Traverse/2015.html 2015 Chevrolet Traverse] from GM Media (Posted August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
The 2016 Traverse received minor changes. The trim level were reduced to LS, LT1, LT2, and LTZ. New features include OnStar 4G LTE connectivity with Wi-Fi hotspot, Iridescent Pearl and Mosaic Black Metallic as color palettes, Leather and Driver Confidence Packages for the LT trims, and 20-inch aluminum wheel designs, painted and machined finishes.

===2017===
For the 2017 model year, the Traverse LTZ trim is renamed to Premier. However, most of the features from the 2016 model year Traverse had been carried over to the 2017 Traverse models.

On January 9, 2017, General Motors unveiled the second generation Traverse at the 2017 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]]. Introduced as a 2018 model, it went on sale in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/09/2018-chevy-traverse-crossover-detroit/ "The 2018 Chevy Traverse is roomier and looks stronger"] from Autoblog (January 9, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; While Chevrolet is making the vehicle available in North America, plans include expanding the Traverse to the Middle East, and selected South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/chevrolet/traverse/2018-chevrolet-traverse/ 2018 Chevrolet Traverse information, specs, details] from GM Authority (January 31, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The Traverse was launched to the Russian market in 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wroom.ru/news/7551 |title=Объявлены российские цены большого кроссовера Chevrolet Traverse |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=4 April 2018 |website=Wroom.ru |publisher= |access-date=4 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sold in [[South Korea]] in the second half of 2019, where it is touted as a "Super SUV" and its largest Crossover SUV in that region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/09/gm-launches-chevrolet-traverse-in-south-korea/ "GM Launches Chevrolet Traverse in South Korea"] from GM Authority (September 26, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/06/chevrolet-traverse-heading-to-south-korea/ “Chevrolet Traverse Heading To South Korea”] from GM Authority (June 29, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/gm-to-launch-chevrolet-traverse-colorado-in-korea/ "GM to Launch Chevrolet Traverse, Colorado, In Korea"] from GM Authority (April 5, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

The updated Traverse abandoned the egg-shaped design and now adopts a more truck-like design, similar to the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]], while taking some cues from the now mid-size Acadia, with the Chevrolet front grille design. It is similar in dimension to the first generation model, adding an extra 2.0 inches of wheelbase and 0.7 inch more overall length, and it loses {{convert|111|lb|kg}} to come in at a weight of {{convert|4362|lb|kg}}.  It remains an 8-seat (or 7-seat optional) passenger vehicle. As part of GM's plans to expand its range of crossovers by size in order to be competitive within the segments, Chevrolet re-positioned the Traverse as a full-size crossover SUV this time around due to the launch of the mid-size [[Chevrolet Blazer (crossover)|Blazer]] that debuted in 2019.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2018/02/28/chevy-blazer-midsize-suv-spy-photos/#slide-7259783 Is this a new Blazer? Chevy midsize SUV spied inside and out] from Autoblog (March 1, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/04/2019-blazer-spy-shots-show-new-chevy-crossover-will-be-very-similar-to-gmc-acadia/ “Spy Shots Show New Chevy Crossover Will Be Similar To GMC Acadia”] from GM Authority (April 5, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 5 trim levels available for the 2nd generation Traverse: L, LS, LT, Premier, and High Country (see below for trim level content). All the trim levels are available in either Front Wheel Drive (FWD) or All Wheel Drive (AWD) drive type configurations except for the L trim level which is only available in FWD and the High Country trim level which is only available in AWD. In an addition, there are 2 types of AWD system available for this generation of Traverse: the standard AWD system that allows user to disconnect the prop-shaft until rear traction is needed and the twin-clutch Twinster version (available only with High Country trim) with two rear clutches to more directly apply torque to the rear wheel that needs it most, both are developed by [[GKN Driveline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/traverse/2018/2018-chevrolet-traverse-first-look-going-truckier-look/ |title=2018 CHEVROLET TRAVERSE FIRST LOOK: GOING FOR A TRUCKIER LOOK |author=Priddle, Alisa |date=8 January 2017 |website=Motortrend.com |publisher=MotorTrend Magazine |access-date=12 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At introductory period, the new 310-horsepower 3.6L V6 gasoline engine will be the only available engine option, mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission with either Front Wheel Drive or All Wheel Drive. Additionally, a turbocharged four-cylinder engine will also become available in early 2018 with the introduction of the RS model.

The new Traverse gains some new technology, some of which is currently available on other models such as the [[Chevrolet Equinox]], [[Chevrolet Tahoe]], and [[Chevrolet Suburban]]. Some of this technology includes: a hands-free power tailgate, the latest-generation [[Chevrolet]] [[MyLink]] infotainment systems with standard [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]], a power-folding 60/40 split third-row rear bench seat, and standard keyless access with push-button start.

===MY 2019===

There were no major changes. The Saddle Brown Metallic color will be replaced by Havana Brown Metallic and the Roadside Assistance package is available on all trim levels. The Blackout Package is added as an available option on LS, LT, and Premier trim levels. The 2019 model year Traverse will also be the final year that the 2.0L I-4 LTG turbo engine is being offered for this vehicle.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/gm-discontinues-2-0l-turbo-engine-in-chevrolet-traverse/ “GM Discontinues 2.0L Turbo Engine In Chevrolet Traverse”] from GM Authority (April 21, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===MY 2020===

The 2.0L I-4 LTG turbo engine (which is exclusive on the RS trim level) will be discontinued for the 2020 model year (starting midway through the 2019 model year) and will be replaced by a 3.6L V6 gasoline engine which is already standard on other trim levels.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Also the MyLink system will be replaced by Infotainment 3 system and buckle-to-drive feature will also be added to the teen driver system standard on all trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/chevrolet/traverse&lt;/ref&gt; Three new colors (Stone Gray Metallic, Black Cherry Metallic, and Midnight Blue Metallic) were also added to the color palette for the 2020 model year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chevrolet.com/suvs/traverse&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trax came to the United States as a 2015 model, buoyed by the success of the [[Buick Encore]] (the Trax and Encore share the GM Gamma II platform) and possible competition from the [[Jeep Renegade (BU)|Jeep Renegade]].&lt;ref name=autonews&gt;{{cite news|last=Colias|first=Mike|title=Chevy enters small crossover segment with the Trax|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140415/OEM04/140419889/chevy-enters-small-crossover-segment-with-the-trax?cciid=email-autonews-blast&amp;r=1916C1413689E1U|accessdate=April 15, 2014|newspaper=Automotive News|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US-market Trax is largely unchanged from the global version, but has some US-specific features including [[OnStar]] with [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] and [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio.

The US version is powered by the 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 with {{convert|138|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4,900 rpm and {{convert|148|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 1,850 rpm. Trailer towing is not recommended. Only the 6-speed automatic transmission is available.

Three trim levels, both available with front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive, are available: LS, LT and LTZ. Standard features on all trims include air conditioning; power windows; split-folding rear seat; tilting and telescoping steering-wheel; ABS; ESP; front, front and rear side, side-curtain airbags, and knee airbags; tire-pressure monitor; emergency communication system and parking assist.

===2017 facelift===

[[File:2018 Chevrolet Trax LT 1.4L rear 3.15.19.jpg|thumb|right|MY17 facelift]]
Chevrolet performed a mid-cycle update on the Trax for the 2017 model year, first unveiled at the 2016 [[Chicago Auto Show]] on February 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/02/hot-or-not-2017-chevrolet-trax/|title=Hot Or Not: 2017 Chevrolet Trax|last=Szymkowski|first=Sean|work=GM Authority|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated Trax carried Chevrolet's Corvette-inspired design cues from the [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]] and [[Chevrolet Volt|Volt]], including new halogen projector headlights, LED daytime running lights, dual taillights and a new grille design. A set of 18-inch aluminum wheels are offered on the Premier model trim. The interior is also redesigned with a new dashboard and center instrument panel. Overall, the 2017 facelift improves the Trax's perceived quality.&lt;ref&gt;http://motoringuru.com.au/car-reviews/2017-holden-trax-lt-review/&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 Trax went on sale in the fall of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/gm/chevrolet/trax/2017-trax/|title=2017 Chevrolet Trax|work=GM Authority|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuation in North America===
The Trax will continue unchanged for the 2020 model year in North America.  While a replacement was expected, it will instead be joined by a slightly larger model, the [[Chevrolet Trailblazer (crossover)|TrailBlazer]] (no relation to the previous North American or international mid-sized SUVs of the same name).  Debuting in early 2020 for the 2021 model year, it will slot between the Trax and Equinox in Chevrolet's small SUV lineup.&lt;ref&gt;https://autoweek.com/article/family/2021-chevrolet-trailblazer-here-tread-trails-blazer-too-big-take&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2020, Chevrolet confirmed that the Trax will return for the 2021 model year, but will see the Premier level deleted from the offering trims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/03/chevrolet-trax-to-stick-around-for-2021-model-year-with-changes/ “Chevrolet Trax To Stick Around For 2021 Model Year With Changes”] from GM Authority (March 2, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the Trax was replaced by the new [[Chevrolet Tracker (China)|Tracker]] in 2019.  It is the same size as the Trax, but built on a new platform (GEM) for emerging markets and not intended for North America.

==Name variations==
===Holden Trax (2013–2020)===
In Australia and the overall [[Oceania]] market, the Chevrolet Trax is offered under the [[Holden]] brand, as Holden is the Australian GM subsidiary.&lt;ref name="Autoblog_2012-06-07"/&gt; It went on sale in 2013.&lt;ref name="Drive-com-au"/&gt;

===Chevrolet Tracker===
In Russia and South America,&lt;ref name="Tracker-Colombia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracker-Argentina"/&gt; the Trax is instead named the '''Chevrolet Tracker''', which was the name used in [[North America|North]] and [[Latin America]] from 1989–1991 and 1999–2008 for a Chevrolet/Geo version of the [[Suzuki Sidekick]].&lt;ref name="trax_name"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Engines==
The Trax is offered in different markets with different choices of drivetrains. In Latin America the Trax is only available with the 1.8 liter gasoline engine. In Canada and the US, only the 1.4 liter turbocharged gasoline engine is offered. In Mexico and Australia (from 2015) it is available both in 1.8 liter and 1.4 liter turbocharged engines. European customers can choose between the 1.4 liter turbo gasoline engine, a 1.6 liter gasoline engine, and a 1.7 liter diesel engine.

==Production==
The Trax is being produced by both GM Korea and General Motors Mexico for most global markets. [[Shanghai GM]] will also be producing the model for the Chinese market from the 2015 model year onward. GM Uzbekistan will also be producing this model, starting from the end of 2018.

==Marketing==
The Trax is positioned below the [[compact car|compact]] [[Chevrolet Equinox]] and [[Chevrolet Captiva]] (depending on country) in the current Chevrolet line-up. In Europe, some dealers started branding it as a "compact SUV". However, in Canada, where the [[Chevrolet Orlando]] is positioned as "mid-size CUV" and the Equinox is the "compact CUV", the Trax is branded as "subcompact CUV" instead.

The '''Chevrolet Chevy Malibu''' was a [[compact car]] made by [[Chevrolet]] in Argentina from 1968 to 1982. Successor to the [[Chevrolet 400]], the Chevy Malibu offered a more modern body style with better safety features and updated mechanicals.

The car was based on the U.S. market 1968 Chevy II Nova.  Only the 4-door sedan version was manufactured in the country, although U.S. versions included a two door coupe in addition to the sedan.

==History==
Although the Chevy 400 sold well in the Argentine market, General Motors decided on offering an updated model with more modern styling and up-to-date mechanicals.  The Chevy 400 was based on the 1962 Chevy II, and by 1968, was already out of date.

While the equivalent U.S. Market Chevy Nova featured changes in safety and emissions equipment during its relatively short 1968-1974 run (it had a total restyle for 1975), the Argentina version retained the 1968 car's features throughout its entire run, including a dash-mounted ignition switch and smaller side marker lights.

The three models were :&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chevrolet.co.id/cars/spin/features-and-specs/models-specs.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211063151/http://www.chevrolet.co.id/cars/spin/features-and-specs/models-specs.html |archive-date=February 11, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1.2l Gasoline engine model came with 2 trims, LS and LT, available in 5 speed manual transmission only
* The 1.3l Turbocharged Diesel engine model also had 2 trims, LT and LTZ, also with manual transmission only
* The 1.5l Gasoline engine had more trims than others : 4 trims (LS, LT, LTZ and Activ) available in manual and 6 speed automatic transmission. 

The Indonesian version offered 7 seats and third row ventilation in all models.

On April 2014, General Motors Indonesia introduced a new trim in the 1.5l model, called Activ, only available with automatic transmission. Based on the LTZ trim, the Activ added new design elements like a larger front bumper with skid guards, 16-inch alloy wheels, roof rails, black plastic cladding for the lower part of the front and rear bumpers with silver skid plates, silver inserts for the side lower body and reflectors on the rear bumper, with ‘Activ’ embossed on it.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianautosblog.com/2014/11/chevrolet-spin-activ-crossover-in-images-156783&lt;/ref&gt; The car received black body paneling, and smoked headlamps were also part of the package. Inside, The full black interior color theme, was fitted with dual airbags and the steering gained audio controls.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianautosblog.com/2014/04/chevrolet-spin-activ-128085&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
[[File:Silver chevrolet spin.JPG|thumb|left|Rear view]]
In Brazil, the Spin replaced the [[Chevrolet Meriva|Meriva]] as [[GM do Brasil]] phased out the [[badge engineering]] of Opels as Chevrolets and vice versa. While the original '''Meriva A''' was developed jointly by GM do Brasil and Opel, the second generation [[Opel Meriva#Meriva B (2010–present)|'''Meriva B''']] had been developed exclusively by Opel and marketed only as Opel and [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]].

The LTZ trim of the Spin offered seven seats, and could thus also replace in Brasil the [[Chevrolet Zafira|Zafira]], whose global successor was split between [[Opel Zafira#Zafira Tourer C (2011–present)|Zafira]] and [[Chevrolet Orlando|Orlando]], both being based on the [[GM Delta II platform|GM's global Delta II platform]].

The Brazilian market received the Activ trim in November 2014; the differences from the Indonesian Activ were an exposed spare wheel and 1.8-liter EconoFlex engine capable of 108 bhp and 171 Nm of torque.&lt;ref&gt;http://indianautosblog.com/2014/11/chevrolet-spin-activ-crossover-in-images-156783&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Series AD Universal ''' or '''Chevrolet Universal AD''' is a [[Chevrolet]] car which began sales in 1930. Available in a variety of body types including as a 2-door coupe, 4-door sedan and a delivery van.

==History==
[[File:1930 Chevrolet Wrecker.jpg|thumb|left|1930 Chevrolet Truck]]
The Series AD was launched as replacement for the 1929 Series AC models. Sales dropped by over 200,000 to 640,980 vehicles for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1930 Chevrolet Series AD Universal|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1930-chevrolet-series-ad-universal.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The AD retained the new "stovebolt" {{Convert|194|CID|L|1}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|six-cylinder engine]] from the Series AC, but with bigger intake valves and smaller exhaust valves, along with a new manifold, raised power from {{convert|46|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The suspension now included hydraulic shock absorbers and the fuel gauge was moved from the tank to the dash panel.

Looking very similar to the 1927 Series AA Capitol, the wheelbase of the Series AB was increased by four inches to {{convert|107|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The updated look was one of the first projects from GM's Art &amp; Colour studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1928 Chevrolet National Series AB|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1928-chevrolet-national-series-ab.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Series AB was powered by Chevrolet's old {{convert|171|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} four-cylinder engine, but with minor modifications to produce {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 2,200 rpm. Four-wheel braking was also now provided.

The '''Chevrolet Series AE Independence''' (or Chevrolet Independence) is an American vehicle manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] in 1931 to replace the 1930 [[Chevrolet Series AD Universal|Series AD Universal]]. Production slipped by about eight percent to 619,554 cars as the [[Great Depression]] continued, but as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s output plummeted by nearly two-thirds, Chevrolet reclaimed first place in the American car sales table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1931 Chevrolet Series AE Independence|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1931-chevrolet-series-ae-independence.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Specification==
[[File:1931 Chevrolet Truck.jpg|thumb|left|1931 Chevrolet Truck]]
The main change between the Series AE and the outgoing AD was two-inch increase to the wheelbase, which was now {{convert|109|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}. It remained powered by the "Stovebolt Six" {{convert|194|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|six-cylinder engine]], now producing {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The 2-door Cabriolet, of which just over 23,000 were produced, could reach a top speed of {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1931 Chevrolet Independence|url=http://www.lemaymuseum.org/vehicles.php?vid=532|work=LeMay Museum|accessdate=3 January 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415064242/http://www.lemaymuseum.org/vehicles.php?vid=532#|archive-date=2013-04-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Series BA Confederate''' (or '''Chevrolet Confederate''') is an American vehicle manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] in 1932 to replace the 1931 [[Chevrolet Series AE Independence|Series AE Independence]]. Production slipped significantly from over 600,000 cars to 313,395 as the [[Great Depression]] continued, but was still sufficient for Chevrolet to retain first place in the American car sales table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1932 Chevrolet Series BA Confederate|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1932-chevrolet-series-ba-confederate.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were also affected by cross-town rival Ford introducing the [[1932 Ford|Ford V8]] coupe and sedan.

== Specifications ==
[[File:1932 Chevrolet Confederate BA (33153386550).jpg|left|250px|thumb|Coupe]]
The Series BA carried over much from the Series AE and the main external differences were the sloping of the windshield and the removal of the external visor above. On either side of the hood the previous louvers were replaced by opening vents, finished in a distinctive chrome on DeLuxe models

It remained powered by the "Stovebolt Six" {{convert|194|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|six-cylinder engine]], but now upgraded with a downdraft carburetor and a higher compression ratio to produce {{convert|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. A three-speed synchro-mesh transmission was fitted and a "Free Wheeling" mode was standard, which permitted the car to coast when the driver's foot was lifted from the accelerator.

The electrical system was 6 Volt Negative ground, dual front (referred to as "Town and Country") horns and a passenger side Brake and Parking lights were options that could have been added on at either the dealership or factory.  Turn signal systems had not yet been implemented, the generator used a "Cut-out" relay which only used 1 wire for its generating system. Voltage regulators weren't implemented until 1935.

The '''Chevrolet Eagle''' (Series CA) is an American vehicle manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] in 1933 to replace the 1932 [[Chevrolet Series BA Confederate|Series BA Confederate]]. The Eagle was produced early in the 1933 production year.  When it was joined by the cheaper [[Chevrolet Mercury|Mercury]] later in 1933 the Eagle name was changed to Master to provide Chevrolet with a two-car range, and the first time in ten years they manufactured two models on different wheelbases.  The Mercury was also known as the Standard series. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1933 Chevrolet Eagle and Mercury|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1933-chevrolet-eagle-and-mercury.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Total the earlier Eagle and later Master combined sold 450,435 vehicles, an increase of nearly 140,000 the previous year's Series BA sales of 313,395, and ensured that Chevrolet was able to retain their number one spot in American car sales. The Eagle saw the end of two-seater cars from Chevrolet, and the new Town Sedan included an integral trunk.

There are several differences between the Eagle and Master.  The easiest to identify is the post between the front door [[wing window]]s and the roll down windows.  On the Eagle the chrome divider between these two windows goes down as the window goes down, where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go down with the window.

==Specification==
The Eagle and Master's wheelbase increased an inch to {{convert|110|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} compared to the Series BA, and was three inches longer than the new Mercury.

It was powered by a larger version of the "Stovebolt Six", {{convert|206|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|six-cylinder engine]], producing {{convert|65|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1933 Chevrolet Master Eagle Series CA Cabriolet|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20582/lot/339/|work=Bonhams|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A smaller {{convert|181|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} six-cylinder was used in the Mercury, producing {{convert|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}

GM also used the Eagle chassis and platform for trucks branded as both Chevrolet and GMC.

The '''Chevrolet Standard''' (Series DC) was launched in 1933, initially as the '''Chevrolet Mercury''', by [[Chevrolet]] as a lower priced alternative to the 1932 [[Chevrolet Series BA Confederate]] that became the [[Chevrolet Eagle|Eagle]] in 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1933 Chevrolet Eagle and Mercury|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1933-chevrolet-eagle-and-mercury.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Chevrolet Master|Master]] from 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1933-Chevrolet.pdf |title=GM Heritage Center 1933 information sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015145329/http://gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1933-Chevrolet.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was advertised as the cheapest six-cylinder enclosed car on the market.&lt;ref&gt;The Tuscaloosa News - Mar 12, 1933 pg11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standard was offered in three body styles all on a 107-inch wheelbase: [[Coach (carriage)|coach]], [[coupe]] and coupe with [[rumble seat]]. All bodies were by [[Fisher Body|Fisher]] and featured 'no-draft ventilation'. All models were powered by a {{convert|181|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] valve-in-head engine producing {{convert|60|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3,000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|125|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1935-Chevrolet.pdf |title=GM Heritage Center 1935 information sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015115241/http://gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1935-Chevrolet.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the car a top speed of between 65–70&amp;nbsp;mph.

In 1935, a larger {{convert|206.8|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine was offered in lieu of the {{convert|181|cuin|cc|abbr=on}}, producing {{convert|74|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|150|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A sedan delivery was also available this year.

For 1936, the Standard Six received a wide range of improvements and a wider choice of body styles including [[cabriolet]] and [[sports sedan]] versions. It was built on a new box-girder frame with a wheel base of 109 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1936-Chevrolet.pdf |title=GM Heritage Center 1936 information sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015143707/http://gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1936-Chevrolet.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With an increase of compression ratio from 5.6:1 to 6:1, the standard {{convert|206.8|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} engine now produced {{convert|79|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3,200&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|156|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque which was now shared with the Master Six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1936-chevrolet-standard-and-master-deluxe.htm |title=How Stuff Works |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spare wheel moved from its external rear trunk location to a new compartment under the trunk. Brakes were 11-in drums.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1936"/&gt; The steel roof was new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1936_Chevrolet/1936_Chevrolet_Brochure/1936%20Chevrolet-14c.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1936_Chevrolet/1936_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standard Six was discontinued for 1937 when the Master range was joined by the new Master Deluxe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1937-1939-chevrolet1.htm |title=How Stuff Works |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Master''' and Master Deluxe are American passenger vehicles manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] between 1933 and 1942 to replace the 1933 [[Chevrolet Eagle|Eagle]]. It was the more expensive model in the Chevrolet range at this time, with the [[Chevrolet Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Chevrolet Standard Six|Standard]] providing a cheaper and smaller range between 1933 and 1937. From 1940 a more expensive version based on the Master Deluxe was launched called the '''Special Deluxe'''.

==Model years==
The Master name was used on a number of different versions, and the Series name changed each year.

===1933 (Series CA)===
The Series CA Master replaced the 1933 [[Chevrolet Eagle|Eagle]] midway through the model year when the 1933 Standard model (Series CC) was introduced.  Several changes were made to the Eagle when the name was changed to Master.  The easiest to identify is the post between the front door wing windows and the roll down windows.  On the Eagle the chrome divider between these two windows goes down as the window goes down, where as on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go down with the window.

===1934 (Series DA)===
[[File:1934 Chevrolet Master Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1934 Master Sedan]]
The Series DA Master replaced the 1933 [[Chevrolet Eagle|Eagle]], with an increased wheelbase of {{convert|112|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}. This increased the difference with the cheaper Standard wheelbase to {{convert|5|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}. Powered by an upgraded version of the "Stovebolt Six", {{convert|206|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|six-cylinder engine]], now producing {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

===1935 (Series EA and ED)===
The Master underwent a redesign, utilising a new "Turret Top" construction method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet, 1912-2003: 90 Years of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IkU1UjnG6QC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=chevrolet+series+ca+eagle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFqsVIT4JX&amp;sig=AeWn93cBwZrL7NUt2BhtV166KC8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sxPmULHgJenO0QWHnoD4BA&amp;ved=0CG0Q6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=chevrolet%20series%20ca%20eagle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1937 (Series GA and GB)===

[[File:Witold Rychter Polska 06 1937.jpg|thumb|right|A license-built Chevrolet Master Sedan from factory in Poland (1936-1939)]]

The Master now replaced the lower priced [[Chevrolet Standard Six|Standard Six]], while the more luxurious new '''Master Deluxe''' edged the range upwards. The bodies were shared with the [[Pontiac#1926–1942|Pontiac Deluxe]].

===1938 (series HA and HB)===
The Master (HB) and Master Deluxe (HA) sold well, with 162,430 and 302,728 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1938 Chevrolet Master and Master DeLuxe|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1938-chevrolet-master-and-master-deluxe.htm|work=How Stuff Works|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939 (series JA and JB)===
[[File:1939 Chevrolet Master Town Sedan, rear.jpg|thumb|left|1939 Master Deluxe Town Sedan]]
The Master returned for 1939. The Master Deluxe was now the JA, while the base model was renamed the '''Master 85''' (JB). A station wagon was offered, though its construction had been contracted to Mid States Body Corp.&lt;ref&gt;Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939, The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940 (series KA and KB)===
The Master continued to be available in Master 85 (KB) as well as the more upscale "Master Deluxe" model (KA). The even better equipped "Special Deluxe" also appeared for the 1940 model year.

==Trucks and buses==
This was the last series of trucks and medium-duty vehicles that shared an appearance with Chevrolet passenger coupes and sedans, and were replaced with the [[Chevrolet AK Series|AK Series]] trucks.

The '''Chevrolet Series FB''' (or Chevrolet FB) is an American vehicle manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] from 1919 to 1922. It was a slightly larger replacement to the 1918 [[Chevrolet Series FA]], sitting on a wheelbase of {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. It was replaced by the 1923 [[Chevrolet Superior]].

The FB was the largest model in the Chevrolet range at the time following the demise of the V8 [[Chevrolet Series D|Series D]], and complemented the smaller [[Chevrolet Series 490]].

==Model names==
The Series FB was advertised as the FB-12 and FB-20 (roadster), FB-22 and FB-30 (coupe), FB-40 and FB-42 (sedan) and FB-32 and FB-50 (touring).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevrolet Data Sheets 1921|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet/1921_Chevrolet_Data_Sheets/1921%20Chevrolet-03.html|work=The Old Car Manual Project|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1920 Chevrolet|url=http://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/Chevrolet/1920-Chevrolet.pdf|work=GM Heritage Center|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The roadster was also sometimes known as the "Royal Mail" and the tourer as the "Baby Grand", but these names were officially dropped during 1919.&lt;ref name=Hemmings&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevrolet's Classic|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2005/08/01/hmn_feature12.html|work=Hemmings|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During 1922 the model was sometimes referred to as the "Superior", which is the name given to the 1923 replacement.

==Specification==
Available in four body styles; two-door roadster and coupe and four-door tourer and sedan. The FB continued in production without many changes, the most significant in 1922 with a change to steel wheels in lieu of wood spoke ones, and larger 10gal fuel tank.

All model years were powered by the same {{convert|224|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} 4-cylinder overhead valve engine, producing {{convert|37|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 2000rpm, as used in the previous Series FA; this had been developed from the short-stroke {{convert|171|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} version with {{convert|24|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} used in the [[Chevrolet Series H|Series H]] before it.&lt;ref name=Hemmings/&gt;

==Australia production==
The Chevrolet Stylemaster was also produced by [[General Motors-Holden's]] in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=Darwin100/&gt; As Holden had carried over the body tooling from its 1942 models, the Australian sedan differed from its US counterpart in having a different body with rear-hinged back doors and a larger trunk.&lt;ref name=Darwin1917&gt;Norm Darwin, The History of Holden in Australia since 1917,  page 62&lt;/ref&gt; The grilles fitted to the Australian models were the same as those used on the US models.&lt;ref&gt;The Post-war Chevrolet, 1946-1948, Restored Cars No 156, Jan-Feb 2003, pages 20 to 23&lt;/ref&gt; Australian production included a [[coupe utility]], which was, like the sedan, produced in 1946, 1947 and 1948 models.&lt;ref name=Darwin100/&gt;

It was a replacement of the [[Chevrolet Series F|Series F]] (the successor of the [[Chevrolet Series H|Series H]]) which had improvements in engine capacity as well as other features. In this transformation of series, the pre-existing names of the H and F series cars, The Royal Mail and Baby Grand were dropped in favor of the names Roadster and Touring respectively. The FA Series was then replaced by the [[Chevrolet Series FB]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="a2" &gt;{{cite book  | last1 = R. Kimes | first1 = Beverly  | last2 = C.

==Technical Improvements==
The FA was mounted on the same [[chassis]] as the Series H and F and had the same [[wheelbase]] of 108&amp;nbsp;inches as the Series F, using the [[GM A platform]]. The FA had an improved version of the engines of its preceding two series. The stroke of the earlier four-cylinder engine was lengthened by 11/4&amp;nbsp;inches thereby enlarging displacement to 224&amp;nbsp;cubic inches and boosting horsepower to 37 for the FA. This new engine possessed a circulating oil pump and a water pump that replaced the [[thermosiphon]] cooling system. In addition, the gearbox was repositioned against the clutch to form a unit with the engine.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

*Inline
*Four-cylinder cast-iron block
*Bore and stroke: 3 11/16 × 5 1/4 in

==Models==

===The Chevrolet FA Sedan===
The Chevrolet FA sedan called FA-4,  The Roadster FA-2 "Royal Mail", and an open Touring, FA-5 "Baby Grand", The 1917 car was larger than the [[Chevrolet Series 490]]. It had an easy access via the single right-hand door even without a folding forward right front seat. The flat floor of the car was a double step down to the ground. It was made of wood and had removable pillars for the roof of the car.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

=== The FA Series Touring Opera Sedan===
All weather sedans had been transformed into pillar-less "hardtop" sedans that were similar to the body styles Chevrolet and General Motors makes introduced between 1949 and 1956. This closed or "all season" model offered by Chevrolet in 1917–1918, the $1,475 FA series Touring Opera Car was identical to the sedan except that the pillars for the roof of the car were attached.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

===The New FA Sedan With An Openable Windshield===
The closed cars that [[Chevrolet]] had started offering lacked the fresh-air ventilation of topless roadsters and touring cars. As a response to this problem Chevrolet the new FA Series sedan in 1917–1918 that had an openable, horizontally split windshield. It was in a way the predecessor of artificial air conditioning that was introduced as an option 40&amp;nbsp;years later and is considered standard today.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

===Models===
The first generation Onix was available in three trim levels (LS, LT and LTZ) with two [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]] engines, the 1.0-liter producing {{convert|78|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} (gasoline)/{{convert|80|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} (ethanol) and 1.4-liter {{convert|98|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} (gasoline)/{{convert|106|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} (ethanol) offering [[automatic transmission|automatic]] or five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] transmission.  In Brazil the 4-door sedan variant was known as the '''Chevrolet Prisma'''.

For 2017, the Onix and Prisma received a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]], along with interior improvements.&lt;ref&gt;http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/07/2017-chevrolet-onix-ushers-in-more-green-and-technology-traits/&lt;/ref&gt;  A touchscreen was added with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support.  The LS trim level kept the original front end and became known as the '''Onix Joy''' and '''Prisma Joy''', leaving the LT as the base trim for the updated Onix/Prisma.  A crossover-like version called the '''Onix Activ''' was also added, with raised suspension, plastic body cladding, and roof rack.

In late 2019, the Onix and Prisma were replaced in Brazil by the second-generation Onix and Onix Plus, respectively.  However, the Onix Joy and Prisma Joy remained available, and were renamed '''Joy''' and '''Joy Plus''', respectively.

===Technical details===
Specs include front-wheel drive, [[MacPherson strut]] front and [[twist-beam rear suspension]], and (in the three versions shown) dual air bag, ABS and power steering. In February 2013, the new Prisma, the sedan version of the Onix, with a trunk of 500 liters, was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOVO PRISMA 2013/ONIX SEDAN, PREÇO, FOTOS E FICHA TÉCNICA | url=http://www.magazinecarros.com/2013/02/novoprisma2013.html | work=Magazine Carros | accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1.0 versions are fitted with 14" wheels, with 15" fitted to the 1.4 models.

===Safety===
In December 2014, the Chevrolet Onix was evaluated under the [[Latin NCAP]] assessment and achieved a 3-star safety rating for adults and 2-star safety rating for children:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.latinncap.com/data/pdf/chevrolet_onix_2airbag_update_po_.pdf|title = Latin NCAP Assessment Chevrolet Onix|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, a new sedan named the Onix was launched in China, different from both the Onix and Prisma from Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/03/this-is-the-all-new-2019-chevrolet-onix-sedan/&lt;/ref&gt; The Onix replaces both the [[Chevrolet Sonic|Sonic]] and [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]] in the Chinese market, and is slightly larger than the Prisma/Onix sedan.  It uses the GEM (Global Emerging Markets) platform.  

The Onix is offered in China with a turbocharged, direct-injected 1.0-liter 3-cylinder engine, rated at {{convert|92|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque. Fuel economy is rated at {{convert|4.9|L/100 km|mpgus|abbr=on}}.  A naturally aspirated 1.0 L 3-cylinder engine is due to follow. Brazilian versions resort to port-injection for both the turbocharged and the naturally aspirated versions.
===Chevrolet Onix Redline===
[[File:Chevrolet Onix 007.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Onix Redline rear]]
The first version of the Onix to debut was the Onix Redline.  It features black exterior trim with red accents, and a two-tone interior.&lt;ref&gt;http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/all-new-chevrolet-onix-redline-launches-in-china/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazilian market===
[[File:Chevrolet Onix II front Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Onix front]]
[[File:Chevrolet Onix II rear Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Onix hatchback rear]]
In Brazil, the new sedan debuted in September 2019 as the Onix Plus, while the hatchback went on sale in November 2019. &lt;ref&gt;http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/09/gm-introduces-all-new-chevrolet-onix-in-south-america/&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the LT and LTZ trim levels from the previous generation, a new top-level Premier level was added.  The Onix Plus was rated 5 stars by Latin NCAP.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motorpasion.com.mx/industria/chery-tiggo-3-reprueba-chevrolet-new-onix-obtiene-5-estrellas-pruebas-latin-ncap&lt;/ref&gt;

All versions of new Onix and Onix Plus have 6 airbags, ABS brakes and electric stability control.

In 2019, the Chevrolet Onix was the best-selling car model in Brazil, for the fifth consecutive year, with a total of 268,066 sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/01/chevrolet-onix-sets-new-sales-record-in-brazil/&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the best-selling model in Latin America.

===Mexican market===
The Onix will be launched in the Mexican market in spring of 2020 as well to place itself between the [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]] and the [[Chevrolet Sail|Sail]], the latter being known as Aveo in that country.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motorpasion.com.mx/industria/chevrolet-onix-2020-primeros-detalles-mexico&lt;/ref&gt;

Two new motors were announced for the Onix by GM of Mexico for the Mexican market prior to its March 2020 launch. LT and LS trim lines will use a 1.0-litre motor able to generate 85 kW (114 hp) and 120 lb-ft, with an option of a 5-gear manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission. Its top trim line, Premier, will use a 1.2-litre motor able to generate 96 kW (130 hp) and 141 lb-ft, only offered with a 6-speed automatic transmission. All motors are turbo-powered. All versions will have 6 airbags, ABS brakes and electric stability control. In addition, other things are included, such as a 7" (17cm) infotainment system screen, OnStar services, reverse sensor with camera, leather interior skin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motorpasion.com.mx/industria/chevrolet-onix-confirma-dos-motores-para-mexico-ambos-turbo&lt;/ref&gt;

== First series ==
The first series [[Chevrolet]] Constantia went on sale in May 1969, along with the lower priced [[Holden HK#South Africa|Kommando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor-last=Emslie |editor-first=Robin |date=September 1969 |title=Trends |magazine=Motoring Mirror |location=Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Motorpress |volume=7 |number=5 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the Australian [[Holden Brougham]] four-door sedan, but featured a unique frontal treatment. The styling changes were undertaken in [[General Motors]]' [[Port Elizabeth]] studios in South Africa &lt;ref name=OutOfAfrica&gt;Out of Africa, Australian Muscle Car,  Issue 33, pages 82-87&lt;/ref&gt; and the model was locally produced.&lt;ref name= Observers&gt;Chevrolet Constantia, The Observers Book of Automobiles, Sixteen Edition, 1970, page 40&lt;/ref&gt; The Constantia was offered with a 4.1 litre six and a 5.0 litre V8.&lt;ref name=moby302&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230215613/http://moby302.co.za/general_motors/chevrolet.html General Motors - Chevrolet in South Africa 1962 - 1979 Timeline, moby302.co.za, as archived at web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 843 were sold in 1969 followed by 750 in 1970 and 800 in 1971.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=Douglas |date=January–February 2006 |title=1970 Holden HT Brougham |journal=Restored Cars | location = Newstead, Victoria, Australia | number = 174 |pages=26-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AQ series ==
The AQ series Constantia was introduced in 1972 and was based on another Australian design, the [[Statesman HQ]].&lt;ref name=RestoredCars191&gt;{{cite journal | title = When is a Holden not a Holden? | location = Newstead, Victoria, Australia | journal = Restored Cars | number = 191 | date = November–December 2008 | pages = 32-35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, frontal styling was different from the Australian model, this time featuring a unique grille based on the 1970 Chevrolet Malibu.&lt;ref name=OutOfAfrica/&gt; The restyling work was a joint effort undertaken in Australia.&lt;ref name=OutOfAfrica/&gt; The AQ Series Constantia was offered with a 4.1-litre six and a 5.0-litre V8.&lt;ref name=moby302/&gt;  Wheel covers came from the 1971-72 North American Chevelle Malibu.

== AJ series ==
The revised AJ series Constantia was marketed in South Africa from 1975 to 1978.&lt;ref name=RestoredCars191/&gt; It was offered as a four-door sedan, based on the [[Statesman HJ]]&lt;ref name=RestoredCars191/&gt; and as a five-door wagon, &lt;ref name=RestoredCars191/&gt; based on the [[Holden HJ]] wagon. The AJ Series was offered with a 4.1-litre six and a 5.0-litre V8.&lt;ref name=moby302/&gt; A more luxurious version was sold as the [[Chevrolet Caprice#South Africa|Chevrolet Caprice Classic]].

The '''Chevrolet Spark''' is a [[city car]], originally marketed prominently as the '''Daewoo Matiz'''. It has been available solely as a five-door hatchback.

The first generation of Daewoo Matiz was launched in 1998 by General Motors' South Korean division [[GM Korea]], previously known as Daewoo Motors, replacing the [[Daewoo Tico]]. After the General Motors company took control over Daewoo Motors in 2002, it has increasingly been marketed under the Chevrolet badge. The second generation model was introduced in 2005, with the third generation launched in 2010.

A limited-production [[all-electric car|all-electric version]], the '''Chevrolet Spark EV''', was released in the U.S. in selected markets in California and Oregon in June 2013. The Spark EV was the first all-electric passenger car marketed by General Motors since the [[General Motors EV1|EV1]] was discontinued in 1999.&lt;ref name=NYT101211/&gt;&lt;ref name=EVreleased/&gt;

[[File:Daewoo Matiz 20090815 rear.JPG|thumb|left|Daewoo Matiz (M100; pre-facelift)]]
[[File:Daewoo Matiz M100 - deska rozdzielcza.JPG|thumb|left|Interior (M100; pre-facelift)]]
The production of Daewoo Matiz started in 1998 and it was sold in South Korea and many European markets with the code name ''M100''. The exterior design is based on the Lucciola, a 1993 [[Fiat Cinquecento]] concept by [[Italdesign Giugiaro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/aprile/21/Daewoo_Matiz_ambizioni_mondiali_con_co_0_980421561.shtml |title=Daewoo Matiz: ambizioni mondiali con design italiano e cuore asiatico |work=Corriere della Sera |date=April 21, 1998 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been rejected by [[Fiat]]. The 0.8-litre gasoline engine and the transmission were carryovers from the [[Daewoo Tico]], but it was now using a [[fuel injection|multipoint injection]] fuel system.&lt;ref name="autotypes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Daewoo Matiz specifications |url=http://www.auto-types.com/daewoo/ |publisher=Auto Types |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering was carried out at Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in England. The car became the best selling Daewoo model in Europe and in India for the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best Selling Cars – Matt's blog " Europe |url=http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/category/europe/ |publisher=Best Selling Cars |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed on the basis of the [[Daewoo Tico]], version under license of the [[Suzuki Alto]], with which both Tico and Matiz share mechanics and suspensions. From this origin derives its characteristic narrow width, imposed by the Japanese "[[Kei car]]" tax category, which exempts from the need to certificate that an adequate [[parking]] is available for the vehicle.

The Matiz was originally launched with just a 0.8-litre [[straight-three engine]]. It developed a maximum power of {{convert|51|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a maximum torque of {{convert|68.5|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} and had a combined consumption of {{convert|6.4|l/100 km|mpgimp|abbr=on}}. It had a top speed of {{convert|144|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and could reach from 0 to {{convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 17 seconds.&lt;ref name="autotypes"/&gt; This engine was developed from the Tico unit by [[Tickford]], a UK company based in Milton Keynes. The [[Tickford]] connection was acknowledged in the brochures distributed in UK showrooms.

It was released mainly with three trim levels: E, S and SE. The latter had air conditioning, wheel covers, body-colored bumpers, rear spoiler, fog lights and a stereo, with optional features such as roof rails, power steering, central locking, electric front windows, ABS and driver airbag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daewoo Matiz – caracteristici tehnice |url=http://www.daewooauto.ro/modele/matiz/tehnic.php |publisher=Daewoo Automobile România |accessdate=September 8, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031126201048/http://www.daewooauto.ro/modele/matiz/tehnic.php |archivedate=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain markets it was also available with an automatic transmission.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This facelift was designed at Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in England and introduced in South Korea in late 2000, and exported from 2001. The front-end structure was modified to accommodate a [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] engine, although the introduction of this engine, the 1.0-litre [[Daewoo S-Tec engine|S-Tec unit]], was delayed until after Daewoo's takeover by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in 2002.

M150 is still produced by GM-Uzbekistan (previously [[UzDaewooAuto]]) in Uzbekistan. The car was launched to the Russian market as the ''Ravon Matiz'' in 2016 but discontinued soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wroom.ru/en/cars/ravon/matiz |title=Ravon Matiz |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Wroom.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea and Japan this updated Matiz was sold under the name ''Daewoo Matiz II''.

=== Lechi ===
In China the car was sold as the Chevrolet Lechi. It remained in production until 2012, when an updated version was introduced as the [[Baojun]] Lechi. It is to be offered under both Chevrolet and Baojun brands during a transition period.&lt;ref name=BaoChi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/cn/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/cn/en/2012/Aug/0815_Lechi.html |title=Chevrolet Lechi to Be Sold Under Baojun Brand in China |date=August 15, 2012 |type=News release |work=GM Media: China |publisher=General Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lechi has also received certain powertrain updates, making the car economical enough to qualify for a subsidy and a tax break from the Chinese government.&lt;ref name=BaoChi/&gt;

=== Copying controversy ===
The [[Chery QQ3]], then known as the [[Chery QQ3|Chery QQ]], became the center of an industrial copyright and intellectual rights controversy, as [[General Motors]] claimed the car was a copy of the [[Daewoo Matiz]]. GM executives demonstrated the extent of the design duplication, noting for example that the doors of the QQ and those of the Spark are interchangeable&lt;ref name="chdaily"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/editorials/china-to-foreign-automakers-drop-dead/ |title=China to Foreign Automakers: Drop Dead |work=Frank Williams |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; without modification.

GM China Group indicated the two vehicles "shared remarkably identical body structure, exterior design, interior design and key components"&lt;ref name="chdaily"/&gt; MotorAuthority.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/industry/chinese-chery-qq-a-carbon-copy-of-the-daewoo-matiz/ |title=China Chinese Chery QQ – a carbon copy of the Daewoo Matiz |publisher=MotorAuthority.com |date=July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Car and Driver]]'' called the QQ a "[[carbon copy]]", while the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', in a 2005 article, referred to it as a clone.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/01/06/business/cars.php |title=China's quest to sell cars in the U.S. |work=International Herald Tribune |first=Chris |last=Buckley |date=January 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Detroit News]]'' reported that "the dispute reflects the confusion, risks and ambitions in China's new auto industry, where global carmakers are battling pugnacious upstarts for a piece of what may become the world's largest auto market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0501/02/A08-47232.htm |title=Chinese carmaker ambitious, controversial |publisher=Detroit News, Christine Tierney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In 2005 the Matiz received substantial modifications (''M200''), previewed by the '''Chevrolet M3X''' concept car shown at 2004 [[Paris Motor Show]]. The upper body was significantly revised based again on a design from [[Italdesign Giugiaro]], the S-Tec engines were updated and the car's [[drag coefficient]] was lowered, resulting in better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. The interior was also significantly revised, one notable feature of this car being its centre-mounted instrument cluster. The platform was also revised, with a twist-beam rear suspension system replacing the previous 3-link beam axle, and the front suspension making use of cast, rather than pressed and fabricated, lower control arms.

In 2008, the 800cc engine was revised to fall below the 120g/km level, thus qualifying for the UK's £35 road tax band and no [[London congestion charge]].

In Europe it was sold under the names '''Chevrolet Matiz''' and '''Chevrolet Spark'''. In Italy there was an [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] version called ''Chevrolet Matiz Eco Logic''. The Matiz Eco Logic was built from 2007 to 2010 in over 60,000 vehicles by BRC Gas Equipment in [[Cherasco]], [[Cuneo]] (Italy).

In South Korea, where it was sold only with an 800 cc engine and following the introduction of M300 Matiz (''Matiz Creative''), the M200 Matiz was renamed to ''Matiz Classic''.

It was sold in over 2.3 million units worldwide during the first 10 years of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://car-action.blogspot.com/2008/05/gm-daewoo-matiz-will-continue-to-win.html |title=10 years of Daewoo Matiz |publisher=Car-action.blogspot.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930172148/http://car-action.blogspot.com/2008/05/gm-daewoo-matiz-will-continue-to-win.html |archivedate=September 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, [[VIDAMCO]] of Vietnam produces the Matiz M200 as the ''Chevrolet Spark Lite'' in [[knock-down kit|complete knock-down]] (CKD) form at its [[Hanoi]] production facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellison |first=Edd |date=November 15, 2010 |url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/vietnam_auto_industry_101115/ |title=Vietnam Gearing Up for Rapid Auto Industry Growth |work=[[Ward's|Ward's Auto]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/611kEqiqD?url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/vietnam_auto_industry_101115/ |archivedate=August 18, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the local manufacturer [[General Motors India|GM India]] produced two special editions of this generation: the Chevrolet Spark LPG, a version equipped with a sequential injection-type [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] kit, unveiled on the World Environment Day in New Delhi, and the Chevrolet Spark Muzic, introduced in 2009.

The redesigned Matiz (codenamed ''M300'') was launched in 2009 and is based on the 2007 Chevrolet Beat concept car. Although sold globally as the Chevrolet Spark, in India this model retains the Beat name from the concept car, as the second generation Spark continues to be sold in this market. Prior to the 2011 elimination of the Daewoo marque in South Korea, the third generation Spark was marketed as the '''Daewoo Matiz Creative'''. This marque was less successful than the previous models.&lt;ref name="theautochannel"/&gt;

=== Concept ===
[[File:Chevrolet Beat concept front.jpg|left|thumb|Chevrolet Beat concept]]
The '''Chevrolet Beat''' was unveiled at the [[New York International Auto Show#2007|2007 New York International Auto Show]] alongside two other concept vehicles, the [[Chevrolet Trax (concept car)|Trax]] and the [[Chevrolet Groove|Groove]]. The Beat is a front drive, three-door [[hatchback]] concept, derived from the [[Daewoo Kalos]]. It was built in India, and designed by [[GM Daewoo]] in South Korea. It is powered by a 1.2&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged gasoline engine mated to an [[automatic transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/chevrolet-Spark-trax-groove-concept.html |title=Chevrolet Beat, Groove, Trax concepts debut |date=April 4, 2007 |publisher=Leftlane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version was featured in the Michael Bay movie ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' as [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] alongside the GM Trax mini-SUV. The Beat concept sports a Vertigo Green exterior paint job with the same hue carried over to parts of the interior. Its profile is high at the rear and tapering down evenly to the front of the grille. Headlights that appear to extend all the way from the base of the grille to the base of the windshield are [[LED]]-type. Oversize 17&amp;nbsp;inch wheels barely hide the matching green paint of disc brakes. Twin taillights that extend upward to the back-up lights are also LEDs.

In early 2007, GM conducted a poll testing the relative popularity of the Beat, Trax and Groove concepts on a Chevrolet website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=120269 |title=Chevrolet Rolls Out Beat, Groove and Trax Minicar Concepts |date=April 4, 2007 |publisher=Edmunds}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Beat receiving nearly 50% of the vote, which ultimately determined the car making it into production.

GM displayed a prototype woodie version of the forthcoming Chevrolet Spark for the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]].&lt;ref name="aveowood"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cowabunga, Europe: The Chevy Spark Woodie Wagon |publisher=[[Jalopnik]], Matt Hardigree, August 5, 2010 |url=http://jalopnik.com/5605265/cowabunga-europe-the-chevy-spark-woodie-wagon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM presented a pre-production version of the Chevrolet Beat carrying the '''Chevrolet Spark''' nameplate at the [[North American International Auto Show#2009|2009 North American International Auto Show]]. The production version was announced at the 2009 North American International Auto Show, but only the Beat concept was shown at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Filipponio |first=Frank |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/11/detroit-2009-chevy-spark-playing-to-a-familiar-beat-w-video/ |title=Detroit 2009: Chevy Spark playing to a familiar Beat |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=January 13, 2009 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production Chevrolet Spark was unveiled at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2009|2009 Geneva Motor Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nunez |first=Alex |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/02/10/geneva-preview-chevy-spark-finally-makes-its-debut/ |title=Geneva Preview: 2010 Chevy Spark finally, fully revealed |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=February 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became available in Europe in the first quarter of 2010, followed by other markets worldwide, with US sales set to begin in early 2012. Commercial production of a 5-door Chevrolet Beat started from December 15, 2009, in Halol, Gujarat, India. It was launched in India on January 5, 2010, during Auto Expo New Delhi, India.

The GM Daewoo Matiz version was unveiled in the 2009 Seoul Motor Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/seoul-motor-show-2009-photo-spread-i |title=Seoul Motor Show 2009 Photo Spread I |publisher=Koreaittimes.com |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420132257/http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/seoul-motor-show-2009-photo-spread-i |archive-date=April 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holden version, named Barina Spark, was revealed at the 2010 [[Australian International Motor Show]] in Sydney in October. It was discontinued in February 2018.

With M300, the original Suzuki platform was replaced by [[GM Gamma platform|GM Global Small Vehicles platform]], developed by [[GM Daewoo]] engineers.

In North America, the Spark was first delivered to GM dealerships in Mexico for the 2012 model year, but did not replace the Chevrolet Matiz (formerly Pontiac G2 Matiz), which was sold until 2014. The United States version of the 2013 Chevrolet Spark went into production on April 16, 2012, and arrived in dealerships in August 2012. For 2014 in North America, the automatic transmission is a Jatco M4M-CVT7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jatco CVT7 |url=http://www.jatco.co.jp/ENGLISH/products/cvt/cvt7.html |publisher=jatco.co.jp |accessdate=October 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030193659/http://www.jatco.co.jp/ENGLISH/products/cvt/cvt7.html |archive-date=October 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and the final drive ratio lowered to 3.75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 CHEVROLET SPARK SPECIFICATIONS |url=https://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/spark/2014.tab1.html |publisher=gm.com |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 CHEVROLET SPARK SPECIFICATIONS |url=http://media.gm.ca/content/media/ca/en/chevrolet/vehicles/spark/2014.tab1.html |publisher=gm.ca |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CVT gives better fuel mileage overall than the previous 4 speed automatic, and changing the final drive ratio from its previous 4.145&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 CHEVROLET SPARK SPECIFICATIONS |url=https://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/spark/2013.tab1.html |publisher=gm.com |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Chevrolet Spark SPECIFICATIONS |url=http://media.gm.ca/content/media/ca/en/chevrolet/vehicles/spark/2013.tab1.html |publisher=gm.ca |accessdate=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduces engine noise and increases fuel economy on the highway while increasing noise and reducing fuel mileage in the city.

=== Beat sedan ===
A four-door sedan version was unveiled at the 2016 [[Auto Expo]] in India as the Chevrolet Essentia. After GM stopped selling cars in India in 2017, the Essentia was cancelled for the Indian market. As the result, the model was instead exported to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibtimes.co.in/gm-ships-beat-sedan-essentia-meant-india-latin-america-732288 GM ships Beat sedan (Essentia) meant for India to Latin America] - Ken Sunny, International Business Times, 26 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, it is sold as the Beat NB (Notchback).

The '''Spark EV''' was a limited production 5-door hatchback [[battery electric vehicle]] produced by Chevrolet in 2013–2016.

In October 2011, General Motors announced the planned production of the '''Chevrolet Spark EV''', an [[electric car|all-electric]] version of the third-generation Chevrolet Spark, with availability limited to select markets. The production version was unveiled at the November 2012 [[Los Angeles Auto Show#2012|Los Angeles Auto Show]].&lt;ref name=NYT112812&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/2014-chevrolet-spark-ev-worth-the-extra-charge/?ref=automobiles |title=2014 Chevrolet Spark EV: Worth the Extra Charge? |author=Jerry Garrett |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, the fourth-generation Spark (the second generation of Spark to be sold in the North American market) is available in three trim levels: the base '''1LS''', the midrange '''1LT''', and the top-of-the-line '''2LT'''.  In North America, the Spark is powered by a 1.4&amp;nbsp;L, {{convert|1399|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} ''[[GM Small Gasoline Engine#LV7|LV7]]'' [[DOHC]] [[inline-four engine|I4]] (gasoline) producing {{convert|98|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|94|lbft|Nm|0}} torque.  The Korean domestic version uses a 1.0&amp;nbsp;L engine.  

The Spark features a Chevrolet MyLink 7-inch diagonal touch-screen infotainment system with radio, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto,  Bluetooth hands-free calling, and voice command via smartphone.  The higher-end models add features like leatherette-trimmed seats, keyless entry, power windows and door locks, 16-inch alloy wheels, and fog lamps.

=== Facelift ===
In 2018, for the 2019 model year, the Spark received a mid-cycle facelift, along with the [[Chevrolet Camaro]], [[Chevrolet Cruze]] and [[Chevrolet Malibu]]. Changes for the Spark include a new third-generation [[MyLink]] infotainment system, revised exterior styling cues, the addition of low-speed autonomous emergency braking (AEB) on selected models, and new exterior color options. In the United States, the facelifted Spark went on sale in the third quarter of 2018 as an early 2019 [[model year]] vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/spark/2019.html |title=2019 Chevrolet Spark |publisher=GM |location=US |access-date=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global marketing and manufacture ==
=== Asia ===
In India, it was launched in 1999 as the Daewoo Matiz. In 2007, General Motors India launched the Chevrolet M3X concept based third generation, as the Chevrolet Spark. In Japan, the Matiz was sold under the GM Daewoo brand through the [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]] dealership network, but was considered a "compact car" due to the length, width and engine displacement exceeding the [[Kei car#History of regulations|Kei car regulations]]. In the [[Philippines]], the Matiz was available during the years 1999–2000 through the grey market. In 2007, it was released under the name '''Chevrolet Spark'''. In [[Pakistan]], the car was initially introduced as '''Chevrolet Exclusive''' in 2003. From 2005–2009 it was manufactured by Nexus Automotive under the name '''Chevrolet Joy''', which has now been replaced by the newer M200 series and is currently sold as the '''Chevrolet Spark'''. In [[Taiwan]], the Matiz was sold under the [[Formosa Automobile|Formosa]] brand between 2001 and 2009.

=== Europe ===
From 1998 until 2004, the Matiz was sold in Europe under the Daewoo badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/reviews/daewoo/matiz/hatchback-1998/ |title=Daewoo Matiz (98-05) – Review |publisher=Parkers |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, it took the Chevrolet marque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/carbycar/chevrolet/matiz-2005/ |title=Chevrolet Matiz (2005–2010) |publisher=Honest John |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the other South Korean models of General Motors, such as the Lacetti and Kalos. Since 2000, [[Complete knock down|CKD]] kits have been supplied to [[UzDaewooAuto]], [[Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych|FSO]] and [[Automobile Craiova|Rodae]], to be built and sold in [[Uzbekistan]], Poland and [[Romania]] respectively. At the beginning of 2005, FSO began marketing the Matiz under their own brand. New models of the Chevrolet Matiz are sold as the Chevrolet Spark in the UK, due to a rename in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHEVROLET MATIZ (model family) – How Many Left? |url=http://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/family/chevrolet_matiz#!newreg |publisher=How Many Left |location=UK |accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHEVROLET SPARK (model family) – How Many Left? |url=http://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/family/chevrolet_spark#!newreg |publisher=How Many Left |location=UK |accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Americas ===
In Mexico, the Matiz was introduced to the market in 2003. The 2006 model was renamed to '''Pontiac Matiz G2'''. It was also sold as Pontiac Matiz and Pontiac G2. The Pontiac G2 was discontinued in Mexico after a short run of 2010 models as the brand was closed by General Motors. The new version was officially launched as the Chevrolet Spark in August 2010, and the Matiz continues to be sold alongside the Spark. An M300-based vehicle is currently in production in [[Brazil]] as a replacement for the [[Chevrolet Celta]]. In [[Colombia]], the Matiz was imported by Daewoo distributors between 2002 and 2005 and then GM Colmotores began to assemble and sell it branded as Chevrolet Spark. In 2006, a taxi version called ''7/24'' was launched. In [[Costa Rica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Panama]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]], it is sold as the Chevrolet Spark. In [[Argentina]], the first generation was sold as the Daewoo Matiz through Daewoo importers. The second generation was sold as Chevrolet Spark through Chevrolet dealers. Since 2011, the third generation is available. In [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], the former version is sold as the Chevrolet Spark, and the latest version as the Chevrolet Spark GT. In [[Paraguay]], it was initially sold as Daewoo Matiz, but from 2008, it is sold through Chevrolet dealers.

In North America, the Spark is available in three distinct models: the '''1LS''', '''1LT''', and '''2LT''', as well as the '''EV'''. The equipment on these models are as follows:

'''1LS''': Power windows, cloth seating surfaces w/color-keyed inserts, color-keyed interior trim, fifteen-inch alloy wheels, AM/FM stereo w/auxiliary audio input jack, four speakers, four-passenger seating, fold-down rear split seat, [[OnStar]], air conditioning, I4 engine, 6-speed manual transmission, front-wheel-drive, and more.

'''1LT''' adds: Power door locks, Security system, AM/FM touch-screen [[MyLink]] stereo w/USB and auxiliary audio input jacks, Bluetooth w/Stereo Streaming and app capabilities, and SiriusXM Satellite Radio, steering wheel-mounted audio system controls, six speakers, and cruise control.

'''2LT''' adds: Leatherette seating surfaces, power driver's seat, continuously variable transmission (CVT), and alloy wheels w/black-painted accents.

The '''EV''' is based on the '''2LT''' model, and adds unique alloy wheels with black-painted accents, replaces the I4 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission with an electric motor, a fixed, 3.87 ratio reduction gear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://insideevs.com/2015-chevy-spark-ev-highlighting-changes/ |title=2015 Chevy Spark EV – Highlighting The Changes |first=Eric |last=Loveday |work=Inside EVs |date=May 15, 2014 |accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and closes off the front grille due to being entirely electric.

=== Africa ===
In South Africa, [[General Motors South Africa]] (GMSA) announced on October 2, 2010, plans to manufacture the new Chevrolet Spark at its Port Elizabeth plant. The second generation Spark is still sold, though branded as a 'Spark Lite'.

=== Middle East ===
In [[Iran]], the Matiz was produced (first imported and later assembled) and known as Daewoo Matiz. In [[Israel]], UMI (Universal Motors Israel) announced on January 18, 2011 the marketing commencement of the 1.2L Chevrolet Spark model.

=== Australasia ===
&lt;!--
    Yes, Australasia is the correct word for Australia, New Zealand and nearby islands.

Within [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the Spark is sold through [[Holden]]. Sales commenced in February 2016, with two specifications launched. The LS was the base specification, which features steel wheels, central locking as well as Holden's MyLink infotainment system. Building upon the LS, the LT adds 15 inch Alloy Wheels, Keyless entry and a rear view camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.themotorreport.com.au/car-article/2016-holden-spark-prices-specifications-and-features-84601.html |title=2016 Holden Spark - Prices, Specifications and Features |publisher=The Motor Report |accessdate=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With Light Car sales sliding in Australia, Holden announced in April 2018 that they would discontinue the Spark in Australia. {{asof|2018}}, it continued to be sold in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.motoring.com.au/holden-extinguishes-spark-112246/|title=Holden extinguishes Spark |publisher=Motoring |accessdate=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Astro''' is a [[van]] that was manufactured and marketed by the [[Chevrolet]] division of American auto manufacturer [[General Motors]] from 1985 to 2005. Sold alongside the '''GMC Safari''', the Astro was marketed in multiple configurations, including [[Minivan|passenger minivan]] and cargo van.      

The Astro and Safari are GM M-body vehicles, using a rear-wheel drive chassis; all-wheel drive became an option in 1990. For its entire production, the Astro and Safari were produced by [[Baltimore Assembly]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]; the vans would be the final model line produced by the facility. In total, approximately 3.2 million Astros and Safaris were produced from 1985 to 2005.    

==Background==
The Astro and Safari were introduced for 1985 as the first minivan from General Motors. While marketed as a response to the [[Chrysler minivans (S)|first-generation Chrysler minivans]], GM adapted a rear-wheel drive layout, sizing the Astro and Safari closely to the short-wheelbase [[Chevrolet van|Chevrolet G10 van]]. Similar to the [[Ford Aerostar]], to reduce production costs, GM adapted light-truck powertrain components; engines and transmissions were sourced from the [[Chevrolet S-10]], allowing for a towing capacity of up to {{convert|5500|lb|abbr=on}}.   

Prior to its use on a minivan, the Astro nameplate was used twice by General Motors; in 1967 (for the Chevrolet Astro 1 concept car)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/2409/Chevrolet-Astro-I-Concept.html|title=Chevrolet Astro I Concept car|work=ultimatecarpage.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210130/http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/2409/Chevrolet-Astro-I-Concept.html|archivedate=March 3, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keefe|first=Don|date=December 2005|title=1967 Chevy Astro I|url=http://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hcc/2005/12/1967-Chevy-Astro-I/1281650.html|url-status=live|journal=Hemmings|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105094844/https://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hcc/2005/12/1967-Chevy-Astro-I/1281650.html|archivedate=January 5, 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1969 to 1987 (on the [[Chevrolet Titan|GMC Astro]] COE semitractor).  GMC sourced the Safari nameplate from Pontiac (used by the latter to denote woodgrained station wagons).  As GMC was half of the Pontiac/GMC Division (later including Buick), from 1985 to 1989, both GMC and Pontiac Safaris were simultaneously offered through the same dealership network.

[[File:1st-GMC-Safari.jpg|thumb|left|1st-gen GMC Safari]]

Initial advertising boasted that it was a vehicle that will "make you realize that life is too big for a [[minivan]]", referring to the [[Chrysler minivans]]. The van can have a seating configuration between two and eight passengers.

Engine choices ranged from a {{convert|98|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2.5 L four-cylinder to a {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4.3 L V6, depending on options and/or model year. The 4-cylinder engine was only offered in cargo versions of the Astro; it was dropped after 1990.

Much like the second-generation [[GM F platform|GM F-body]] 1970-1981 and [[GM X platform (1962)|X-body]] vehicles, the GM M-van (Astro/Safari) had a bolt-on subframe.  For the M-van, the front suspension shares most components with the [[GM B platform|GM B-body]] station wagon ([[Chevrolet Caprice]], [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]] and larger variants of the [[Pontiac Safari]] and [[Buick Estate Wagon]]) with a leaf-spring rear suspension. The lower ball joints were larger than their [[GM B platform|B-body]] counterparts (similar to 1977-96 Cadillac D platform vehicles, e.g., Fleetwood limousines). These ball joints were later used in the final Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (police package) cars manufactured in 1995 and 1996. They also shared many mechanical similarities to the [[GM GMT platform|GMT 325/330]] midsize S/T pickups and utility vehicles.

Digital dashboards were offered in the first generation Astro; this option did not continue after 1994.

1989 was the final year that the [[Borg-Warner T-5 transmission|Borg Warner T-5]] manual transmission was made available. All subsequent models were equipped with 700R4/4l60 automatic transmissions through 1993.
 
In 1990 a new [[all-wheel drive]] (AWD) system (the first U.S.-built minivan to do so),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of 4x4's 1945-1993|year=1993|publisher=Krause Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed and developed by [[FF Developments]] (FFD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=No giant here — FF Developments Ltd. — company profile |date=December 1999

The AWD models had a lower fuel economy: 17 miles per gallon highway versus 20 to 21 miles per gallon for rear-wheel drive vans. AWD Astros used a Borg Warner 4472 transfer case.

Also in 1990, a new analog dashboard was introduced along with the availability of an extended body option, sharing its wheelbase with the shorter version. The 1990 model year also introduced the hydroboost braking system, a system using the same accessory belt driven pump to supply the power steering and brakes.

In 1992, a new optional door form was introduced, colloquially known as Dutch doors. This form was two bi-parting doors with a flip-up window above. Previously, Astro and Safari vans were equipped only with bi-parting doors. An optional 4.3 L (RPO L35) engine with central port injection and a balance shaft was phased in.

In 1993, the electronically controlled 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive became standard as the sole transmission offering. As with many other 1993 model year GM vehicles, [[Scotchgard]] fabric protection also became a standard feature on Astro vans equipped with cloth seats. 1994 also saw the addition of three new exterior paint colors. These colors were Indigo Blue Metallic (#39), Light Quasar Blue Metallic (#20), and Medium Quasar Blue Metallic (#80).

For the 1994 model year, GM started manufacturing most of their vehicles, including the Astro and Safari, with CFC-free air-conditioning systems, which used R134a refrigerant instead of R-12 refrigerant.

In 1995, the model was facelifted with an extended nose that resembled the then-new full-size Express vans; while the original square sealed beam headlights were retained for use on the cargo vans, the passenger-carrying variants now used horizontally-mounted rectangular headlights that had debuted on the full-size trucks in 1992, and would eventually appear on the smaller trucks in 1998. Also for 1995, the shorter length body was dropped. In 1996, a redesigned dash received a passenger side air-bag. The vans remained mostly unchanged until the end of production in 2005.

In 2003, GM upgraded the chassis of both the Astro and Safari with certain suspension components, larger brakes, and six-lug, 16&amp;nbsp;inch wheels from the full-size Chevrolet and GMC half-ton pickup trucks.

The Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari twins were originally scheduled to be discontinued after 2002, but they soldiered on because of good sales; the last Astro and Safari rolled off the assembly line on May 13, 2005.

=== Safety and crash testing ===
The [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS), gave the Astro a "Poor" rating in 1996 because of a display of [[structural failure]] in the Institute's {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} [[crash test]] into a fixed, offset barrier. The underbody of the test van buckled, pitching both front seats forward and shoving the crash [[mannequin|dummy]] into the dashboard and [[steering wheel]], and resulting in a broken left leg, leading the Institute to comment that "[t]he collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=66 |title=Vehicle ratings - Chevrolet Astro 1996-2005 models |work=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Highway Loss Data Institute |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060602105543/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=66 |archivedate=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In testing performed by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA), however, the Astro and Safari fared better, improving from a single-star rating in 1991 to a three-star (driver) and four-star (passenger) rating by 2000. In side impacts, the Astro and Safari both received the highest, five-star rating in every year that the test was administered.

In 2007, the IIHS reported that the 2001–2004 model year Chevrolet Astro recorded during calendar years 2002–2005 the least number of killed drivers of all passenger vehicles in the United States, as calculated per every million units on the road. Driver's habits and vehicle usage might have influenced this result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4204.pdf |title=Drivers deaths by make and model: fatality risk in one vehicle versus another |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |journal=Status Report |volume=42 |issue=4 |date=April 19, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140117080040/http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4204.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Avalanche''' is a four-door, five or six passenger [[pickup truck]] sharing [[General Motors|GM's]] long-wheelbase chassis used on the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Cadillac Escalade EXT]]. Breaking with a long-standing tradition, the Avalanche was not available as a [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], but only as a [[Chevrolet]]. Production of the Avalanche started in 
September 2001 and ended April 2013; producing two generations in its lifespan.

The Avalanche was launched in September 2001 as a 2002 model on the [[GMT800]] platform. First year Avalanches featured light gray plastic body cladding, intended to provide visual distinction from the [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban/Yukon XL]]. Avalanche also gave the public an advance look at the next generation of front fascia designs for the entire GM line. A full-length chrome strip splits each lamp assembly and the grille, with a gold Chevrolet "bow tie" in the center. The hood and fenders featured aggressive folds, in contrast to the soft box of the other GMT800 models.

[[File:2003-06 Chevrolet Avalanche WBH.jpg|thumb|left|GMT800 Chevrolet Avalanche WBH]]

2003 models featured a darker cladding, but GM's new president, [[Rick Wagoner]], demanded the removal of this "unpopular" trim (as did certain elements of the public). From mid-year, Avalanche could be ordered without the cladding. The uncladded model, known as the Without Body Hardware (or better by its acronym "WBH"), and alternatively called "slicksides" by GM marketers, resembles the '03-'05 [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado]] in the front.

Avalanche was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American SUV of the Year]]'' award and was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] for 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/truck/truck_of_the_year_winners/index.html |title=Motor Trend Trucks of the Year Winners List |publisher=Motortrend.com |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two engine choices:

* A [[GM small-block engine|Vortec]] 5.3&amp;nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]] producing 285&amp;nbsp;hp (216&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]]), for the half-ton 1500 series;
* A [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#8100|Vortec]] 8.1&amp;nbsp;L V8 with 340&amp;nbsp;hp (253&amp;nbsp;kW) and the [[GM 4L80-E transmission#4L85-E|4L85-E]] four-speed transmission, for the three-quarter-ton 2500 series. The drive train is [[rear-wheel drive]] or available with selectable high/low  [[four-wheel drive]].

The Avalanche was originally marketed as being able to "change from an SUV to a super SUV". This was made possible by a plastic cover and an exclusive "midgate", called the Convert-a-Cab system by GM, which could open and close. The midgate was a divider behind the second row of seats that could be folded down, with the seats, to create a longer bed area, or folded up to make a larger cab area. A similar midgate was found on the Cadillac Escalade EXT, Hummer H2 SUT and the GMC Envoy XUV.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/Avalanche/2002-Chevrolet-Avalanche.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who planned to go off-road in their Avalanche, a Z71 Off-Road package was available that added off-road suspension, GM's AutoTrac full-time, push-button four-wheel-drive system, all-terrain P265/70R17 white-lettered [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tires, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, leather seating surfaces with waterproof accents, front dual power bucket seats, cloth door panel inserts, GM's OnStar telematics system, all-weather rubber floor mats, Chevrolet bowtie emblems embedded into the backrests of the seats (for 2002 models), dual-zone automatic climate controls with rear HVAC vents and remote controls, remote radio controls with headphone jacks for two pairs of headphones, a security system, gray-finished side running boards, power-adjustable, heated, side view mirrors, SRS side impact airbags, and more. Aside from these details, a Z71 Off-Road decal on the rear side panels identified an Avalanche equipped with this package. Full leather seating surfaces were an available option, also removing the cloth door panel inserts, and also added heated front seats.

For those who liked the styling of the Z71 Off-Road package but did not plan to take their Avalanche off-road, a Z66 Premium On-Road package was also available. The Z66 On-Road package featured all the equipment that the Z71 Off-Road package offered, but replaced the off-road suspension with sport on-road suspension, and did not offer four-wheel-drive. Aside from these details, a Z66 On-Road sticker on the rear side panels identified an Avalanche equipped with this package. As with the Z71 Off-Road package, full leather seating surfaces without the cloth accents were an available option, also removing the cloth door panel inserts, and also added heated front seats.

To further distinguish it from its Silverado siblings, the Avalanche was practically fully equipped and only came with bodyside cladding. The Avalanche included features such as sixteen-inch [[alloy wheels]] and tires (chromed steel on the 2500 model), an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player and six speakers, cloth seating surfaces, front bench seat with power front driver's seat, power windows, power door locks, [[keyless entry]], full instrumentation, dual front [[airbags]], and [[air conditioning]]. Options included [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, [[cassette player]], [[leather]] seating surfaces, front dual power bucket seats that could be heated, and side [[airbags]] for the front seats. A [[The North Face|North Face]] Edition, in partnership with the North Face brand included limited exterior color options, a unique Ebony/Green [[leather]] interior, special exterior ornamentation and decals, white-faced gauges, [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, specially colored door panel inserts and speaker grilles, and more.

For 2003, the Avalanche was slightly changed. A new interior, shared with the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban]], added a new, larger steering wheel with subsequent audio system and [[OnStar]] controls and cruise and speed controls, an optional six-speaker premium [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system with external [[amplifier]], a new gauge cluster with information center, memory for the front driver's seat, brake and accelerator pedals and side view mirror position (on some models), new radio [[head units]], which included an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and [[Radio Data System]] or an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD/MP3 changer and [[Radio Data System]], optional [[XM Satellite Radio]], standard [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, optional rear audio controls with [[heaphone]] jacks, an optional rear [[DVD]] entertainment system by [[Panasonic]] with wireless headphones, new warning chimes that played through the vehicle's audio system instead of through a separate speaker behind the dashboard, and newly available seventeen-inch [[alloy wheels]] and tires.

===Cladding trouble===
Soon after the release of the Chevrolet Avalanche, customers began to notice cosmetic problems with the [[cladding (metalworking)|cladding]] on their vehicles. Over time exposure to heat and sunlight would cause a chalky faded appearance. It was especially noticeable on the cargo bed panels, and sail-panel windows where "Zebra Striping" would appear. Customer reaction to this problem resulted in General Motors agreeing to a one time treatment of a product called ArmorDillo. This product would temporarily restore the cladding for a period of about 6 months. After that it would wear off then need to be re-applied. Realizing this was not a permanent solution, GM, together with Gatorback Coatings, developed a coating that could be applied to the cladding to restore it to a like-new shine. This product was designed to etch into the plastic and bond a new layer of tinted acrylic over the faded plastic. Customers within the 3yr/36,000 original factory warranty could go to their dealership to have it restored under their original warranty under GM TSB:04-08-111-001C. General Motors did not use side body cladding on the second generation model. General Motors has also identified the original source of the faded cladding.

The [[GMT900]] Avalanche was introduced at the [[Chicago Auto Show]] in February 2006. Production of the redesigned Avalanche began at the [[Silao Assembly]] in April 2006. The Avalanche maintained the styled front end much like its sister vehicles, the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe/Yukon]] and Suburban/Yukon XL, yet it still had the distinct midgate and integrated bed as found on the previous incarnation. It had all the same standard and available features as the Suburban and the Tahoe. The 2500 model of the previous generation was discontinued.

A special Z71 package was offered for the second generation Avalanche. This off-road package consisted of a suspension tuned for rough terrain, an exclusive automatic locking rear differential, aluminum under body skid plates (visible from the front of the pickup truck), wheel flares, badges, wheels and tires.

Later models introduced another version of the Vortec 5.3-liter V8 as the engine is now capable of running on E85 ethanol. When the 5.3 is running on normal gasoline, it produces {{convert|320|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|335|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque whereas its output rises to {{convert|326|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|348|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque on E85, up from {{convert|310|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|335|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} in 2009. For the 2010 model year, the 6.0-liter was dropped from the Avalanche lineup which left the 5.3 V8 as the only engine available for the SUV. In its final year, the 6.0-liter produced {{convert|366|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|376|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.

A 2007 Avalanche was given away to the Most Valuable Player of the [[2006 in baseball|2006]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], [[Michael Young (baseball player)|Michael Young]].

An Avalanche is regularly featured on the popular US crime drama [[CSI: New York]] and is driven by some members of the team.

In addition, a 2007 Z-71 Avalanche placed second in [[Speed TV]]'s reality TV series '[[Bullrun (TV series)|Bullrun]]' in 2009.

===Trim Levels===

The second-generation Avalanche came in three well-equipped trim levels:

The '''LS''' served as the base model Avalanche. It included seventeen-inch [[alloy wheels]] and tires, cloth seating surfaces, power front driver's bucket seat, [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and auxiliary audio input jack with six speakers, [[keyless entry]], and black door handles, tailgate handle, and side mirrors, aluminum interior trim, front and side [[airbags]], [[traction control]], [[StabiliTrak]], and more.

The '''LT''' served as the midlevel model Avalanche. It added power dual front bucket seats, [[remote start]], [[XM Satellite Radio]], [[Bluetooth]] hands-free telephone system, and exterior color-keyed door handles, tailgate handle, and side mirrors, wood interior trim, as well as other features.

The '''LTZ''' was the top-of-the-line model Avalanche. It added leather seating surfaces, [[security alarm]], an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD/MP3/DVD changer, an eight-speaker premium [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] CenterPoint amplified [[surround sound]] system, memory for the front driver's seat, twenty-inch polished [[alloy wheels]] and tires, and rear seat audio and video system controls, and the LTZ exclusive self-leveling Auto Ride suspension.

===Black Diamond Edition===

2013 marked the Avalanche's last year of production. For 2013, all Avalanches, regardless of trim level, featured the '''Black Diamond Edition Package''', which added '''Black Diamond Edition''' emblems to the rear pillars, replacing the previous trim level designation emblems, and also adding unique emblems inside the Avalanche commemorating its production from 2002 to 2013. The 2013 Avalanche was produced in limited numbers. Each 2013 Avalanche buyer received a limited-edition coffee table book with photographs of the owner's 2013 Avalanche, a copy of the [[window sticker]] from their vehicle, and a complete history of the Avalanche from 2002 to 2013. The book was shipped to either the [[Car dealership|dealership]] or owner's home after the owner took delivery of their new 2013 Avalanche. In addition, a newly available color, named Fairway Green Metallic, commemorated the last year of production for the Avalanche (2013).

Engines:

The second generation '''Chevrolet Volt''' [[plug-in hybrid]] debuted at the 2015 [[North American International Auto Show]] to replace the original [[Chevrolet Volt (first generation)|Volt]], on sale since 2010.&lt;ref name=Sales2016Volt/&gt; Retail deliveries as a 2016 [[model year]] began in October 2015 in the U.S. and Canada,&lt;ref name=Volt2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canada2015/&gt; and it was released in Mexico in December 2015.&lt;ref name=Mex2015/&gt; Availability of the 2016 model was limited to California and the other 10 states that follow California's zero emission vehicle regulations.&lt;ref name=Volt2016/&gt; It went on sale as a 2017 model year in the rest of the U.S. in February 2016.&lt;ref name=2017Volt/&gt;  Volt production ended on February 15, 2019.&lt;ref name="End2019"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2019/02/22/gm-detroit-hamtramck-production-extended-january-2020/2950083002/ |title=GM's Detroit-Hamtramck production extended to January 2020 |last=Naughton |first=Nora |work=[[Detroit News]] |date=2019-02-22 |access-date=2019-02-23|language=en|quote=Production of the Buick LaCrosse and Chevrolet Volt ended on Feb. 15, GM spokesman Dan Flores said}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Featuring a restyled exterior and interior, the Volt's revised battery system and drivetrain allow, under the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) cycle, an [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|53|mi|abbr=on}}, up from the first generation's {{Convert|38|mi|abbr=on}}. The EPA combined fuel economy in gasoline-only mode was rated at {{Convert|42|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, up from {{Convert|37|mpgUS|abbr=on}} for the previous generation. The official rating for combined city/highway fuel economy in [[all-electric mode]] is 106 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e), up from 98 MPG-e for the 2015 first generation model.&lt;ref name=EPAVolt2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Volt2015_2016/&gt;

The Volt's revised batteries and [[GM Voltec powertrain|Voltec powertrain]] feature a larger 1.5-liter [[range extender (vehicle)|range extender]] engine tuned for regular gasoline instead of premium required by the first generation.&lt;ref name=Sales2016Volt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/01/next-gen-chevy-volt-erev-is-more-efficient-with-50-mile-electric-range.html|title=Next-gen Chevy Volt EREV is more efficient, with 50-mile electric range|author=Mike Millikin |work=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2015-01-12|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=2016 Chevrolet Volt revealed early at CES|url=http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/chevrolet-volt-revealed-early-ces|website=Autoweek|accessdate=2015-01-05|date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new engine is rated for 101 horsepower (75&amp;nbsp;kW), representing approximately 20% more power than the engine used in the previous generation.&lt;ref name=2016ChevroletVoltDissected&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2016-chevrolet-volt-dissected-everything-you-need-to-know-feature|title=2016 Chevrolet Volt Dissected: Powertrain, Design, Chassis, and More|author=Pearley Huffman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first Voltec iteration, the second generation battery pack uses battery cells by [[LG Chem]]. Their new chemistry reportedly stores 20% more electrical energy. The second generation battery pack uses fewer cells (192 vs 288), weighs {{Convert|13|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}} less and features a capacity increased to 18.4 [[kWh]]. The battery pack is projected to use a power controller integral to the motor housing with electric motors weighing {{Convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} less while using less [[rare-earth metal]].&lt;ref name=Sales2016Volt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthé|first1=Roland|last2=Eberle|first2=Ulrich|title=The Voltec system-Energy storage and electric propulsion|pages=151–176|chapter-url=|publisher=Elsevier|date=2014-01-09|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-59513-3.00008-X|chapter=The Voltec System—Energy Storage and Electric Propulsion|isbn=9780444595133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holloway|first1=Hilton|title=All-new Chevrolet Volt previewed|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/all-new-chevrolet-volt-previewed|website=Autocar|accessdate=2015-01-05|date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the US 2019 final model year (2018-2019 calendar year), Chevrolet has added the following new features:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2018/jun/0628-volt.html|title=2019 Chevrolet Volt|date=2018-06-28|website=media.gm.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 7.2&amp;nbsp;kW charging system standard on the 2019 Volt Premier. 7.2 kW charging system upgrade is a factory option on the 2019 Volt LT.
* Option to defer automatic engine-assisted heating system for more all-electric operation. New threshold is minus 13 degrees F / minus 25 degrees C.
* Option to configure Low and Regen on Demand profiles that enable increased regenerative braking capabilities. This improves electric vehicle range and reduces wear and tear on friction brakes.
* New Chevrolet Infotainment 3 system with 8-inch-diagonal color touchscreen. The Infotainment 3 system provides a new energy app as well as capabilities for over the air updates.
* New digital rear-view camera replacing the previous analog system. 
* New driver-switchable Adaptive Cruise Control option.
* Power driver seat standard on 2019 Volt Premier and optional on 2019 Volt LT.

==Reception==
[[File:Chevrolet Volt badge WAS 2017 1521.jpg|thumb|Second generation Chevrolet Volt badge]]

[[Car and Driver]] praised the shape, longer EV range, addition of a regenerative paddle, efficiency and big trunk. The reviewer did not like how the car lost its distinctive styling, that the rear middle seat had little leg room, and, at the full price of the car with all its options, one could buy a [[BMW]].  And for the "lows", Less than comfortable front seats, useless back seats and odd cornering imbalance.  Overall, Car and Driver thought the Volt has been brought to the next level.&lt;ref name="car&amp;drive1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/volt|title=The gas-electric Volt, now quicker and less eccentric, is the embodiment of New Age versatility|author=Aaron Robinson|work=[[Car and Driver]]|date=September 2015|accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-generation Volt was awarded the "2016 [[Green Car of the Year]]" by [[Green Car Journal]] at the 2016 [[LA Auto Show]]. The Volt became the first model to receive this award more than once.&lt;ref name=GCOY2016&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/11/19/2016-chevy-volt-green-car-year/|title=2016 Chevy Volt wins Green Car of the Year |author=Sebastian Blanco| work=Autoblog Green |date=2015-11-19|accessdate=2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation Volt scored a "Top Safety Pick+" rating by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS). The plug-in hybrid scored a "Good" rating in all of the [[IIHS]] crash worthiness tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insideevs.com/2017-chevrolet-volt-top-safety-pick-according-iihs/ |title=2017 Chevrolet Volt A Top Safety Pick+ According To IIHS|publisher=Inside EVs |first=Eric |last=Loveday| date=2016-09-24 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet El Camino''' is a [[coupé utility]]  vehicle that was produced by [[Chevrolet]] between 1959–60 and 1964–1987. Unlike a [[pickup truck]], the El Camino was adapted from the standard two-door Chevrolet [[station wagon]] platform and integrated the cab and cargo bed into the body.

Introduced in the 1959 [[model year]] in response to the success of the [[Ford Ranchero]] coupé utility, its first run lasted only two years. Production resumed for the 1964–1977 model years based on the [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] platform, and continued for the 1978–1987 model years based on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|GM G-body platform]].

Although based on corresponding [[General Motors]] car lines, the vehicle is classified and titled in North America as an SUV. [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]'s [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] El Camino variant, the [[GMC Sprint / Caballero#Sprint|Sprint]], was introduced for the 1971 model year. Renamed Caballero in 1978, it was also produced through the 1987 model year.

[[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford Australia]] was the first company to produce a [[coupé]] utility as a result of a 1932 letter from the wife of a farmer in [[Victoria, Australia]], asking for "a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays".&lt;ref name=fastlane&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastlane.com.au/Features/First_ute.htm |first=Gary |last=Warner |title=Who built the first utility – where – when... |publisher=fastlane.com.au |date=1999-08-08 |accessdate=2011-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529210512/http://www.fastlane.com.au/Features/First_ute.htm |archivedate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford designer [[Lewis Bandt|Lew Bandt]] developed a suitable solution, and the first coupé utility model was released in 1934.&lt;ref name=fastlane /&gt; Bandt went on to manage Ford's Advanced Design Department, being responsible for the body engineering of the XP, XT, XW, and XA series [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] utilities. [[General Motors]]’ Australian subsidiary [[Holden]] also produced a [[Chevrolet]] coupé utility in 1935, [[Studebaker]] produced the [[Studebaker Coupe Express|Coupé Express]] from 1937 to 1939. The body style did not reappear on the American market until the release of the 1957 [[Ford Ranchero]].

Both the coupé utility and the similar open-topped [[roadster utility]] continued in production, but the improving economy of the mid- to late-1930s and the desire for improved comfort saw coupé utility sales climb at the expense of the roadster utility until, by 1939, the latter was all but a fading memory.

The mid-1955 introduction of Chevrolet's '''Cameo Carrier''' [[pickup truck]] helped pave the way for the El Camino. Although it was a model variant of Chevrolet's [[Chevrolet Task Force|Task Force]] light-duty pickup, the Cameo offered an array of car-like features that included passenger-car styling, fiberglass rear fenders, two-tone paint, a relatively luxurious interior, as well as an optional V8 engine, automatic transmission, and power assists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1955-chevrolet-cameo-carrier.htm |title=1955 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2011-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As always, there was a [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] version offered during the same time, called the GMC '''Suburban''' with the same features offered on the Chevrolet. In 1957 a special version was made for GMC to be shown at national car shows called the '''Palomino''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1955gmc.com/1957palomino.html|title=1957 GMC Palomino|publisher=1955 GMC Truck Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a [[Pontiac V8 engine#347|Pontiac {{convert|347|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] installed, borrowed from the 1957 [[Pontiac Star Chief#Second generation (1955–1957)|Star Chief]].

Other pickup truck producers, including Dodge, Ford, Studebaker, and International, began to offer flush-side cargo boxes on some of their 1957 models, such as the [[Dodge C Series]], and the [[Studebaker E-series truck|Studebaker E-series Deluxe]]. However, Ford also introduced the 1957 Ranchero, and established a new market segment in the U.S. market of an [[automobile platform]] based coupé utility. In 1959, Chevrolet responded with the El Camino to compete with Ford's full-sized Ranchero. The original El Camino and Ranchero would compete directly only in the 1959 model year.&lt;ref name="The Editors of Consumer Guide"&gt;The Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The El Camino was introduced for the 1959 model year two years after the [[Ford Ranchero]]. According to Chevrolet stylist Chuck Jordan, GM [[Harley Earl]] had suggested a coupé pickup in 1952.

Like the Ranchero, it was based on an existing and modified platform, the new-for-1959 [[Chevrolet Brookwood|Brookwood]] two-door station wagon, itself based on the completely redesigned, longer, lower and wider full-sized Chevrolet. Highly stylized, it initially sold 50% more briskly than the more conservative Ranchero, some 22,000 to 14,000.

Unlike the Brookwoods wagon and a [[sedan delivery]] variant, the El Camino was available with any full-sized Chevrolet drivetrain. It came in a single trim level, its exterior using the mid-level Bel-Air's trim, and the interior of the low-end Biscayne. Its chassis featured Chevrolet's "Safety-Girder" X-frame design and a full-coil suspension, both introduced in the 1958 model year. The {{convert|119|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} wheel-base was {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} longer, and overall length for all 1959 Chevrolets was up to {{convert|210.9|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The El Camino's payload rating ranged from {{convert|650-1150|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, with gross vehicle weights ranging from {{convert|4400-4900|lb|kg|abbr=on}} depending on powertrain and suspension. The somewhat soft passenger car suspension of the base model left the vehicle level without a load, in contrast the Ranchero, where standard 1100-pound rated heavy duty rear springs gave it a distinct rake when empty. The quirky Level Air suspension option, in its second and final year, was listed as available, but was almost never seen on any Chevrolet model, much less an El Camino. The 1959 El Camino was promoted as the first Chevrolet pickup built with a steel bed floor instead of wood. The floor was a corrugated sheetmetal insert, secured with 26 recessed bolts. Concealed beneath it was the floor pan from the Brookwood two-door wagon, complete with foot wells. Box capacity was almost {{convert|33|cuft|m3}}.

Among the performance engines offered were a 283-cid Turbo-Fire V8 with two- or four-barrel carburetion, several Turbo-Thrust 348-cid V8s with four-barrel or triple two-barrel carburetors producing {{convert|335|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and 250- and 290-bhp 283-cube Ramjet Fuel Injection V8s.

''[[Hot Rod magazine|Hot Rod]]'' magazine conducted a test of an El Camino equipped with the hottest powertrain combination available in early 1959—a {{convert|315|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, triple-carb, solid-lifter 348 V8 mated to a four-speed. Staff testers clocked 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph times of around seven seconds, estimated top speed at {{convert|130|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and predicted 14-second/100-mph quarter-mile performance with a rear-axle ratio suitable for drag racing installed.

A total of 22,246 El Caminos were produced for 1959. That bested the count of 21,706 first-year Rancheros made in 1957 and the 14,169 Ford sedan pickups built in direct competition for the 1959 model year. But 1960 would be a different story.

The similar but less flamboyant 1960 model started at $2366 for the [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] model; another $107 for a V8 with the two-barrel 283. At first glance, the exterior once again had a Bel Air look, with that series' bright-metal "jet" appliqué and narrow trailing molding used to accent the rear quarters. Inside, Biscayne/Brookwood appointments also persisted.  The seat was now covered in striped-pattern cloth with vinyl facings. Available interior trim shades were once again gray, blue, and green. Floor coverings were in medium-tone vinyl. Mid-1959 powertrain availability was carried over with minimal changes for 1960: The base 283-cid V8 was detuned a bit for fuel economy and was now rated at {{convert|170|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and the fuel-injected engines were officially gone.

Orders plummeted by a third, to just 14,163, at which point Chevrolet discontinued the model; meanwhile, Ford moved 21,027 Rancheros, which were now based on the brand-new Falcon compact. The pioneering American sedan pickups just did not connect with enough car-buying Americans. Perhaps these early "crossovers" didn't carry enough passengers; in a time when baby-boomer families dominated the market, three across was the best they could offer. Cargo volume was meager compared with pickup trucks.  The low-level trim and marketing efforts focused almost exclusively on commercial customers may have inhibited sales, as well.&lt;ref name="The Editors of Consumer Guide" /&gt;

Chevrolet reintroduced an all new, mid-size El Camino four years later based on the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]. The 1964 model was similar to the Chevelle two-door wagon forward of the B-pillars and carried both "Chevelle" and "El Camino" badges, but Chevrolet marketed the vehicle as a utility model and Chevelle's most powerful engines were not available. Initial engine offerings included six-cylinder engines of 194 and 230 cubic inches with horsepower ratings of {{convert|120 and 155|hp||abbr=on}}, respectively. The standard V8 was a 283 cubic-inch Chevrolet small block with two-barrel carburetor and {{convert|195|hp||abbr=on}} with optional engines including a {{convert|220|hp|0|abbr=on}} 283 with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Added to the El Camino's option list during the course of the 1964 model year were two versions of the 327 cubic-inch small block [[V8 engine|V8]] rated at {{convert|250 and 300|hp|0|abbr=on}}—the latter featuring a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1, larger four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts.&lt;ref&gt;1964 El Camino brochure&lt;/ref&gt; El Caminos also featured Air shocks in the rear, as well as fully boxed frames. The shocks were continued over all generations, the frames only thru 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Owner observation&lt;/ref&gt;

====1965====
The 1965 El Camino received the same facelift as the '65 Chevelle, with a more pronounced V-shaped front end, and a higher performance L79 version of the 327 engine rated at {{convert|350|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} that was also available in Chevelles. Most of the other engines were carried over from 1964, including the 194 and 230 cubic-inch Turbo Thrift sixes, the {{convert|195|hp||abbr=on}} 283 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8 and 327 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8s of {{convert|250 and 300|hp|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;1965 El Camino brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

====1966====
In 1966, GM added a {{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]] to the lineup rated from 325 to {{convert|375|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The 1965 327 would run low 15s in the 1/4 mile (at some 90&amp;nbsp;mph), while 1966 to 1969 models were easily into the mid- to upper-14s. New sheetmetal highlighted the 1966 El Camino, identical to the Chevelle. A new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer was featured. Inside, the standard version featured a bench seat interior and rubber floor mat from the low-line Chevelle 300 series, while the Custom used a more upscale interior from the Chevelle Malibu with plusher cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting, or optional Strato swivel bucket seats with console. A tachometer was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet_El_Camino-GMC_Caballero/1966_Chevrolet_El_Camino_Brochure/1966%20Chevrolet%20El%20Camino-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet_El_Camino-GMC_Caballero/1966_Chevrolet_El_Camino_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1967====
The 1967 El Camino followed the Chevelle's styling facelift with a new grille, front bumper, and trim. Air shocks remained standard equipment on the El Camino, allowing the driver to compensate for a load. The 1967 model year also brought the collapsible steering column and options of disc brakes and [[Turbo Hydramatic]] 400 3-speed [[automatic transmission]]. It was the second year the 396 (L35, L34, and L78) could be had in the El Camino (both 13480 300 Deluxe base and 13680 Malibu series). Since the L35 396/325&amp;nbsp;hp engine was the base for the SS396 series, the number of L35 engines reported sold by Chevrolet in 1967 (2,565) were sold in one of the two El Camino series, which were the only other series the engine could be ordered in. Since the L34 ({{convert|350|hp|0|abbr=on}}) &amp; L78 ({{convert|375|hp||abbr=on}}) were available in either El Camino series as well as the two SS396 body styles, there is no way of knowing how many of these optional engines went to which body style. Chevrolet does report 17,176 L34 and 612 L78 engine options were sold in 1967 Chevelles, but there is no breakdown of body styles. The TH400 3-speed automatic was now available as an option (RPO M40) with the 396 engine in both the SS396 series and the 396-equipped El Caminos. The 3-speed [[manual transmission]] remained the standard transmission with a heavy duty (RPO M13) also available along with the 2-speed Powerglide and either M20 wide ratio or M21 close ratio 4-speed transmissions. Although there was no actual factory El Camino Super Sport until 1968, many owners have "cloned" '67 SS396s using 1967 Chevelle SS396 badges and trim.

Chevrolet introduced a longer El Camino in 1968, based on the Chevelle [[station wagon]]/four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] wheelbase ({{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, overall length: {{convert|208|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}); it also shared Chevelle Malibu exterior and interior trims. The interior was revamped including cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting. All-vinyl Strato bucket seats and center console were an $111 option. Power front disc brakes and Positraction were optional. A new, high-performance Super Sport SS396 version was launched. The Turbo-Jet 396 was offered in {{convert|325|bhp|abbr=on}} or {{convert|350|bhp|abbr=on}} versions. Returning to the official options list for the first time since late 1966 was the {{convert|375|bhp|abbr=on}} L78. It had solid lifters, big-port heads, and an 800&amp;nbsp;cfm [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] four-barrel on a low-rise aluminum manifold. A three-speed manual was standard with all engines, and a four-speed or automatic was optional.
In 1968, the SS was a separate model (the "SS-396").

The 1969 models showed only minor changes, led by more-rounded front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. New round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. For the first time, the Chevrolet 350 V8 was used in an El Camino. The [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]] group included a {{convert|265 or 325|hp||abbr=on}} 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem. More potent editions of the 396 engine, developing {{convert|350 or 375|hp||abbr=on}} also made the options list. Options included power windows and locks. Curiously, back-up lights moved from the rear bumper to the tailgate, where they were ineffective when the gate was down.

The 1970 models received sheet metal revisions that gave the bodies a more squared-up stance, and interiors were also redesigned.
The new SS396, which actually displaced {{convert|402|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} (although all emblems read 396) was available. Chevrolet's largest and most-powerful engine of the time was also put into a select few El Caminos. The LS6 454&amp;nbsp;CID engine, rated at {{convert|450|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, gave the El Camino 1/4-mile times in the upper 13-second range at around {{convert|106|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The 1971 El Camino got fresh front-end styling (again shared with the Chevelle) that included large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. For 1971, mandated lower-octane unleaded fuel necessitated a reduction in engine compression, and GM's A.I.R. system, a "smog pump", was added to control tailpipe emissions.  Power and performance were reduced. Engine offerings for 1971 included the 250-6, small-block V8s of 307 and 350 cubic inches; and big block V8s of 402 and 454-cubic-inch displacements. Horsepower ratings of those engines for 1971 ranged from 145 for the six to 365 for the RPO LS5 454 – all in gross figures. The LS6 454 V8 was gone forever.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A rebadged El Camino, the [[GMC Sprint]] debuted in 1971. It shared the same engine and transmission offerings as its Chevrolet counterpart.

The 1972 El Caminos wore single-unit parking and side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille, but little changed. For 1972, horsepower measurements were switched to the "net" figures as installed in a vehicle with all accessories and emission controls hooked up. Engine offerings included the {{convert|110|hp||abbr=on}} 250-6, a 307 V8, a {{convert|175|hp||abbr=on}} 350-cubic-inch V8, and big block V8s of 402 and 454 cubic-inch displacements. The 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396) produced {{convert|240|hp|0|abbr=on}}; the 454 managed to put out {{convert|270|hp|0|abbr=on}} under the net rating system. Super Sport equipment could now be ordered with any V8 engine, including the base 307-cubic-inch version. All 1972 El Caminos with the 454 ci engine have a "W" as the fifth digit in the VIN, and the 454 was only available with Super Sport trim.

For 1973, the El Camino was redesigned. Matching the Chevelle line and using the wagon chassis, it was the largest El Camino generation. Energy-absorbing hydraulic front bumper systems on these vehicles added more weight. There were two different trim levels of El Caminos during this period. The base model and SS option shared interior and exterior appointments with the Chevelle Malibu, while the El Camino Classic (introduced for 1974) shared its trim with the more upscale Chevelle Malibu Classic.

The chassis design was as new as the bodies with {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} a wider wheel track, front and rear. The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive [[camber angle|camber]] than the right, which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the [[coil spring]]s at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front [[disc brakes]] were now standard on all '73 El Caminos. Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style outside door handles, molded full-foam seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger {{convert|22|usgal|L impgal|0|adj=on}} fuel tank, and "flush and dry" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster.&lt;ref&gt;1973–1977 Chevrolet El camino brochures&lt;/ref&gt; A benefit of the new body designs was much better visibility to which the unusually thin windshield pillars contributed. A structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. El Caminos shared the "Colonnade" frameless door glass with other Chevelles, and would continue this feature into the next generation as well.

The 307 2-barrel V8 with {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was the base engine. Options included a 350 2-barrel V8 with {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a 350 4-barrel V8 with {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and a 454 4-barrel V8 with {{convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. The three-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard; 4-speed manual and [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] 3-speed automatic transmissions were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs prevented overheating.&lt;ref name='73brochure'&gt;1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1973 El Camino.jpg|thumb|left|1973 El Camino]]
[[File:73 El Camino SS.jpg|thumb|left| 1973 El Camino SS]]

The SS, then a trim option, included a black grill with SS emblem, bodyside striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, special front and rear stabilizer bars, rally wheels, 70-series raised white-lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.&lt;ref name='73brochure' /&gt;
The SS option was available with a 350 or 454 V8 with the 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmissions.
&lt;ref&gt;Cars of the 70's – By the Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 El Caminos sported an elongated, Mercedes-type grille. Inside, the new top-of-the-line El Camino Classic featured luxurious interiors with notchback bench seats (or optional Strato bucket seats) upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels and woodgrain instrument panel trim. The 350 V8 became the base engine and a 400 V8 engine was new this year. The 454, the top engine, was available with the Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 automatic or 4-speed manual transmission.

The 1975 models featured a new grill, providing a fresh appearance. Suspension upgrades offered a quieter ride, and radial-ply tires became standard. Dual remote mirrors, new twin sport mirrors, intermittent wipers, and cruise control were among new convenience features this year. The 1975 high energy ignition (HEI) provided spark to the spark plugs with minimal maintenance and increased power. The larger distributor cap also provided better high-RPM performance by decreasing the likelihood of the spark conducting to the wrong terminal. The 250-cubic-inch in-line six of {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was offered as the base engine. The 454-cubic-inch V8, downrated yet again to {{convert|215|hp||abbr=on}}, made it into 1975 as an El Camino option, but this would be its last go-around. It was not available in California, and the optional four-speed stick was no longer offered. Buyers could now choose an Econominder instrument package that included a vacuum gauge to point out when optimum fuel economy was being attained.

[[File:1977 El Camino Classic front.jpg|thumb|1977 El Camino Classic]]
For 1976, El Camino Classic models now featured the new rectangular headlights that other high-end GM cars were sporting. These were quad units in stacked arrangement. The base model retained the previously used dual round headlights. Engines included the base 250 I6 engine, a new {{convert|140|hp|0|abbr=on}} 305-cubic-inch V8, two- and four-barrel 350s (with availability still depending on California delivery), and the 400-cubic-inch V8, still good for {{convert|175|hp||abbr=on}}. All engines except the 250 I6 came with the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmission as the only transmission available. The 250 I6 came with a 3-speed manual or an optional Turbo Hydra-matic.

The 1977 models were little changed, except the 400 V8 was gone. The El Camino Classic was again the top model and the SS option continued.&lt;ref&gt;1973–77 El Camino brochures&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978 through 1987 El Caminos were produced in four trim levels: Classic, Black Knight (1978)/Royal Knight (1979–83), Conquista and [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]], and shared chassis components with the [[Chevrolet Malibu]]. Chevrolet 90° V6 and [[Buick V6 engine]]s were used for the first time. The optional 305 cubic-inch small block V8 was rated at {{convert|150 or 165|hp||abbr=on}}, and from 1982–1984, the [[Oldsmobile]]-sourced [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|diesel engine]] was also optional.

A new, [[Downsize (automobile)|trimmer]] El Camino was unveiled in 1978, adopting the new, more sharp-edged Malibu styling, and a one-inch longer wheelbase of {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The front end sheet metal and doors were shared with the Malibu, and the rear tailgate and bumper was shared with the Malibu station wagon. For the first time, though, the El Camino had a unique chassis – it was shared with no other Chevrolet. The front end featured a new single rectangular headlight design. The base engine was a 200-cubic-inch (3.3-liter) V6 that developed {{convert|95|hp||abbr=on}}, except in California where, to meet emissions standards, the 231-cubic-inch Buick engine was the base engine. Two upgrades could be ordered: a 305-cubic-inch V8 with {{convert|145|hp||abbr=on}}, or a 350-cubic-inch V8 with {{convert|170|hp|0|abbr=on}} that was only available in El Caminos and Malibu station wagons. It was not available on Malibu passenger cars (with exception to coupe and sedan Malibu 9C1 police vehicles). Among GM makes, at least, the era of bigness was fading into history, overtaken by a new age of efficiency and economy.

The 1979 model got minimal changes following its debut as a redesigned "new-size" model in 1978. Alterations to the 1979 El Camino amounting to little more than a new divided grille. However, a "small-block" 267-cubic-inch (4.4-liter) V8 joined the options list and slotted between the standard 3.3-liter V6 and the optional 5.0-liter four-barrel V8. The 350-cubic-inch (5.7-liter) V8, developing {{convert|170|hp|0|abbr=on}} was again available. Both three- and four-speed manual transmissions had floor shifters.

The 1980 El Camino started out the 1980s with few changes, though engine choices were shuffled a little. The base V6 displaced 229 cubic inches, up from 200 the year before. Horsepower increased from {{convert|94 to 115|hp||abbr=on}}. Optional again were a 267-cubic-inch V8 with {{convert|125|hp||abbr=on}} and a 305 V8, now with {{convert|155|hp||abbr=on}} (down five). The 350 with {{convert|170|hp|0|abbr=on}} offered in 1979 was dropped. A three speed floor shifted manual transmission was standard, but most got the optional three-speed automatic.

The 1981 models received a new horizontal tube grill. The 1981 engines mostly continued from 1980, but now used GM's Computer Command Control (CCC) emission system. The base 229-cubic-inch V6 made {{convert|110|hp||abbr=on}} (down from {{convert|115|hp||abbr=on}}), as did the California-only 231-cubic-inch Buick V6. Optional engines were the 267-cubic-inch V8 with {{convert|115|hp||abbr=on}} and The 305-cubic-inch V8, now with {{convert|150|hp|0|abbr=on}}. The three-speed automatic added a lock-up torque converter to aid highway mileage.

====1982====
The 1982 (through the final 1987) El Camino sported a new frontal appearance with a crosshatch grille flanked by quad rectangular headlights. New under the hood for 1982 was a {{convert|105|hp||abbr=on}} 5.7-liter (350-cubic-inch) [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] V8, which was also offered in Chevrolet's full-size cars. Though mileage with the diesel was commendable, it was an expensive option and would eventually amass a dismal repair record. Gasoline-engine choices were unchanged, except Chevrolet's 229-cubic-inch (3.8-liter) V6 was now standard in California-bound cars, replacing Buick's 231-cubic-inch V6.

In 1983, the 4.4-liter V8 was gone, leaving the 5.0-liter version as the only optional gas V8. The standard engine was again Chevrolet's 3.8-liter V6 with {{convert|110|hp||abbr=on}}, though California cars, once again, got a Buick V6 with similar specifications. Continuing on the options list was the 5.7-liter V8 Diesel with {{convert|105|hp|abbr=on}}. The sister Malibu sedan and wagon were discontinued after the 1983 model year.

The 1983–87 El Camino SS was offered as a conversion (completed by Choo-Choo Customs Inc., of Chattanooga, Tennessee) to include the aerodynamic front end similar to the Monte Carlo SS, but did not receive the L69 engine package.

====1985-1987====

GM shifted El Camino production to [[Mexico]], and the new fuel-injected 4.3&amp;nbsp;L V6 became the base engine through 1987. El Camino production ended quietly in late 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20020826/SUB/208260746|title=Briefly – Blast from the past?|publisher=Automotive News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some model year 1987's (420 El Caminos and 325 GMC Caballeros) are listed as new car retail deliveries in calendar year 1988 based on their date of first retail sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://blog.elcaminostore.com/el-camino-timeline-1959-1987/|title=El Camino Timeline – Changes From 1959–1987|publisher=Eckler's El Camino Store}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation in online forums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.elcaminocentral.com/showthread.php?t=44295|title=Since we've never seen a 1988 El Camino|website=El Camino Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates 3GCCW80H2HS915586 "may" be the final vehicle.

==Concept vehicles==
In 1974, Chevrolet's sister division, Pontiac, reportedly took an El Camino body, grafted on the urethane-nose front end from its [[Pontiac Grand Am|Grand Am]] series, added the GA's instrument panel, reclining Strato-bucket seats with adjustable lumbar support along with Pontiac's Rally II wheels. This was a styling exercise for a possible Pontiac version of the El Camino; the concept never reached production.

In 1992, GM unveiled an El Camino concept, basically a pickup variant of the [[Chevrolet Lumina Z34]]. The concept received mixed, mostly negative reviews, mostly because of its front wheel drive layout.

[[File:2010 Pontiac G8 Sport Truck.jpg|thumb|2010 Pontiac G8 ST concept at the 2008 [[New York Auto Show]].|alt=]]
During the 1995 model year, GM had a concept El Camino based on the full-size
[[Chevrolet Caprice#Fourth generation (1991–1996)|Caprice]] station wagon using the grille of a 1994–96 [[Chevrolet Impala#Seventh generation (1994–1996)|Impala SS]]; this concept was destined for production, but was shelved when GM decided to discontinue the B-platform car line at the end of 1996.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The Pontiac G8 ST was shown at the [[New York International Auto Show#2008|New York International Auto Show]] in March 2008. Based on the [[Holden Commodore]] Ute, it shared the G8 platform with a {{convert|73|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} cargo bed. The Sport Truck had the same {{convert|361|hp|abbr=on}}, 6.0-liter V8 used in the G8 GT, as well as the 3.6-liter, {{convert|300|hp|abbr=on}} direct-injection V6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do?domain=30&amp;docid=47838|title= Pontiac Names All New Sport Truck The "G8 ST"|accessdate= 6 January 2009|archive-url= https://archive.today/20080819220147/http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewpressreldetail.do%3Fdomain=30&amp;docid=47838#|archive-date= 2008-08-19|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The G8 ST was slated for release as a 2010 model, but in January 2009, GM announced to dealers the G8 ST was cancelled due to budget cuts and restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20090106/BUSINESS01/90106080/1014|title=GM kills Pontiac G8 Sport Truck|publisher=Freep}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, GM again considered bringing back the El Camino under the Chevrolet brand as early as 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5714515/chevy-considers-return-of-the-el-camino|title=Chevy Considers Return of the El Camino|publisher=Jalopnik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Tracker''', formerly the '''Geo Tracker''', is a [[mini SUV]] produced for [[Chevrolet]] and [[Geo (automobile)|Geo]] by [[CAMI Automotive]] in Ingersoll, Ontario.  Although appearing as a compact [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]], the Tracker was actually certified as a [[Light truck]] due to its off-road capabilities.

The Geo Tracker was a [[mini SUV]] introduced in late 1988 as a 1989 model. It was developed by [[CAMI Automotive|CAMI]] which was a joint venture between General Motors of Canada and Suzuki. North American Models were to be built in CAMI's Ingersoll, Ontario, Canada plant alongside its almost identical twin the domestic-built [[Suzuki Sidekick]] (Escudo). All 1989 and some 1990 Trackers were built in Japan and imported to the US because of delays at the CAMI factory in Canada. In 1990, production began in Ingersoll and all Trackers were then being built there.

The Tracker was originally powered by Suzuki's 1.6L [[SOHC]] [[Straight-4|4-cylinder]] engine producing {{Convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The trim levels in 1989 were base convertible, base 2-door hardtop and LSi hardtop. LSi equipment included Air Conditioner, Chrome Rally Wheels, intermittent wipers, rear window wiper/washer, spare tire cover, 3-speed GM [[Turbo-Hydramatic 180]] automatic transmission, tinted glass, and special red/black front and rear bucket seats. In 1990 the LSi trim was made available on the convertible models also. All Trackers were four-wheel drive until a base two-wheel drive convertible was introduced in 1992. The two-door hardtop models were available until 1995 when they were discontinued to make way for the four-door hardtop wagon that was to be introduced the following year.   Although Suzuki started importing Sidekick 4-doors in 1991 CAMI didn't start producing them until the 1996 model year, when America got a 4-door Geo Tracker, now powered by Suzuki's G16B 16-valve 1.6L boasting {{Convert|96|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. In 1998 the Geo nameplate was merged back into Chevrolet and all Geo Models including the Tracker were rebadged as Chevrolet in 1998.

The Tracker was different from most other light SUVs on the market in that it is based on a rugged light-truck chassis and certified as a [[Light truck]].  Although it appeared to be a comfortable passenger SUV, it was bolstered by a sturdy off-road 4-wheel-drive system with a conventional light truck engine and transmission coupled to a hi-lo, 2-4 transfer case.  The Tracker had a strong front suspension with a rugged recirculating ball steering box.  The conventional front differential was rigidly mounted ahead of the engine, with CV axles connecting the coil-spring front hubs to the differential case.  The rear axle was a conventional light truck unit on coil springs.  As a result of the truck-like underpinnings, the Tracker had a fairly truck-like ride, but the benefit was its notable durability in harsh conditions.

The production of the first generation model of the Tracker (and Sidekick) came to an end in Ontario after 1998 in order to make way for the second generation of Tracker/Vitara.  However the first generation Sidekick continued in production in other countries until 2004.

When the Geo Tracker was introduced in the United States, the Geo brand was not being sold in Canada. Because of this the Tracker was introduced there as both the Chevrolet Tracker and the GMC Tracker. The Chevrolet Tracker was sold at Chevrolet dealerships in Canada starting in 1989.  Initially there were 3 models: a base convertible, base hardtop and a CL hardtop (CL is equivalent to the LSi in the Geo line). In 1990 a CL convertible was added to the line-up. 1991 was the last year for the Chevrolet Tracker as the Geo marque was brought to Canada in 1992 and all Chevrolet Trackers were renamed Geo Trackers, yet they continued to display the Chevrolet "Bow Tie" symbol on the front grille emblem until the end of production in 1998. All 1989–1990 Chevrolet Trackers were four-wheel drive. From 1991 on, the Geo Tracker sold in Canada was identical to its US counterpart. The GMC Tracker was also introduced for the 1989 model year to be sold at Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealerships in Canada.  Just like the Chevrolet and Geo initially there were three models: base convertible, base hardtop and SLE hardtop (SLE being equipped the same as the CL and LSi of the other marques). In 1990 an SLE convertible was added to the lineup. 1991 was the last year for the GMC Tracker as GM introduced the [[Asüna]] marque in 1992 and the GMC Tracker was renamed the [[Asüna]]  Sunrunner.  The Sunrunner was marketed as more upmarket and had no base model, with all of the Sunrunners being equipped like the SLEs were. The [[Asüna]] brand did not last long though and after only two years (1992 and 1993) the Sunrunner was rebranded as a Pontiac. The Pontiac Sunrunner was sold in Canada from 1994 to 1998 in both base and top of the line GT trim.  It was available in two- and four-wheel drive and in both convertible and hardtop body-styles.  While the Geo Tracker was also sold as a four-door wagon beginning in 1996, the Sunrunner never got this body style. The Sunrunner was discontinued in 2000 and was replaced by the [[Pontiac Aztek|Aztek]].

In 1999, the Sidekick was discontinued, and a second generation Tracker was introduced, differing from the Sidekick's successor, the Grand Vitara. A [[Suzuki]] version of this [[North America]]n-exclusive Tracker was sold in the [[North America]]n market as a '''Suzuki Vitara''', which is shorter than the [[Suzuki Escudo|Grand Vitara]]. In Mexico, the second-generation Tracker remained in production and was sold there as Chevrolet Tracker. The Tracker series was discontinued in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in 2004, but all models including the LJ80/Jimny are still in production in other [[Suzuki]] plants. Some Trackers and Sidekicks were made at a Suzuki plant in [[Kosai, Shizuoka|Kosai]], [[Japan]].

The later (1999 and up) Tracker models reverted to a lightweight automobile-type [[rack and pinion]] steering, and thus unpopular with rural and off-road users since the rack and pinion is easily damaged. The 1st generation Tracker was sold as the Chevrolet Vitara in Latin America, and the 2nd generation Tracker is sold as the Chevrolet Grand Vitara in Latin American countries. In North America, the first generation Tracker was sold as a [[Chevrolet]] in 1998 after GM discontinued the Geo brand. In Central America GM made the Suzuki Vitara/Grand Vitara and sold as Chevrolet Vitara/Grand Vitara  (Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela produced in GM Ecuador), Suzuki Grand Vitara (Argentina) Chevrolet Tracker (Brazil and Mexico) Both Produced by GM Argentina.
On January 27, 2004, production of the Chevrolet Tracker was discontinued at the CAMI plant in [[Ingersoll, Ontario]] and replaced with the [[Chevrolet Equinox]].

==Safety report==
According to a 1995 report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Status Report, Vol. 30, No. 9 |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|date=14 October 1995|url=http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr3009.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1991–1993 Two Wheel drive Geo Tracker had 21 driver fatalities for 66,210 registered vehicles, the highest incidence reported, at 3.2 per 10,000 vehicles.  The 4x4 version, however, reported 48 driver fatalities for 271,355 registered vehicles (1.8 per 10,000).  The IIHS states that the small utility class had a total of 366 driver fatalities for 2,144,891 total registered vehicles (1.6 per 10,000). This study was widely criticized for faulty comparisons.  For example, this study doesn't note the difference between 2-door models and 4-door models.  A later IIHS study clearly shows that, while 2-door Trackers have a slightly below-average injury rate, the 4-door models are ''better'' than the average for utility vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Injury, Collision, and Theft Losses |publisher=Highway Loss Data Institute|date=21 September 2000|url=http://www.carsafety.org/research/hldi/ictl_pdf/ictl_0901.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corvair Fitch Sprint''' was a set of modifications for the [[Chevrolet Corvair]] automobile developed by racing driver [[John Fitch (racing driver)|John Fitch]].

John Fitch was given the opportunity to test several models of the brand new Corvair during the fall of 1959. He had the cars for two weeks and tested them at the Lime Rock track in Connecticut. During this pre-public tryout, John left enthused with the Corvairs potential as a Grand touring machine with a European flavor. He then set out to develop various engine, chassis and body modifications. John decided to market these modifications and the Fitch Sprint was born. John’s first Corvair was a 1961 Monza Coupé. John used this car as the basis to build the first prototype Sprint. Fitch Sprints were available in three different flavors. A customer could have his new Corvair drop shipped to Fitch’s [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] shop and have Fitch’s mechanics install the Sprint kit options desired. Or, the Sprint kit could be installed by a local Chevrolet dealer who is authorized by Fitch to install the Sprint kit. Fitch recalls that more cars were converted at dealerships than at his shop. And lastly and most popular, you could mail-order the kit and options you desire and install the Sprint kit yourself. Fitch continued producing Sprints until GM pulled the plug and later sold all inventory and tooling for the Sprint to Art Hershberger of Solar Automotive in November 1971.

==Fitch Sprint Options==

Options are broken down approximately by year introduced, but be aware that there is some overlap across years. Fitch produced these parts over approximately a ten-year period from 1961 to 1971 until he sold all rights, parts and toolings to Art Hershberger of Solar Automotive. So any year Corvair could have any of the following options that were not early or late model specific.

Notable exceptions:

Full width stone guard					        Early models only	

Black vinyl top							Early models only

Chrome bow at top of back window				Early models only

Masked rear window 						Early models only

S P R I N T letters						Early models only

Custom rear coil springs  providing 2 deg. neg. camber	        Early models only

Matching colored vinyl covered glove box door		        Early models only

Hydraulic steering damper (Mercedes type)			Early models only

SPRINT by Fitch emblem (large)				        Not used on late venttops

Sprint fastback 904 venttop					Late models only

Aeon rubber spring bumper blocks				Late model only

Hydraulic steering damper (Delco Stingray type)		        Late models only

== 1961 Sprint (Fitch Prototype) ==

*Prototype 98 bhp w/ 4 speed trans.

*Racing stripes: Runs down front fender seams, half on trunk lid and half on fender top for the driver to use as visual reference of lateral movement between car and road, and rear stripes placed inboard of rear fender seams and on engine lid

*Radson tachometer: Tach  mounts underneath cowl, partially blocking the lower speeds on regular instrument cluster, or on top of dash by ashtray.

*Wood rimmed steering wheel: Provides a better grip due to thicker ring, with a better dish than stock, (made by the Wilhelm B. Hahn Company), with SPRINT horn button emblem mounted in stock 62 Monza horn ring cap

*Helphos windshield-mounted spotlight

*Compass

*S P R I N T letters: Located on dashboard and front trunk lid in chrome

*Custom rear coil springs  providing 2 deg. neg. camber: Provided at rear wheels by Fitch custom rear coil springs with a higher spring rate and shorter height.

*Tuned length dual muffler: Trombone shape glass pack style mufflers provide enough length for mellow exhaust sound with a free flowing exhaust. Also known as Exhaust extractors.

'''4-carburetor specially tuned engine:''' 155 bhp was 110bhp. Cylinder heads were reworked to add one carb pad per head to produce a four carburetor setup.

'''Fitch metallic lined brake shoes:''' Reduces fade, improves braking.

'''Pirelli tires:''' Replaces factory tires and now used instead of Michelin X.

'''Brazilian rosewood gear shift knob:''' Attractive rosewood shift knob with three dimensional embossed Sprint checkerboard insignia.

'''Racing stripe:''' Stripe continues down trunk lid and fills entire area between headlights. Stripes are also painted inside trunk lid gasket area.

'''Wood rimmed steering wheel:''' Provides a better grip due to thicker rim, with a better dish than stock. With SPRINT horn button, now uses 1963 "700" style horn button with sprint insert. Several different styles of  wood wheels have been available through Fitch over the years.

'''SPRINT by Fitch emblem:''' Replaces chrome SPRINT letters on trunk and dash with SPRINT by Fitch emblems on the front fenders above and in front of the wheel well openings and on the rear body panel
(C O R V A I R letters now occupy space where SPRINT was written). Uses large size SPRINT emblem with studs (SPRINT emblems were often mounted in other places on the car. The emblem replaces the Corvair script on the front panel of a 1963 Corvair).

== Second generation late model Sprints 1965-1969 ==
	  
===1965 Sprint===

'''Four individual small air breathers:''' Replaces stock setup with altered crankcase breather hose re-routed into a single air cleaner (different style air cleaners were available over the years).
	 
'''Sprint fastback 904 venttop:''' A large fiberglass roof attachment, which gives the late model Corvair coupé a fastback appearance (not available for convertible or sedan).
	 
'''Pair of adjustable Gabriel shocks:''' Replaces stock rear shocks for better handling.

'''Leather wrapped steering wheel:''' Attractive leather steering wheel wrap often used if wood wheel option is not ordered. Can be used with wood wheel if desired.

'''Rear seat sound insulation:''' Double layer of foam insulation added under the rear seat to reduce road noise in passenger compartment.

'''Judson electronic magneto:''' Provides for longer spark plug and point life, hotter spark, and longer mileage between routine tuning. Early precursor to an electronic ignition system.
 
'''Tuned length dual muffler:''' Trombone shape glass pack style mufflers providing enough length for mellow exhaust sound with a free flowing exhaust. Also known as exhaust extractors.

'''Michelin X or Pirelli tires:''' Choice is offered. Exchanged for factory tires.

'''Fog-Cote yellow dye:''' Attractive painted yellow dye applied to the outboard lowbeams to work better in fog conditions.

'''Aeon progressive-rate auxiliary rubber spring bumpers:''' These mounted on the spring rebound pad in the rear and on the shock absorber stem in the front. Improves the car's handling.
	 
'''Indicaps:''' Replaces valve stem caps. Preset to tire pressures 18, 20, 26, 28, or 30 lb.

'''Seat tilt mechanism:''' This option was not offered for late models, but may possibly be adapted to lates.

'''Adjustable headrests:''' Round headrests that attach to seat backs via thumbscrews and brackets. Available for driver side and passenger side (1966 and prior only, without factory headrests).

'''Blaupunkt AM-FM radio:''' Installed in place of stock AM radio.

'''Lucas Flamethrower:''' 1/4 mile pencil beam high beam light replaced left side high beam.
 
'''Grab rail:''' Mounted above glove box door sticking straight out. This contrasts with the early model which is mounted under glove box pointing down.

'''Fold down rear seat and rear luggage deck compartment carpet:''' Improves appearance and helps prevent luggage from sliding around.

'''Fast ratio steering arms:''' Three turns lock-to-lock (without reducing turning radius). Stock steering arms are modified by cutting and rewelding into shortened arms. The arms are then magnafluxed and painted blue.

'''Short throw gearshift assembly:''' Reduces shift travel to give a sportscar-like feel.'''

'''Tall drivers seat bracket:''' Allows drivers with long legs to sit comfortably, or to allow the passenger to stretch their legs.

'''Gear shift boot (black):''' Replaces stock shift boot when quick shift kit is used.

'''Hydraulic steering damper:''' (Delco Stingray type) To eliminate road shock. 
	 
'''Heel-and-toe bracket:''' Attaches to accelerator pedal for proper racing style shifts (hooks on accelerator pedal and allows driver to have his toes on brake pedal and his heel on the accelerator pedal to keep engine revs up while braking and down shifting).

'''Head light high beam flasher switch:''' Mounts to the right of wheel above radio (silver rod with black tip), longer than early model flasher. Used to blink lights to signal approach where horn would not be heard because of distance and speed (mounting location listed was usual location but could be placed anywhere according to owner preference).
		 
'''Fitch metallic lined brake shoes:''' Reduces fade, improves braking.

'''Essential light monitor:''' Precision instrument protects you by monitoring your running lights and advising you if they cease to function correctly.

'''One-time windshield wiper switch:''' Switch stem at your fingertips clears the glass with one sweep.

'''Brazilian rosewood gear shift knob:''' Attractive rosewood shift knob with three dimensional embossed Sprint checkerboard insignia.

'''Racing stripe:''' Available in vinyl as a kit.

'''Paint, top only:''' Hood painted black satin acrylic lacquer. Available at John Fitch and Co. only.

'''Paint, roof only:''' Roof painted black satin acrylic lacquer. Available at John Fitch and Co. only.

'''SPRINT by Fitch emblem (small):''' Replaces large SPRINT by Fitch emblems. Smaller emblem designed to fit and work correctly on new Venttop offered for late models. Larger emblem was still used on the rear hood in place of HP emblem until supplies ran out and was replaced with the small emblem (i.e. both small and large SPRINT emblems may be found on rear hood on late models). Also, smaller SPRINT emblems were used as replacements on early models.
 
'''13-inch Hands aluminum mag wheels:''' 5-lug, 8-slot mags w/3-prong spinner for 65 and later (few were so equipped due to the scarcity of these wheels. Fitch himself could not locate a set for his Phoenix). 
		    
* Hands wheels for earlies were not available until 1965, so Sprints built before that time were not originally equipped with these wheels. Owners opted to add these wheels later.

'''Tachometer: For Monza and “500” models only:''' (Corsas already have a tach). All transistorized and self-contained. Custom made to mount in the center hole in the Monza and “500” dash.

'''Wood rimmed steering wheel:''' Provides a better grip due to thicker rim, with a better dish than stock. With SPRINT horn button, now uses 1963 "700" style horn button with sprint insert. Several different styles of wood wheels have been available through Fitch over the years. Not available for cars with factory wood wheel or telescopic column.

=== 1966-69 S P R I N T Added options ===

'''Koni shocks:''' These adjustable shocks are mounted at front and rear. An upgrade from the Gabriel shocks.

'''Englebert Rallye 220 steel belted radial with tubes:''' Exchanged for factory tires (FYI: Fitch continually upgraded the tires he offered. Fitch first offered Michelin X tires followed by Pirelli tires in 1964 and the tires listed above for the 66 and later brochures).

'''Forced air-ventilated bucket seat:''' This option was not listed in any brochure but has been seen listed in a road test of a 1966 Sprint. The test also featured a picture which clearly shows the front bucket with the ventilation holes in the front seat upholstery.

&lt;ref&gt;1963 Sprint Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Light Six''' Series L was an American car produced by [[Chevrolet]] in 1914 and 1915. The famous Chevrolet 'Bow Tie' emblem made its grand debut in 1914, and has been used on all Chevrolet cars and trucks since then. 
When the [[Chevrolet Series C Classic Six|Classic Six]] ceased production at the end of the 1914 model year the '''Light Six''' replaced it in 1915 as Chevrolet's top-of-the-line car.

==Features==
[[File:Light Six Engine.jpg|thumb|left|1914 Chevrolet Light Six Engine Compartment]]
The L Series used a Sterling six-cylinder L-head engine rated at 35&amp;nbsp;bhp and was offered with an Auto-lite electric starter. A cone style clutch was mounted to the engine with a drive shaft that was connected to a rear end mounted selective sliding 3 speed transmission. The car used a 3/4 floating type rear suspension with 34 x 4 inch tires.

Unlike the lower priced [[Chevrolet Series H|H Series]] which was available in two body styles (Royal Mail Roadster $750) and the (Baby Grand Touring $875) the L Series was only available as a 5-passenger four-door Touring car and cost $1,475.

Available body colors were Chevrolet (bow tie) Blue or Gunmetal Grey. The hood, radiator and fenders were all painted black. The Chassis and wheels were bow tie blue. Also included was Light grey pin striping on the wheel spokes and hood vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/z18634/chevrolet-series-l.aspx|title=1914 Chevrolet Series L|last=Vaughan|first=Daniel|date=August 2010|website=conceptcarz|url-status=live|access-date=December 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet, 1912-2003: 90 Years of History, Photos, Technical Data, and Pricing|last=Gunnell|first=John|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1440230516|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production Notes==
Series L production ran from 1914 through 1915. Chevrolet Motor Company records indicate a grand total of approx. 1000 were made for both years.

==Surviving Example==
The one and only known surviving Light Six (shown here) is a 1914 model owned by a long time member of the VCCA (Vintage Chevrolet Club of America) in which he is known as "Mr. Chevrolet". He spent many years looking for one these cars and found this one in Massachusetts in 1984, then painstakingly restored it back to its former glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.houghtonlakeresorter.com/articles/randalls-light-six-continues-his-love-of-all-things-chevy/|title=Randall’s ‘Light Six’ continues his love of all things Chevy|last=Holladay|first=Cheryl|date=September 27, 2012|website=The Houghton Lake Resorter|url-status=live|access-date=December 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Development ===
GM Korea began developing the Bolt in 2012 with a team of 180 people,&lt;ref name=Courtenay&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wardsauto.com/technology/bolt-s-lead-designer-describes-clean-sheet-creation |title= Bolt's Lead Designer Describes Clean-Sheet Creation |first= Vince |last= Courtenay |website= wardsauto.com |date=April 26, 2017 |accessdate=May 18, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170426124215/http://wardsauto.com/technology/bolt-s-lead-designer-describes-clean-sheet-creation |archive-date=April 26, 2017 |url-status= live |quote= Stuart Norris .. arrived in Korea in the fall of 2012 to start laying the groundwork for the Bolt's design }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with its initial [[concept car|concept]] debuting at the [[North American International Auto Show#2015|2015 North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref name=AB01122015&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2015/01/12/chevrolet-bolt-ev-concept-video-detroit-2015/ |title=Chevrolet Bolt EV Concept foreshadows an affordable, 200-mile EV future [w/videos] |first=Brandon |last=Turkus |website=Autoblog.com |date=January 12, 2015 |accessdate=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bolt EV lateral 2015 NAIAS.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Bolt EV [[concept car|concept]] at the 2015 [[North American International Auto Show]]]]

{{As of|2015|06}}, General Motors had tested more than 50 Bolt [[prototype]]s hand-built at the [[General Motors Proving Grounds]] in [[Milford, Michigan]]. The cars were tested at the proving grounds and overseas locations for ride and handling dynamics, cabin comfort, quietness, charging capability, and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/06/24/chevy-bolt-testing-video/|title=Chevy ramps up development of Bolt EV|author=Greg Migliore|website=Autoblog.com |date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Batey, head of General Motors North America, announced in February 2015 that the Bolt EV was headed for production, and would be available in all 50 states.&lt;ref name=LAT01122015/&gt; GM also has plans to sell the Bolt in select global markets.&lt;ref name=2016CES&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2015/11/19/chevy-bolt-ev-revealed-january-ces/76067870/ |title=Chevy Bolt EV to be revealed in January at CES|author=Henry Payne |newspaper=[[The Detroit News]]|date=November 19, 2015 |accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas, the production version of the Chevrolet Bolt was unveiled. At the show, during GM CEO [[Mary Barra]]'s keynote, Chevrolet confirmed an estimated range of {{convert|200|mi|abbr=out}} or more, around {{USD|30,000}} price after government incentives, and stated it would be available in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mychevybolt.com/chevrolet-bolt-unveiled-at-ces-today-details-leaked-ahead-of-schedule-videos-of-test-drives-etc/|title=Chevrolet Bolt unveiled at CES Today|author=Mike Szostech|date=January 6, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barra projected in February 2016 that the European version, marketed as the Opel Ampera-e (or Vauxhall Ampera-e in the United Kingdom), would enter production in 2017.&lt;ref name=Ampera_e&gt;{{cite news|url= http://fortune.com/2016/02/11/gm-chevy-bolt-opel-ampera-e/| title=GM Unveils an All-Electric Car for Europe |first=Kirsten |last=Korosec |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, GM released photos and a short pre-production video of the Bolt at the company's Orion Assembly plant outside Detroit, testing manufacturing and tooling.&lt;ref name="preproduction-engadget"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/22/chevy-is-getting-the-bolt-ev-ready-for-production/ |title=Chevy is getting the Bolt EV ready for production|first=Roberto|last=Baldwin |website=[[Engadget]] |date=March 22, 2016 |accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifications ==

=== Battery ===

The Bolt's battery uses "nickel-rich lithium-ion" chemistry, allowing the cells to run at higher temperatures than those in GM's previous electric vehicles, allowing a simpler{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and cheaper{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} [[liquid cooling]] system for the {{cvt|60|kWh}} battery pack. The battery pack is a [[Stressed member engine|stressed member]]&lt;!--no better wl found--&gt; and weighs {{cvt|960|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/trickle-charged-chevrolet-reveals-more-details-about-bolts-electric-drivetrain/ |title=Trickle Charged: GM Releases More Chevrolet Bolt EV Details |publisher=|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It accounts for 23% of the car's value,&lt;ref name=CDpreview/&gt; and is composed of 288 flat "landscape" format cells. Cells are bundled into groups of three connected in parallel, and 96 groups connected in series compose the pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/chevy-bolt-evs-battery-is-as-big-as-a-teslas/ |title=Chevy Bolt EV's Battery Is As Big As A Tesla's|author=Jeff Cobb |website=HybridCars.com |date=January 11, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery is rated at 160&amp;nbsp;kW power to avoid limiting the 150&amp;nbsp;kW/340 Nm motor. GM offers a battery warranty of 8 years / {{convert|100,000|mi|abbr=out}},&lt;!--and/or?--&gt; and has no plans for other battery sizes.

The 2020 model year will have the battery capacity increased to 66 kWh, because of a small change made to the battery chemistry, that increases the EPA rated range by {{convert|21|miles|km|0|abbr=out}}.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

=== Drivetrain ===

Other specifications include a {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|266|lb.ft|Nm|abbr=on}} Interior Permanent Magnet electric motor, acceleration from {{convert|0|-|30|mph|abbr=on}} in 2.9 seconds and {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on}} in less than 7 seconds, and a top speed of {{convert|91|mph|abbr=on}}. The electric motor is integrated with a single-speed transmission and differential, to form a single modular drive unit that connects directly to the front axles.  The single-speed transmission has a [[final drive ratio]] of 7.05:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/bolt-ev/2017.tab1.html|title=2017 CHEVROLET BOLT EV SPECIFICATIONS|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.motortrend.com/cars/chevrolet/volt/2016/2017-chevrolet-bolt-ev-drivetrain-first-look-review/ |title=2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Drivetrain First Look (w/Video) - Motor Trend|date=April 6, 2016 |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |access-date=March 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.myelectriccarforums.com/chevrolet-bolt-ev-full-specs-released-at-naias-this-morning/ |title=Chevrolet Bolt EV Full Specs Released at NAIAS this morning|author=Mike Szostech|date=January 11, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2016/01/11/2017-chevy-bolt-detroit-2016/ |title=More 2017 Chevy Bolt powertrain details revealed|author=Sebastian Blanco |website=Autoblog |date=January 11, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body and chassis ===

The Bolt EV is tall hatchback design, with a curb weight of 3,580&amp;nbsp;pounds (1,625&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/bolt-ev/2017.tab1.html Chevrolet spec sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite its overall height of nearly 63&amp;nbsp;inches (1.6&amp;nbsp;meters), the center of gravity is under 21&amp;nbsp;inches (53&amp;nbsp;cm) above the ground, yielding surprisingly stable handling during cornering.  The low center of gravity is due to under-floor mounting of the battery pack, following the lead of [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]]'s [[Tesla Model S|Model S]].

Bolt uses the now-common [[kammback]]/hatchback low-drag body design, with sweeping curves leading to an abrupt back end.  It was initially reported to have a {{Cd|link=car|long=yes|0.32}}&lt;ref name="norris2016-08"/&gt; but GM says the final production vehicle has {{Cd|0.308}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.hybridcars.com/2017-chevy-bolt-ev-is-less-of-a-drag-than-originally-believed/ |title=2017 Chevy Bolt EV Is Less of a Drag Than Originally Believed |date=January 29, 2017 |website=HybridCars.com |access-date=March 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Range and efficiency ===

Under the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) five-cycle test methodology, the Bolt fuel economy is rated at 119 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (mpg-e) ({{convert|119|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on|disp=out|1}}) for combined driving, 128 mpg-e ({{convert|128|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on|disp=out|1}}) in city and 110 mpg-e ({{convert|110|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on|disp=out|1}}) in highway.&lt;ref name=EPABolt2017/&gt; Charging time is rated at 9.3 hours on a [[Charging station#Standards|Level 2 fast charger]].&lt;ref name=EPAratings&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-bolt-ev-range-20160912-snap-story.html | title=Chevy Bolt EV range is 238 miles: Prime time for the electric car? | first=Charles | last=Fleming | newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=September 12, 2016 | accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charging ===

All models of Bolt support standard [[SAE International|SAE]] EV charging plugs, at Level 1 or Level 2 (AC).  A factory option supports Level 3 (rapid DC) charging with the [[Combined Charging System|SAE Combo DC]] system.  A portable Level 1 charging adapter is supplied with each Bolt, stowed in a special compartment under the hatchback floor.  It is UL Listed to operate at 120vac in the US market but is capable of operating at 240 VAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://imgur.com/gallery/vFkP5 |title=Stock 2016 Chevy Volt EVSE running on 240VAC |website=Imgur |date=January 8, 2016 |access-date=July 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Level 1 (110VAC) charging supplies roughly 1&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;ref name="tu2016-11-23"/&gt; and adds 3–5&amp;nbsp;miles (5–8&amp;nbsp;km) of range per hour of charging.  Level 2 (240VAC) charging supplies up to 7.2&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;ref name="tu2016-11-23"/&gt; and adds 20–30&amp;nbsp;miles (30–50&amp;nbsp;km) of range per hour of charging.

=== Tires ===

The Bolt EV is delivered with self-sealing tires whose interior surfaces are coated with a sticky compound to automatically seal small leaks and punctures in the tread area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://my.chevrolet.com/content/dam/gmownercenter/gmna/dynamic/manuals/2017/Chevrolet/BOLT%20EV/Owner%27s%20Manual.pdf Chevrolet Bolt 2017 Owners' Manual, p. 271]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no spare tire, nor is there (officially) a place to store one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://my.chevrolet.com/content/dam/gmownercenter/gmna/dynamic/manuals/2017/Chevrolet/BOLT%20EV/Owner%27s%20Manual.pdf Chevrolet Bolt 2017 Owners' Manual, p. 272]&lt;/ref&gt; The car is equipped with a digital [[Tire Pressure Monitoring System]] to warn the driver if a tire is leaking, and a portable air compressor kit is supplied as a standard part.  Under the rear hatchback cargo deck, there is a space that can be used to store an undersized spare, and some owners carry a compatible [[Chevrolet Cruze|Chevy Cruze]] spare tire there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chevybolt.org/forum/12-wheels-tires-brakes-suspension/6025-bolt-spare-tire-options.html 2017 Discussion and photos on the chevybolt.org Chevy Bolt EV Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== European discontinuation controversy ==

In October 2017, European dealers were asked to completely stop accepting orders for the Ampera-e (known as the Chevy Bolt in the USA), reportedly because of supply problems, at the point when in the nation of Norway (which has a population of only 5.2 million, smaller than Minnesota's) 4,000-5,000 people had already ordered the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://insideevs.com/opel-tells-norwegian-dealers-cease-orders-ampera-e-demand-far-exceeds-supply |title=Opel To Dealers: Stop Selling The Ampera-E, We Have Too Many Orders |first=Mark |last=Kane |work=Inside EVs |location=US |date=October 21, 2017 |access-date=July 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://electrek.co/2017/10/20/chevy-bolt-ev-opel-norwegian-dealers-stop-taking-orders/ |title=Opel asks Norwegian dealers to stop taking orders for Bolt EVs (Ampera E) as supply can't match demand |first=Fred |last=Lambert |work=Electrek |location=US |date=October 20, 2017 |access-date=July 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Bolt was offered for sale in Norway at a price of $35,000, not significantly higher than that of the Nissan Leaf, despite both its range and battery capacity being at least 50% higher than the Leaf's.

The fact that GM was limiting deliveries of the Bolt to Norway, its most promising market, in 2017 led to suspicions that it's going to "kill" the model in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://transportevolved.com/2017/11/08/is-gm-trying-to-kill-the-opel-ampera-e-electric-car-in-europe-the-signs-arent-good |title=Is GM Trying To Kill The Opel Ampera-E Electric Car in Europe?

GM has been accused of purposefully sabotaging its own EV programme in the past.

In 2018, it was virtually impossible to order the car in Europe (though in November 2018, it was reported to be on sale in the Netherlands at a price of $53,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://elektrowoz.pl/auta/opel-ampera-e-w-holandii-znowu-w-sprzedazy-cena-od-rownowartosci-201-tysiecy-zlotych |title=Opel Ampera-e w Holandii znowu w sprzedaży.

In late 2018, about a year after Norwegians were prevented from ordering more Bolts, a close competitor, the [[Hyundai Kona]] EV (with a 64 kWh battery), was offered for sale there. The entire yearly allotment of the cars was sold out almost instantly.

== Pre-production name confusion ==
[[File:Chevrolet Bolt EV SAO 2016 8865.jpg|thumb|2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV badge.]]

In 2015, Chevrolet acknowledged confusion between two vehicles with a similar-sounding names; ''Bolt'' and ''Volt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/02/20/chevy-bolt-volt-name-confusion/|title=Chevy admits there's confusion over Bolt and Volt names |website=Autoblog |author=Sebastian Blanco|date=February 20, 2015|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrolet's marketing chief, Tim Mahoney, subsequently announced GM would keep the ''Bolt'' name.&lt;ref name=Bolt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/04/15/bolt-volt-chevrolet-name-mahoney-electric/25813977/?siteID=je6NUbpObpQ-n_zGUeSLMT8TT_MIvAnZCA|title='Bolt' name is a keeper, says Chevy marketing boss |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |author=James R. Healey|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Autoblog]]'' projected similar confusion among European customers where the Opel Ampera-e (the Bolt variant) is just one letter off from the [[Opel Ampera]], the previous-generation [[Chevrolet Volt]] sold in Europe—suggesting the names could confuse customers who think the new all-electric hatchback is closely related to the old plug-in hybrid hatchback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.autoblog.com/2016/02/12/opel-ampera-e-chevy-bolt-europe/#slide-3796659 |title= Opel Ampera-e brings a Bolt of EV driving to Europe |first= Chris |last= Bruce |website=Autoblog.com |date=February 12, 2016 |accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tata Motors]] has had a car named the [[Tata Bolt|Bolt]] on the market since 2014, and has registered the trademark in India and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |magazine=[[Car and Driver]] |url = https://blog.caranddriver.com/two-bolts-chevy-concept-shares-name-with-tata-subcompact/ |title=

The '''Chevrolet Series D''' is an American automobile produced by [[Chevrolet]] between 1917 and 1918. Over 4,000 Series D cars were manufactured in the 1918 model year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=75 Years of Chevrolet |url=http://www.gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1918-Chevrolet.pdf |work=GM Heritage Archive |accessdate=19 June 2012 |page=21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501213736/http://gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1918-Chevrolet.pdf |archivedate=May 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the first Chevrolet V8 car made. It was not until 1955 that Chevrolet made another V8.

==Models==
The series came in two body styles, a 4-door Touring and a 2-door Chummy Roadster.

==Details==
The Chevrolet Series D V8 [[internal combustion engine]] is a liquid-cooled, {{convert|288|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} capacity, designed and built by Chevrolet in 1917 and subsequently by [[General Motors]] Company's new Chevrolet Division (acquired as part of [[Chevrolet]]'s 1917 takeover of, and merger into, GM) in 1917 and 1918.

It is capable of producing {{convert|36|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 2700&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1917 Chevrolet Series D Engine|url=http://www.gmphotostore.com/1917-Chevrolet-Series-D-Engine/productinfo/53216861/|work=GM Photo Store|accessdate=19 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106205646/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1917-Chevrolet-Series-D-Engine/productinfo/53216861/|archive-date=6 January 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was Chevrolet's first V8 and one of the first [[overhead-valve]] V8 engines. Chevrolet would not produce another V8 until the debut of the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Generation I small-block]] in 1955. This design had a partially exposed valvetrain (pushrods and lifters were visible) with a nickel-plated rocker cover, an aluminum water-cooled intake manifold. The starter is in the valley of the block, as well as the gear driven generator with the fan clutch coming off of it. The gear driven generator runs the distributor as well. The belt in the front drove only the water pump. It had a {{convert|50|lb|abbr=on}} flywheel and a counterbalanced crankshaft.

The 1917 Chevrolet Series D V8 Touring, with a {{convert|120|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase, did not sell well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=87 Year Old Chevy V-8! |url=http://www.motorburg.com/?p=482%20Motor%20Burg |work=Motorburg |accessdate=19 June 2012 |date=19 July 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222180413/http://www.motorburg.com/?p=482%20Motor%20Burg |archivedate=December 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the 1917 Series D was listed 11th in the Worst Cars of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Worst Cars of All Time|url=http://www.insideline.com/features/100-worst-cars-of-all-time.html|work=Edmunds Inside Line|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1957 Chevrolet BelAir, AM-93-38 p4.jpg|thumb|1957 Chevrolet Bel Air]]
In automobile parlance, '''Tri-Five''' refers to the 1955, 1956 and 1957 [[Chevrolet]] automobiles, in particular, the 150, 210, [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]], and [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]].{{r|Breitenstein2004}}  Revolutionary in their day, they spawned a cult following that exists in clubs, websites and even entire businesses that exclusively cater to the enthusiasts of the Tri Five automobiles. All featured a [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]].  They remain some of the most popular years for collectors and hot rodders.{{r|Richardson1998}}{{sfnp|Genat|Newhardt|2008|p=40}}

==Background==
One of the most influential elements of the Tri-Five was the recent development of their newest [[Chevrolet small-block engine#265|265]] [[Cubic inch|cid]] (4,340 cc) [[V8 engine]], which was first offered in 1955.&lt;ref name="Dennis Adler 1996. p77"&gt;Dennis Adler (1996). p77&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an [[overhead valve]] high compression, short [[stroke (engine)|stroke]] design that remained in production in various forms for decades. The base V8 had a two-barrel [[carburetor]] and was rated at {{convert|162|hp}}, and the "Power Pack" option featured a four-barrel carburetor and other upgrades yielding {{convert|180|bhp}}. Later, a "Super Power Pack" option added high compression and a further {{convert|15|bhp}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Brochure_1/1957%20Chevrolet%20Brochure-07.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet/1957_Chevrolet_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

1955-1957 were watershed years for Chevrolet, who spent a million dollars in 1956 alone for retooling, in order to make their less expensive Bel Air models look more like a Cadillac, culminating in 1957 with their most extravagant [[Car tailfin|tailfin]]s and Cadillac inspired bumper guards.&lt;ref name="Dennis Adler 1996. p77"/&gt;

In 1955, Americans purchased 7.1 million new automobiles, including 1.7 million Chevrolets, giving the company fully 44% of the low-price market&lt;ref&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.24&lt;/ref&gt; and surpassing Ford in total unit sales by 250,000.&lt;ref name="Consumer Guide 2007 p.56"&gt;Consumer Guide (2007) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The Bel Air was an instant hit with consumers, with Base One-Fifty models starting under $1600 and featuring a [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine|six cylinder engine]].&lt;ref name="David Newhardt 2008 p.22"&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the new optional 162 [[horsepower]] Chevrolet 265cid V8, coupled with the [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] quickly earned the model the nickname "The Hot One".  In the first year of production, the oil filter was considered an option, although not having it led to significantly shorter engine life.&lt;ref name="David Newhardt 2008 p.22"/&gt;

1955 also saw the introduction of the [[Chevrolet Nomad]].  Introduced mid-year, somewhere between 6103&lt;ref name="David Newhardt 2008 p.28"&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.28&lt;/ref&gt; and 7886&lt;ref name="Consumer Guide 2007 p.56"/&gt; were produced in 1955, making them more rare.  It was available only in the Bel Air trim with the V8 as standard equipment.  Priced at $2571, it was at the higher end of the Chevrolet pricing scale but came standard with plush carpeting, two-toned paint, headliner trim and other features that separated it from the most basic 150 Series Chevrolets.&lt;ref name="David Newhardt 2008 p.28"/&gt;

1956 was basically a carry over model, with minor changes to the grill, trim and other accessories.  It meant huge gains in sales for Chevrolet, who sold 104,849 Bel Air models, due in part to the new V8 engine introduced a year before.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.34&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time, their 265cid V8 had gained popularity with [[hot rod]]ders who found the engine easy to modify for horsepower gains.  This wasn't lost on Chevrolet's [[engineer]]s, who managed to up the horsepower in 1956 from 162&amp;nbsp;hp to 225&amp;nbsp;hp with optional add-ons.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  For 1956 the 265 cid V8 engine was modified to include an integral oil filter, with a range of power choices from 162 HP for the base V8 up to 240 HP for R.P.O. 411 "Super Power Pack" offered mid-year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trifive.com/garage/56%20Chevy%20Assembly%20Manual/410-1.gif |title=Sheet 1.00 |publisher=Chevrolet |accessdate=8 September 2018 |work=1956 Passenger Assembly Instruction Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jalopyjournal.com/forum/threads/265-cu-in-240-hp.1013400/ |title=265 CU.

The average two door Bel Air in 1956 sold for $2100, which was considered a good value at the time.  Prices ranging from $1665 for the 150 sedan with six cylinder engine to $2443 for the V8 equipped convertible, with Nomad models running slightly higher.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.33-38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] broke the time record ascending [[Pikes Peak]] in a pre-production 1956 Bel Air equipped with the 265 V8 engine in just 17 minutes and 24.05 seconds, shattering the previous record of 19 minutes 25.70 seconds, set 21 years before.&lt;ref name="Dennis Adler 1996. p78"&gt;Dennis Adler (1996). p78&lt;/ref&gt;

The last of the Tri-Five Chevrolets introduced several changes, including the large tailfins, "twin rocket" hood design, even more chrome, tri-color paint and a choice from no less than seven different V8 engines.&lt;ref name="Dennis Adler 1996. p78"/&gt;  While in 1957,  Ford outsold Chevrolet for the first time in a great while, years later the used 1957 Chevrolets would sell for hundreds more than their Ford counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.44&lt;/ref&gt;  As the horsepower race continued, Chevrolet introduced a new version of their small block, with 283 cubic inches of displacement and 245 horsepower. They also introduced a limited number of Rochester fuel injected 283 engines that produced 283 horsepower, the first production engine to achieve 1 horsepower per cubic inch.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Guide (2007) p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  For all intent and purposes, this made the 1957 Bel Air a "hot rod", right off the production line.&lt;ref name="Dennis Adler 1996. p78"/&gt; It was available with manual transmission only.  The base 265cid engine saw an increase from 170 to 185 horsepower as well.   While not as popular as the previous year's offering, Chevrolet still managed to sell 1.5 million cars in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Genat and David Newhardt (2008). p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt;  Even now, the 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air is one of the most sought after collector cars ever produced.&lt;ref name="Dennis Adler 1996. p78"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Although considered classics, the Tri-Five in recent years have been seen as among the most dangerous vehicles to drive, especially in comparison to modern vehicles. In 2009, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] released a crash-test video between a 1959 Bel Air (though not a Tri-Five model) and a 2009 [[Chevrolet Malibu]] in a head-on collision. The Bel Air scored a "Poor" rating in every category and collapsed internally in comparison to the Malibu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/g2005/22-brutal-crash-tests-video/?slide=1|title=22 Brutal Crash Tests That Changed The Way Cars Are Built|author=Ben Stewart|date=May 6, 2015|website=[[Popular Mechanics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Car and Driver]] wrote a piece detailing what would make the Tri-Five unsafe even for its day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/the-many-ways-in-which-cars-were-stupendously-unsafe-60-years-ago|title=The Many Ways in Which Cars Were Stupendously Unsafe 60 Years Ago|author=John Pearley Huffman|date=December 5, 2017|website=[[Car and Driver]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Corvair''' is a [[compact car]] manufactured by [[Chevrolet]] for [[model year]]s 1960–1969 in two generations. It is still the only American-designed, mass-produced passenger car with a [[Rear-engine design|rear-mounted]], [[air-cooled engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://axleaddict.com/cars/The-Rear-Engine--Air-Cooled-1965-69-Chevrolet-CorvairThe Rear-Engine, Air-Cooled 1965–69 Chevrolet Corvair – AxleAddict]&lt;/ref&gt; The Corvair was manufactured and marketed in 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe, convertible, 4-door station wagon, passenger van, commercial van, and pickup truck body styles in its first generation (1960–1964) as well as 2-door coupe, convertible and 4-door sedan in its second (1965–1969).

==History==
In 1952, [[Ed Cole]] was promoted to chief engineer of the Chevrolet Motor Division. Four years later, in July 1956, he was named General Manager of Chevrolet (GM's largest automotive division) and became a vice president of General Motors. At Chevrolet, Cole pushed for many of the major engineering and design advancements introduced in the Chevrolet car and truck lines between 1955 and 1962. He was completely involved in the development and production of the air-cooled rear-engine Corvair. The Corvair was a ground-breaking car in its day. As chief engineer, Cole was also heavily involved in the development of the Corvette sports car. He is also known as the "father" of the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|small-block Chevy V8]], one of the most celebrated engines in American automotive history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Cole,_Edward_N. |title=Edward N.

Until 1960, the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] American domestic auto manufacturers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) produced only one size of passenger car. A successful modern "[[compact car]]" [[Market segmentation|market segment]] was established in the U.S. by the 1950 [[Nash Rambler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=1 |year=2005 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |isbn=978-1-59339-236-9 |page=333 |quote=first modern American compact car, the Rambler. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Detroit became the automotive capital: 100th anniversary |first=Robert G. |last=Szudarek |year=1996 |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |isbn=978-0-614-22229-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpoeAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Nash+Rambler+first+modern+compact+car |page=193 |quote=...the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation introduced the first modern compact car in 1950, and revived the name "Rambler" that dated back to 1902 when Thomas B.

While the "Big Three" continued to introduce ever-larger cars during the 1950s, the new [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) focused its business strategy on smaller-sized and fuel-efficient automobiles, years before a real need for them existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=Gerald C. |year=1986 |title=When it hits the fan: Managing the nine crises of business |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-41171-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/whenithitsfanman0000meye }}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC, a far smaller company than the "Big Three", positioned itself as a "dinosaur-fighter" ([[underdog]]); its compact Rambler models helped push AMC to third place in domestic automobile sales.&lt;ref&gt;[[#flory|Flory]], p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm |title=1965–1966 Rambler Ambassador |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69tfVYrM3?url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm |archivedate=13 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; American Motors also reincarnated its predecessor company's smallest Nash model as the "new" 1958 [[Rambler American]] for a second model run, an almost unheard-of phenomenon in automobile history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autos.ca/classic-cars/motoring-memories-amc-rambler-american-1958-1960 |last=Vance |first=Bill |title=Motoring Memories: AMC Rambler American 1958–1960 |publisher=www.autos.ca |date=28 July 2006 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915002342/http://www.autos.ca/classic-cars/motoring-memories-amc-rambler-american-1958-1960/ |archivedate=15 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Studebaker followed AMC's formula by restyling its mainstream economy-model sedan, calling it the [[Studebaker Lark|Lark]] and billing it as a compact. The Lark success helped give Studebaker a respite for several years before the company ceased automobile production in 1966.

During 1959 and 1960, the Big Three automakers planned to introduce their own "compact" cars. Ford and Chrysler's designs were scaled-down versions of the conventional American car, using four- or six-cylinder engines instead of V8s, and with bodies about 20% smaller than their standard cars.

An exception to this strategy was the Chevrolet Corvair. Led by General Manager Cole, Chevrolet designed a new car that deviated from traditional American norms of design. The car was powered by an air-cooled, horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine constructed with many major components made from aluminum. The engine was mounted in the rear of the car, driving the rear wheels through a compact [[transaxle]]. Suspension was independent at all four wheels. No [[Vehicle frame|conventional chassis]] was used, being the first [[Coachbuilder|unibody]] built by [[Fisher Body]]. The tires were a new wider, low-profile design mounted on wider wheels. The styling was unconventional for Detroit: subtle and elegant, with no tail-fins or chrome grille. Its engineering earned numerous patents, while ''Time'' magazine put Ed Cole and the Corvair on the cover, and ''Motor Trend'' named the Corvair as the 1960 "Car of the Year".

===Overview===
Corvairs proved to be quite successful with more than 200,000 sold in each of its first six model years. Chevrolet claimed that the rear-engine design offered packaging and economy advantages, providing the car with a lower silhouette, flat passenger compartment floor, no need for power-assisted steering or brakes and improvements in [[ride quality]], [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], and [[Car handling#Delivery of power to the wheels and brakes|braking balance]]. The design also attracted customers of other makes, primarily imports. The Corvair stood out, with engineering different from other American offerings. It used GM's [[GM Z platform|Z-body]], with design and engineering that advanced the [[rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]] most recently brought back into the market by cars including the [[Tatra 77]], [[Tucker Torpedo]], [[Fiat 500]], [[Porsche 356]], [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Renault Dauphine]], [[Subaru 360]], and [[NSU Prinz]]—and employed by the concurrent and short-lived [[Hino Contessa]].

The Corvair's power plant was an overhead-valve [[aluminum]], [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] {{convert|140|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[flat-six engine|flat-six]] (later enlarged, first to 145 and then to 164 cubic inches). The first Corvair engine produced {{convert|80|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Power peaked with the 1965–66 [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] {{convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Corsa engine option. The first generation model's [[swing axle]] rear suspension, invented and patented by engineer [[Edmund Rumpler]] in 1903, offered a comfortable ride. The design was replaced in 1965 model year with a fully [[independent rear suspension|independent]] trailing arm rear suspension similar to the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Corvette Sting Ray]].

The Corvair represented several breakthroughs in design for mass-produced Detroit vehicles, with 1,786,243 cars produced between 1960 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corvair.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=8:production-numbers-us&amp;Itemid=215 |title=Corvair Unibody Manufacture Reference |publisher=Corvair.org |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210617/http://www.corvair.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=8:production-numbers-us&amp;Itemid=215 |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corvaircentral.com/production_totals.asp |title=Corvair Production Totals |publisher=Corvaircentral.com |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140816194813/http://corvaircentral.com/production_totals.asp |archivedate=16 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960 Corvair 569 and 769 series four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedans]] were conceived as economy cars offering few amenities to keep the price competitive, with the 500 (standard model) selling for under $2,000. Powered by the [[Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine]] with {{convert|80|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and mated to a three-speed manual or optional extra-cost two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic transmission, the Corvair was designed to have comparable acceleration to the six-cylinder [[full-size]]d [[Chevrolet Biscayne]]. The Corvair's unique design included the "Quadri-Flex" independent suspension and "Unipack Power Team" of engine, transmission, and rear axle [[Transaxle|combined into a single unit]]. Similar to designs of European cars such as Porsche, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and others, "Quadri-Flex" used coil springs at all four wheels with independent rear suspension arms incorporated at the rear. Specially designed 6.5 by 13-inch four-ply tires mounted on 5.5 by 13&amp;nbsp;inch wheels were standard equipment. Available options included RPO 360, the Powerglide two-speed automatic transmission ($146), RPO 118, a gasoline heater ($74), RPO 119, an AM tube radio ($54), and by February 1960, the rear folding seat (formerly $32) was standard. Chevrolet produced 47,683 of the 569 model and 139,208 769 model deluxe sedans in 1960.
In January 1960 two-door coupe models were introduced designated as the 527 and 727 models. Despite their late January introduction of the coupe, these cars sold well; about 14,628 base model 527 coupes, 36,562 727 deluxe coupes.  Following the success of the upmarket "Mr. and Mrs. Monza" styling concept cars at the 1960 [[Chicago Auto Show]], management approved the neatly appointed bucket-seat DeLuxe trim of the 900 series Monza as a two-door club coupe only. The new Monza began arriving at Chevrolet dealers in April 1960 with sales of 11,926 Monza club coupes, making the coupe one of the most popular Corvairs.

The success of the Monza model showed Chevrolet management that the Corvair was more of a specialty car than a competitor to the conventionally designed Ford Falcon or Chrysler's Valiant. Corvair was not as competitive in the economy segment. Chevrolet began a design program that resulted in a compact car with a conventional layout, the [[Chevy II]], for the 1962 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Gunnell|editor-first=John|title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946–1975 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1987|isbn=978-0-87341-096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An available option on the Corvair introduced in February 1960 was RPO 649, a more powerful engine, the "Super Turbo Air". Super Turbo Air was rated at {{convert|95|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm and {{convert|125|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,800 rpm due to a revised [[camshaft]], revised cylinder heads with dual springs, and a lower restriction muffler with a 2" outlet. This option was available in any Corvair model, except in 1960, the RPO 649 was not available with RPO 360, the Powerglide automatic transmission.

The advertised February introduction of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission (RPO 651) was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three-speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising of the potential for differential failure due to external leaks at the front of the transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four-speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast-iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the improvements undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.

The Corvair was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]] for 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_1001_1960_car_of_the_year/ |title=Bar Talk: 1960 Car of the Year Making You An Instant Expert On The Chevrolet Corvair |date=December 2009 |magazine=Motor Trend |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204005730/http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_1001_1960_car_of_the_year/ |archivedate=4 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Chevrolet introduced the Monza upscale trim to the four-door sedans and the club coupe body styles. With its newly introduced four-speed floor-mounted transmission, DeLuxe vinyl bucket seats, and upscale trim, the Monza Club Coupe gained in sales, as nearly 110,000 were produced along with 33,745 Monza four-door sedans. The four-speed Monza caught the attention of the younger market and was sometimes referred to as "the poor man's Porsche" in various car magazines. The Monza series contributed to about half of the Corvair sales in 1961.

A [[station wagon]], marketed as the [[Chevrolet Lakewood|Lakewood]], joined the lineup in 1961 with its engine located under the cargo floor and offering 68&amp;nbsp;ft³ (1.9&amp;nbsp;m³) of cargo room; 58&amp;nbsp;ft³ in the main passenger compartment, and another 10&amp;nbsp;ft³ in the front trunk. The Corvair engine received its first size increase to {{convert|145|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} via a slight increase in bore size and was rated at {{convert|98|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The base engine was still rated at {{convert|80|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} when paired with the manual transmissions and {{convert|84|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} when mated to the optional automatic transmission in Monza models. To increase luggage capacity in the front trunk, the spare tire was relocated to the engine compartment (in cars without air conditioning) and new "direct air" heater directed warmed air from the cylinders and heads to the passenger compartment. The gasoline heater remained available as an option through 1963. Factory air conditioning was offered as a mid-1961 option introduction. The condenser lay flat atop the horizontal engine fan. A large, green-painted reverse rotation version of the standard GM Frigidaire air-conditioning compressor was used, and an evaporator housing was added under the dash with integrated outlets surrounding the radio housing. Air conditioning was not available on wagons, Greenbrier/Corvair 95, or the turbocharged models introduced later, due to space constraints. 
Chevrolet also introduced the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|Corvair 95 line of light-duty]] trucks and vans, using the Corvair Powerpack with forward-control, or "[[cab over]]", with the driver sitting over the front wheels, as in the [[Volkswagen Type 2]].

The [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|Greenbrier Sportswagon]] used the same body as the "Corvan 95" [[panel van]] with the side windows option, but was marketed as a station wagon and was available with trim and paint options similar to the passenger cars. The "Corvan 95" model was also built in [[pickup truck|pickup]] versions; the [[Chevrolet Loadside|Loadside]] was a fairly typical pickup of the era, except for the rear engine, forward controls, and a pit in the middle of the bed. The more popular [[Chevrolet Rampside|Rampside]] had a unique, large, fold-down ramp on the side of the bed for ease of loading wheeled items.
[[File:Corvair turbo engine.jpg|thumb|The Corvair Spyder [[turbocharged]] engine]]

In 1962, Chevrolet introduced the Corvairs with few changes at the beginning of the year. The bottom line 500 series station wagon was dropped and the 700 became the base station wagon. The "Lakewood" name was dropped. The ever-popular Monza line then took on a wagon model to round out the top of the line. 
In spring of 1962, Chevrolet committed itself to the sporty image they had created for the Corvair by introducing a convertible version, then offering a high-performance {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] "Spyder"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monzamotion.com/index.php/blog/128-1964-corvair-spyder-most-desirable-em-chevrolet-164ci-turbo-12532|title=Monza Motion – 1964 Chevrolet Corvair Spyder most desirable Early Model|last=Johnson|first=Anthony|website=www.monzamotion.com|access-date=2016-09-30|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002181915/https://www.monzamotion.com/index.php/blog/128-1964-corvair-spyder-most-desirable-em-chevrolet-164ci-turbo-12532|archivedate=2 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; option for Monza coupes and convertibles, making the Corvair the second production automobile supplied with a turbocharger as a factory option, with the [[Oldsmobile F-85]] Turbo Jetfire having been released earlier in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvG0gq4DxecC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Corvair+first+turbo |page=21 |title=Turbocharging Performance Handbook |first=Jeff |last=Hartman |year=2007 |publisher=MBI Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7603-2805-7 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corvair station wagons were discontinued at that point in favor the new Corvair Convertible and [[Chevy II]] (built at the same assembly plant). The slow-selling Loadside pickup was discontinued at the end of the model year. The rest of the Corvair 95 line of Forward Control vehicles continued.
Optional equipment on all passenger cars (except wagons) included metallic brake linings and a heavy-duty suspension consisting of a front anti-roll bar, rear-axle limit straps, revised spring rates, and recalibrated shock absorbers. These provided a major handling improvement by reducing the potentially violent camber change of the rear wheels when making sharp turns at high speeds. The Turbocharged Spyder equipment group featured a multigauge instrument cluster which included a [[tachometer]], cylinder head temperature, and intake manifold pressure gauges, Spyder fender script, and Turbo logo deck emblems, in addition to the high-performance engine.

The Monza Coupe was the most popular model with 151,738 produced out of 292,531 total Corvair passenger car production for 1962. [[John Fitch (racing driver)|John Fitch]], chose the Corvair as the basis for "[[Corvair Fitch Sprint|Sprint]]" models. These included various performance improvements along with appearance modifications. Individual components were available to customers and several Chevrolet dealers became authorized to install the "Sprint" conversions.

The 1963 model year had the optional availability of a long 3.08 gear for improved fuel economy, but the Corvair otherwise remained largely carryover with minor trim and engineering changes. Self-adjusting brakes were new for 1963. Of all the Corvairs sold in 1963, fully 80% were Monzas. The convertible model accounted for over 20% of all the Monzas sold. 

Significant engineering changes were introduced for 1964, while the model lineup and styling remained relatively unchanged. The engine displacement was increased from {{convert|145|to|164|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} by an increase in stroke. The base engine power increased from {{convert|80|to|95|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and the high-performance engine increased from {{convert|95|to|110|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The Spyder engine rating remained at {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} despite the displacement increase of the engine. In 1964, an improvement in the car's swing axle rear suspension occurred with the addition of a transverse leaf spring along with softer rear coil springs designed to diminish rear roll stiffness and foster more neutral handling. Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models. The heavy-duty suspension was no longer optional, although all models now had a front anti-roll bar as standard. Brakes were improved with finned rear drums. The remaining pickup, the Rampside, was discontinued at the end of the model year.

Despite a vastly improved 1964 model, Corvair sales declined by close to 80,000 units that year. This was attributed to a number of factors, including the basic styling being 5 years old, the lack of a pillarless hardtop (which virtually all competing compact models had), the lack of a V8 engine, and the introduction of the [[Ford Mustang]] on 17 April, which broke all records for sales of a new model (and ate into Corvair sales).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The Corvair second generation arrived for model year 1965, noted for its lack of a [[pillar (car)|"B" pillar]] and a new fully [[independent suspension]] replacing the original [[swing axle]] rear suspension. The Corvair used coil springs at each wheel.

''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[David E. Davis Jr.]] showed enthusiasm for the 1965 Corvair in their October 1964 issue:

:"And it is here too, that we have to go on record and say that the Corvair is in our opinion—the most important new car of the entire crop of '65 models, and the most beautiful car to appear in this country since before World War II." "When the pictures of the '65 Corvair arrived in our offices, the man who opened the envelope actually let out a great shout of delight and amazement on first seeing the car, and in thirty seconds the whole staff was charging around, each wanting to be the first to show somebody else, each wanting the vicarious kick of hearing that characteristic war-whoop from the first-time viewer." "Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars—then we went nuts all over again. The new rear suspension, the new softer spring rates in front, the bigger brakes, the addition of some more power, all these factors had us driving around like idiots—zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other, standing on the brakes—until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist&amp;nbsp;... The '65 Corvair is an outstanding car. It doesn't go fast enough, but we love it."

The standard {{convert|95|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and optional {{convert|110|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engines were carried forward from 1964. The previous {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Spyder engine was replaced by the normally aspirated {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for the new Corsa. The engine was unusual in offering four single-throat [[carburetor]]s, to which were added larger valves and a dual exhaust system. A {{convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged engine was optional on the Corsa, which offered either standard three-speed or optional (US$92) four-speed manual transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#flory|Flory]], p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engine was optional on 500 and Monza models with manual or Powerglide transmissions. All engines got some of the heavy-duty internal parts from the Turbocharged engine for better durability.

New refinements appeared on the 1965 redesign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corvaircorsa.com/corsa.html |title=Car and Driver |publisher=Corvaircorsa.com |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531063642/http://www.corvaircorsa.com/corsa.html |archivedate=31 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corsa came standard with an instrument panel featuring a {{convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer with resettable trip odometer, a 6,000&amp;nbsp;rpm tachometer, cylinder head temperature gauge, analog clock with a sweeping second hand, a manifold vacuum/pressure gauge and fuel gauge. A much better heater system, larger brakes borrowed from the Chevelle, a stronger differential ring gear, a Delcotron alternator (replacing the generator), and significant chassis refinements were made. Out back, a new fully articulated rear suspension virtually eliminated the danger of the previous generation's swing axles, and was based on the contemporary Corvette Sting Ray (Corvair used coil springs while the Sting Ray uses a transverse leaf). AM/FM stereo radio, in-dash All Weather Air Conditioning, telescopically adjustable steering column, and a Special Purpose Chassis Equipment ("Z17") handling package, consisting of a special performance suspension and quick ratio steering box, were significant new options for 1965. The Monza and Corvair 500 Sport Sedans were the only compact cars ever available in the U.S. as pillarless four door hardtops.

The [[station wagon]], panel van, and [[pickup truck|pickup]] body styles had all been dropped and 1965 was the last year for the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier#1961–1965 Corvair Greenbrier Sportswagon|Greenbrier]] window van, which was retained mainly for fleet orders, with 1,528 being built. In all, 235,528 Corvairs were built in 1965, an increase of 30,000 units over 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[[#flory|Flory]], p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Chevrolet replaced the Corvair-based vans with the [[General Motors van|Chevrolet Sportvan/GMC Handi-Van]], which used a traditional front-engine/rear-drive axle borrowed from the [[Chevy II]].

[[File:1968 Chevrolet Corvair 110 coupé rear.jpg|thumb|1968 Corvair Monza coupe with 110-hp engine. The clear front side marker light was only for 1968.]]
The 1966 lineup remained essentially unchanged from 1965. One change of note was a new four-speed synchromesh transmission using the standard [[Saginaw]] gear set with 3.11:1 first gear ratio used by other GM 6-cylinder vehicles. The steering column was changed to a two-piece design with universal joint, lessening the danger of intrusion during a front-end collision (actually a mid-1965 running change). A plastic air dam was installed below the front valence panel to conceal the front suspension and underbody, and lessen crosswind sensitivity. In front, The "lock door" emblem (covering the [[lockset]] for the trunk lock) was changed from red to blue and featured a shorter bar. At the rear, new larger taillight lenses were used featuring a thin chrome ring around the center of the light. Air conditioned cars received a new condenser that was mounted in front of the engine, eliminating the previous unit mounted atop the engine, requiring its removal for most engine service. The Corvair script nameplate was moved from atop the trunk lid to a position next to the driver's side headlight bezel. Sales began a decline as a result of Nader's book and the new Mustang that offered V8s up to {{convert|271|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} compared to the Corvair's {{convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} top powertrain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#flory|Flory]], p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; and rumors of the upcoming "Panther'—the code name for the forthcoming Camaro, slated as a direct competitor for the Mustang. A decision was made to discontinue further development of the Corvair. Production for the model year was down to 103,743.&lt;ref&gt;[[#flory|Flory]], p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{check quotation}}
In 1967, the Corvair line was trimmed to the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans, and the Monza Convertible. This model year was the first with a collapsible steering column. A dual circuit master cylinder with warning light, nylon reinforced brake hoses, stronger steel (instead of aluminum) door hinges, "mushroomed" instrument panel knobs and a vinyl-edged day/night mirror were all made standard equipment. Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same "Astro" style as those on the new-for-1967 Camaro, featuring a new-thin-shell design. Chevrolet introduced a {{convert|50000|mi|km|abbr=on}} engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair. Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in 1967, including color print ads and an "I Love My Corvair" bumper sticker campaign by dealers, but production and sales continued to fall off drastically. Only 27,253 copies were built.&lt;ref&gt;[[#flory|Flory]], p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; The chrome rings around the center of the taillights were made thicker.

In 1968, the four-door hardtop was discontinued, leaving three models—the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and the Monza Convertible. Air conditioning was dropped as an option, due to concerns about thermal loading added by the now-standard Air Injection Reactor ("smog pump") which probably hurt sales as factory air became more popular generally in automobiles. The GM multiplex stereo system was also discontinued when new units changed wiring adapters; the Corvair's 9-pin connector would no longer fit the new units. Additional safety features, including side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models, were fitted per the federal government's requirements. Steering wheel for 500s was the same as the base Nova's, while Monzas got the same wheel as the Camaro. An Impala-style "Deluxe" steering wheel was optional. All advertising was virtually stopped and sales were down to 15,400.

The final model-year 1969 Corvairs were assembled with the Nova in Willow Run, Michigan, the same facility Corvairs had been built from the beginning. A total of 6,000 Corvairs were produced of which only 521 were Monza Convertibles. The Corvair was the only GM car in 1969 that did not get a locking steering column. Demand for Novas was high and a decision was made in November 1968 to move Corvair assembly to a special off-line area in the plant, dubbed the "Corvair Room", making Corvairs produced between that time and 14 May 1969 essentially hand-built by a dedicated Corvair team. Assembled bodies arrived from Fisher Body and awaited assembly in the off-line area.

===End of production===
While the 1965 Corvair was received as a well-engineered high performance driver's car, that accomplishment was overshadowed by the phenomenal market success of the [[Ford Mustang]]. GM saw advantages to the route adopted by Ford with the Mustang, a four-seat semi-coupe body on a standard compact (Falcon) chassis with a small-block V8 motor and four-on-the-floor offered as power options. The Corvair was not cheap to produce; developing and marketing a Mustang-style model based on the Nova platform had cost advantages. Unlike the Corvair, a derivative model could evolve within GM's standard lines of manufacturing technology. The 1965 publication of ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'' sullied the reputation of the Corvair line, although the issues had nothing to do with the current model. Under competition from the Mustang and the publicity hit of ''Unsafe,'' Corvair sales plummeted by over half in 1966. GM saw the advantages of developing the [[Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)|Camaro]], not the Corvair.

According to GM historian Dave Newell, Chevrolet had planned on ending Corvair production after the 1966 model year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Development and engineering changes were halted in 1966 on the year-old, redesigned second-generation cars with mainly federally mandated emissions and safety changes made thereafter. An increasing lack of interest from the company, especially from Chevrolet's General Manager [[John DeLorean]], and a complete absence of Corvair advertising after 1967 reflected the company's priorities, including promotion of three redesigned models for 1968—the Corvette, [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]], and [[Chevy II Nova]]. The Corvair was referred to as "the phantom" by ''Car Life'' magazine in their 1968 Monza road test, and by 1969 Chevrolet's Corvair four-page brochure was "by request only". During its final year of production, 6,000 cars were produced.

Chevrolet had proposed a third generation (1970-on) Corvair, essentially a re-skin of the 1965–69 model resembling the 1973 GM A Body intermediates, particularly the 1973 Pontiac [[Pontiac Grand Am#1973–1975|Grand Am]], retaining Corvair proportions. Having passed the point of full scale clay models, Chevrolet stopped developing the model in early 1968.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Unlike the Turbo Hydramatic 400, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] 350 transmission, introduced in the 1968 Camaro and later adopted by most Chevrolet models had been configured for use in the third generation Corvair.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Handling issues==
[[File:1960-63 Corvair.jpg|thumb|1960–63 swing axle suspension]]
[[File:Swing Axle Diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Swing axle suspension characteristics:&lt;br/&gt;[[Camber angle|camber]] change on bumps, [[Suspension (vehicle)#Jacking forces|jacking]] on rebound]]
The first-generation Corvair featured a ''rear engine + [[swing axle]] design'' similar to that of the [[Renault Dauphine]] and [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]] &amp;ndash; a design which eliminates [[universal joint]]s at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts, rather than the road surface. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large [[camber angle]] changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing "rebound" camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and [[oversteer]]—a [[Directional stability|dynamically unstable]] condition where a driver can lose control and spin. The problem is most severe with rear-engine swing axle combinations because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels and the higher center of gravity during rebound camber conditions. The additional high weight of a station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency. Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires ([[lift-off oversteer]]). Understeer is common in front-engine cars, due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits.
Design options to ameliorate swing axle handling:
*'''Anti-roll bar:''' As a production option, engineers had advocated but management rejected the inclusion of a front [[anti-roll bar]] on the original 1960 Corvair, which would have ameliorated the car's handling &amp;ndash; shifting [[weight transfer]] to the front outboard tire, considerably reducing rear [[slip angle]]s—thereby avoiding potential oversteer.
*'''Tire pressure differential:''' As with the [[Renault Dauphine]] and pre-1968 [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen Beetle]], Corvair engineers relied on a cost-free ''tire pressure differential'' to eliminate oversteer characteristics &amp;ndash; low front and high rear tire pressure&amp;ndash;a strategy which induced [[understeer]] (increasing front slip angles faster than the rear). Nonetheless, the strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tires (e.g., to typical pressures for other cars with other, more prevalent suspension systems). The recommended low front tire pressure also compromised the tire load capacity.

While the Corvair ''sedan'' offered competent handling,&lt;ref name="John Braithwaite 1983. p. 30"/&gt; "the average buyer more accustomed to front-engined cars, did not take [into] account the car's different handling characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;[[#flory|Flory]], p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; Chevrolet made a succession of improvements to the first-generation Corvair suspension. For the 1962 model year, the front anti–roll bar became available as an option. For the 1964 model year, the front anti-roll bar became standard equipment and the rear suspension was modified to include a camber compensating, transverse-mounted [[leaf spring]] extending between the rear wheels to limit rear wheel camber change, and carrying much of the rear weight combined with softer coil springs.

For the 1965 model year, the Corvair received a fully [[Multi-link suspension|independent rear suspension]] closely resembling that of the contemporary Corvette. The redesigned suspension reduced the rear [[Suspension (vehicle)#Roll center height|roll center]] to half its previous height, using fully articulated half-axles that offered constant camber on the rear tires in all driving situations. This eliminated the handling problems of the first-generation models.

===Legal fallout===
[[Consumer protection]] activist [[Ralph Nader]] addressed the handling issues of the first-generation (1960–1963) Corvair in his 1965 book, ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]''. GM had over 100 lawsuits pending in connection with crashes involving the Corvair, which subsequently became the initial material for Nader's investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Diana T. |last=Kurylko |title=Nader Damned Chevy's Corvair and Sparked a Safety Revolution |journal=Automotive News |volume=70 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book highlighted crashes related to the Corvair's suspension and identified the Chevrolet suspension engineer who had fought management's decision to remove—for cost reasons—the front [[anti-sway bar]] installed on later models. Nader said during subsequent Congressional hearings, the Corvair is "the leading candidate for the un-safest-car title".&lt;ref name="Time2"/&gt; Subsequently, Corvair sales fell from 220,000 in 1965 to 109,880 in 1966. By 1968, production fell to 14,800.&lt;ref name="Time2"/&gt; Public response to the book played a role in the [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act]] in 1966.

A 1972 safety commission report conducted by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] concluded that the 1960–1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations.&lt;ref name="John Braithwaite 1983. p. 30"&gt;{{cite book|first=Brent |last=Fisse |first2=John |last2=Braithwaite |title=The Impact of Publicity on Corporate Offenders |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1983 |page=30 |isbn=978-0-87395-732-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] testing from the previous year. NHTSA had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars—a [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Plymouth Valiant]], [[Volkswagen Beetle]], and [[Renault Dauphine]]—along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling.&lt;ref name="NHTSA" /&gt; NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that "the 1960–63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests [...] the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic." Former GM executive and automotive engineer [[John DeLorean]] asserted in his book ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors'' that Nader's criticisms were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John Z.|last=DeLorean|authorlink=John DeLorean|title=On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors|page=[https://archive.org/details/oncleardayyoucan00delo/page/51 51]|publisher=Avon|year=1980|isbn=978-0380517220|url=https://archive.org/details/oncleardayyoucan00delo/page/51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[David E. Davis]], in a 2009 article in ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'', noted that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous, [[Porsche]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]], and [[Volkswagen]] all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=American Driver: The Late Ralph Nader |first=David E. |last=Davis Jr. |journal=Automobile |date=April 2009 |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/columns/0502_ralph_nader/ |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531063818/http://www.automobilemag.com/features/columns/0502_ralph_nader/ |archivedate=31 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The handling of other rear-engine swing-axle cars, particularly the Volkswagen Type I and II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Center for Auto Safety|title=Small on Safety:The designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen|date=1972|url=https://www.amazon.com/Small-safety-designed-dangers-Volkswagen/dp/0670652490|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410075007/http://www.amazon.com/Small-safety-designed-dangers-Volkswagen/dp/0670652490|archivedate=10 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticized as well.) Some contend that Nader's lack of an automotive engineering degree or a driver's license at the time he wrote ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' disqualifies him as a critic of automotive safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whiteside |first=Thomas |date=1972 |title=The Investigation of Ralph Nader: General Motors Vs.

==Reception==
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' featured [[Ed Cole]] and the 1960 Corvair on its cover for the Corvair introduction in 1959 and said: "its fresh engineering is hailed as the forerunner of a new age of innovation in Detroit."&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Autos: The Last Corvair |journal=Time |date=23 May 1969 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900895,00.html#ixzz0v4XCjy9Wl |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824103254/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900895,00.html#ixzz0v4XCjy9Wl |archivedate=24 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' reported in 1960: Chevrolet sold 26,000 Corvairs its first two days on the market, taking over 35% of Chevy's two-day total of 75,000.

Shortly after its introduction, the Corvair faced competition from the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] and [[Mercury Comet]] and was plagued by problems&lt;ref name="Time4"/&gt;—though according to a 1960 ''Time'' report, "many were the minor bugs that often afflict a completely new car."&lt;ref name="Time4"/&gt; Problems included an engine cooling fan belt that tended to pop off its 2-axis pulleys (unless the fan ran constantly, the air-cooled engine would overheat and seize), carburetor icing and poor fuel mileage "which sometimes runs well under 20 m.p.g."&lt;ref name="Time4"/&gt; The 1960 model gasoline heater was cited as a problem, which itself could consume up to a quart of gas an hour&lt;ref name="Time4"/&gt;—with Chevrolet engineers quickly modifying the Corvair's carburetors to improve economy.&lt;ref name="Time4"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Business: The People's Choice |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828668,00.html#ixzz0v4apyEeB |date=8 February 1960 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818140439/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828668,00.html#ixzz0v4apyEeB |archivedate=18 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Motor Trend]]'' awarded the Corvair its "Car of the Year" award for 1960.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Corvair|publisher=Corvair Society of America|url= http://www.northtexascorvair.org/corvairhistory.htm |accessdate=16 August 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140531063214/http://www.northtexascorvair.org/corvairhistory.htm |archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and reputation==
The Corvair's reputation and legacy, as well as those of General Motors, were tarnished by accusations about its handling ability: the car was scrutinized in [[Ralph Nader]]'s 1965 book ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]''. GM's top management resorted to unethical measures in response to its accuser. Ralph Nader's accusations were proven false by the 1972 [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] safety commission report.  Support for the tests, conducted at College Station, Texas was provided by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTl). [[Texas A&amp;M University]] Research Foundation. The investigation concluded: "The 1960-1963 Corvair understeers in the same manner as conventional passenger cars up to about 0.4g lateral acceleration, makes a transition from understeer, through neutral steer, to oversteer in a range from about 0.4g to 0.5g lateral acceleration. This transition does not result in abnormal potential for loss of control. The limited accident data available indicates that the rollover rate of the 1960-1963 Corvair is comparable to other light domestic cars. The 1960-1963 Corvair compared favorably with the other contemporary vehicles used in the NHTSA Input Response Tests. The handling and stability performance of the 1960-1963 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic.”&lt;ref name="NHTSA"&gt;{{cite journal|author=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |title=PB 211-015: Evaluation of the 1960–1963 Corvair Handling and Stability|date=July 1972 |publisher=National Technical Information Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its other body styles, Chevrolet marketed the Corvair also in [[van]] and pickup body styles, in rear-load or side-load configurations, as the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier#1961–1965 Corvair Greenbrier Sportswagon|Corvair Greenbrier]].

===Model designations===
{{more citations needed|date=February 2012}}
[[File:Flickr - DVS1mn - 62 Chevrolet Corvair Rampside Pick-Up (1).jpg|thumb|1962 Chevrolet Corvair Rampside]]
Rampside &amp;ndash; Corvair pickup with a ramp on one side that was available 1961–1964

500 &amp;ndash; base model Corvair with lowest trim level. Always came with rubber mats, bench seats, and very little trim.

700 &amp;ndash; next trim level up from the 500 model. These models also came with rubber mats and bench seats but had a little bit more trim (this model was discontinued after 1964).

Lakewood &amp;ndash; Corvair station wagon (1961–62) available as a 500 or 700. The Monza wagon was available in 1962 and is not really a Lakewood. All window glass was specific to this model due to its taller roofline.

Monza (900) &amp;ndash; the top of the trim line for 1960–1963 only. In 1964, it was below the Monza spyder, which was now its own model. For the 1965–66 model year, the Monza ranked below the Corsa in trim level. After the Corsa model was dropped, the Monza was once again the top of the Corvair line for 1967–1969. Monzas usually came with bucket seats (although special bench seats were available in some years). Monzas had carpeting and special trim packages.

Spyder &amp;ndash; the Monza spyder was an option package during the 1962–63 model year, and in 1964 became a full-fledged model. It was equipped with a {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged engine, "full instrumentation", special emblems, and all the "Monza" trim items.

Corsa &amp;ndash; top of the line sport model for 1965–66. It was the only model available with the optional {{convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged flat-six. The base engine was the new four-carburetor {{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} "big valve" engine. Corsas had "full instrumentation", special emblems, and trim with a special "argent" silver painted rear cove area and pinstriping on the 1965 models. The optional 180&amp;nbsp;hp engine delivered an increase in power over the 1964 150&amp;nbsp;hp engine of the same displacement by slightly enlarging the carburetor, and increasing the size of the internal impeller and turbine blades.

Corvan (95) &amp;ndash; Corvair panel van that was available 1961–1964

[[Chevrolet Greenbrier#1961–1965 Corvair Greenbrier Sportswagon|Greenbrier]] &amp;ndash; windowed van that was available 1961–1965

Loadside &amp;ndash; Corvair pickup without the ramp which was available 1961–62

Deluxe &amp;ndash; option package of upgraded interior and trim available on some of the "van" models

F.C. (forward control) &amp;ndash; a Chevy term that applied to all Corvair 95 van models indicating that the driver and controls were forward of the front wheels

==Concept cars==
[[File:Corvair Monza GT.1.jpg|thumb|[[Corvair Monza GT]] Concept|alt=]]

The Corvair spawned a number of innovative concept vehicles including the Corvair SS, [[Corvair Monza GT|Monza GT]], Monza SS, Astro I. In Europe, Italian coachbuilder [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] designed a very advanced one-off prototype for the [[Geneva Motor Show#1963|1963 Geneva Motor Show]]; the "[[Chevrolet Testudo]]". This was among the first designs of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]], the chief designer at Bertone at the time. The Testudo later suffered a collision with another [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] concept car, the [[Alfa Romeo Canguro]], while on track at the [[Monza circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/cars/classic-concepts-1964-alfa-romeo-canguro|title=Classic Concepts: 1964 Alfa Romeo Canguro|website=www.classicdriver.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a [[Carrozzeria Pininfarina|Pininfarina]] built concept called the "Corvair Speciale", and two other Pininfarina concepts known as "Coupe I" and "Coupe II".

The Chevrolet [[Corvair Monza GT]] coupe toured together with the Monza SS (Spyder) in early 1963, making a public appearance at the [[New York International Auto Show]]. Although both cars were based on the Corvair drivetrain, each represented a futuristic development of the Corvair design. In the SS convertible, the engine (with a four-carburetor setup) was left in its stock location behind the transaxle, allowing for a shorter ({{convert|88|in|mm|abbr=on}}) wheelbase. The Monza GT is housed at the GM's Heritage Center in Detroit.

A 1966 [[concept vehicle]], the Electrovair II was a 1966 Monza 4-door hardtop modified with a 532 volt, {{Convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on}} electric motor replacing the gasoline engine—following a 1964 version known as Electrovair I. With the 1966 model, silver-zinc batteries were used and placed in the trunk and engine compartment, and the body was slightly modified to accept the conversion. The car was handicapped by the high cost of the batteries ($160,000), a limited driving range ({{Convert|40–80|mi|km|abbr=on}}), and short battery life.&lt;ref name="electrovair"&gt;{{cite web |title=GM's long road back to electric cars |publisher=CNN Money.com |date=7 April 2009 |url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/autos/0809/gallery.gm_electric_cars/3.html |accessdate=16 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085515/http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/autos/0809/gallery.gm_electric_cars/3.html |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Trend'' January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing and modified Corvairs==
===Yenko Stinger===
{{More footnotes|section|date=December 2011}}
[[File:1965 Yenko Stinger.jpg|thumb|A 1965 Yenko Stinger in a vintage race at [[Watkins Glen International]]]]

[[Don Yenko]], who had been racing Corvettes, could not compete successfully against the [[Carroll Shelby]] Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit into any of the [[SCCA]] categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into "sports cars" by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to [[homologate]] the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965. Although all were white, as the SCCA required for American cars at the time, {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [the normal competition trim for U.S.-built cars was white with 2 blue stripes] there was a great deal of variety between individual cars; some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers, some did not; some received engine upgrades developing 160, 190, 220, or 240&amp;nbsp;hp (119, 142, 164, or 179&amp;nbsp;kW). All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy duty [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], four speed [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], quicker [[steering]] ratio, "positraction" [[limited-slip differential]]s (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 when Chevrolet dropped the 3.89) and dual brake [[master cylinder]]s (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become stock equipment the next year). Because most of the engine cooling in air-cooled engines is done by circulating oil, an oil cooler was necessary for competition use, this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the left wheel.

The Stingers competed in Class D production, which was dominated by the [[Triumph TR4]], which was very quick in racing trim; in its first race in January 1966, and the Stinger was able to come in second only by one second. By the end of the 1966 season, Jerry Thompson had won the Central Division Championship and placed fifth in the 1966 Nationals, [[Dick Thompson (driver)|Dick Thompson]], a highly successful Corvette race driver, had won the Northeast Division Championship, and Jim Spencer had won the Central Division Championship, with Dino Milani taking second place. The next year, Chevrolet dropped the Corsa line. The Monza line was initially not available stock with the 4-carburetor engine; it was eventually offered as a special performance option, along with the 3.89 differential. The Monza instrumentation did not have a tachometer or head temperature gauges, which had to be separately installed. The SCCA, on the other hand, had relaxed its ruling regarding color, and the cars were available in red or blue. It is believed that only fourteen 1967 Stingers were built, but Dana Chevrolet, who distributed Stingers on the U.S. West coast, ordered an additional three similar cars to be built to Stinger specifications, but with the AIR injection system to meet [[California Air Resources Board|California emissions laws]], with Yenko's permission. A total of 185 Stingers are believed to have been built, the last being YS-9700 built for [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] as a tire test vehicle in 1969–1970. [[Comedian]], television star, and car enthusiast [[Tim Allen]] owned and raced Yenko Stinger #YS-043 until he sold it (June, 2009).

===Fitch Sprint===
{{main article|Corvair Fitch Sprint}}
Longtime roadracer [[John Fitch (driver)|John Fitch]] was particularly interested in the Corvair as the basis for a spirited road and track oriented car, due to its handling. The basic Sprint received only minor modifications to the engine, bringing it to {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, but upgrades to the [[shock absorber]]s and [[Spring (device)|springs]], adjustments to the [[wheel alignment]], quicker [[steering ratio]], alloy wheels, metallic [[brake lining]]s, the obligatory wood-rimmed steering wheel (leather available for an additional $9.95) and other such minor alterations made it extremely competitive with European sports cars costing much more. Body options such as spoilers were available, but the most visually remarkable option was the "Ventop", a fiberglass overlay for the C-pillars and rear of the roof that gave the car a "flying buttress" profile.

Fitch went on to design and build a prototype of the Fitch Phoenix, a Corvair-based two-seat [[sports car]], superficially resembling a smaller version of the [[Mako Shark (concept car)|Mako Shark]] based Corvette. With a total weight of {{convert|1950|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, even with a steel body, and with the Corvair engine modified with [[Weber carburetor]]s to deliver {{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, the car delivered spirited performance for $8,760. The ability to produce automobiles on a small scale, along with Chevrolet's decision to terminate production of the Corvair, meant the end of Fitch's plan. He still retained the prototype, and occasionally exhibited it at car shows until his death. One 1 June 2014, the Fitch Phoenix went to auction at Bonhams in the Greenwich Concours and sold for 230,000 US dollars. The car is still in Connecticut with the new owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ctnews.com/connecticutpostings/2014/06/04/the-fitch-phoenix-to-remain-in-connecticut/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141204233609/http://blog.ctnews.com/connecticutpostings/2014/06/04/the-fitch-phoenix-to-remain-in-connecticut/|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 December 2014|title=Connecticut Spice|website=Connecticut Spice|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Fitch sold his inventory to Art Hershberger of Princeton, Wisconsin. Hershberger made minor styling modifications to several Corvairs and sold them as Solar Sprints and Solar Cavaliers. The main distinguishing feature of the Solar was its [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] taillights.

===Winfield's cars: Reactor &amp; Piranha===
[[Gene Winfield]], the automotive customizer. built two models in the mid 1960s that used the unique qualities of the lightweight and low Corvair engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-we.com/piranha/GeneWinfield.htm|title=Gene Winfield - Legendary Custom Car Builder|website=www.c-we.com|accessdate=28 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528103633/http://www.c-we.com/piranha/GeneWinfield.htm|archivedate=28 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Reactor''' came when Winfield was tasked with showing the benefits of an [[aluminum]] bodied car. What he developed was an extremely low slung two seat [[MF layout|mid-engine front wheel drive car]]. He used the 180&amp;nbsp;hp turbocharged engine from the Corvair Corsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kustomrama.com/index.php?title=The_Reactor|title=Reactor - Kustomrama|website=www.kustomrama.com|accessdate=28 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511013723/https://www.kustomrama.com/index.php?title=The_Reactor|archivedate=11 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other drivetrain components came from the [[Citroën DS]], including the front wheel drive transaxle and [[height adjustable suspension]]. Winfield was able to place this vehicle in the 1960s television programs [[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]], [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]], and [[Bewitched]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.fotki.com/Rikster/11_car_photos/beautiful_custom_cars/gene_winfield/the_reactor/|title=The Reactor |author= Gene Winfield|website= www.fotki.com|accessdate=28 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512161750/http://public.fotki.com/Rikster/11_car_photos/beautiful_custom_cars/gene_winfield/the_reactor/|archivedate=12 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jalopnik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-only-time-star-trek-ever-showed-an-alien-ma-1786436766|title=This Is The Only Time Star Trek Ever Showed An Alien-Made Car|author=Jason Torchinsky|date=9 September 2016|publisher=Jalopnik|accessdate=7 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713065514/http://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-only-time-star-trek-ever-showed-an-alien-ma-1786436766|archivedate=13 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sports racing car—'''The Piranha'''—was developed around the same time, to demonstrate the use of a new plastic for the structural parts of the automobile—Cyclic [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]]. This lightweight (1,400&amp;nbsp;lb) vehicle was developed in several generations, using a rear-mounted Corvair engine. Model car company [[Aluminum Model Toys]] began small scale production of actual cars through their division run by [[Gene Winfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-we.com/piranha/page2.htm|title=Piranha &amp; Man from U.N.C.L.E.

===Custom, dune buggies and aircraft===
Corvair flat-six engines were a popular alternative to Volkswagen engines in [[dune buggy]] applications, and off-road racing. Some Corvair engines have also been used to power light and experimental aircraft such as [[Pietenpol Air Camper|Pietenpol's]], [[Zenith Aircraft Company|Zenith's]], and [[Sonex Aircraft|Sonex's]]. Much development work on the conversion of Corvair engines into flight-worthy powerplants has been carried out by William Wynne, who among others has been refining the process since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flycorvair.com/|title=www.FlyCorvair.com |website=www.flycorvair.com|access-date=2016-08-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809142142/http://flycorvair.com/|archivedate=9 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trans Am===
A Corvair was driven by Spurgeon May and [[Donna Mae Mims]] in the [[Trans Am Series]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cms.scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Trans-Am/1966.pdf |title=1966 Trans-Am box scores |publisher=cms.scca.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120424230730/http://cms.scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Trans-Am/1966.pdf |archivedate=24 April 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design influence==
The First-generation Corvair (1960–1964) has been credited with influencing car design worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issuu.com/retroautos/docs/retroautos_november__2014 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231094241/http://issuu.com/retroautos/docs/retroautos_november__2014 |archivedate=31 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Styled in GM's advanced styling studio in 1957, under the leadership of then director Ned Nickels, the compact design was made using cues from earlier Oldsmobile and Chevrolet models. The most notable design feature, its high wrap-around beltline, was "borrowed" by other carmakers not long after the Corvair's release. These cars included the [[BMW 1602]]/[[BMW 2002|2002]], [[NSU Prinz]], [[Hillman Imp]], Fiat 1300/00, [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia#Type 34 Karmann Ghia|Volkswagen Type 34 Karmann Ghia]], and the Mazda 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-how-the-1960-corvair-started-a-global-design-revolution/|title=Automotive History: How The 1960 Corvair Started A Global Design Revolution|website=www.curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=28 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024065543/http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-how-the-1960-corvair-started-a-global-design-revolution/|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corvair's combination of power and light weight introduced European manufacturers to an American market niche for small popular-priced sedans with more power and driveability than the contemporary European economy sedans and a more versatile and practical design than European sports cars. That overall concept was exemplified by Volkswagen's [[Type 34 Karmann Ghia]] and [[VW Type 3|Type 3]] "notchback" in 1961 and BMW's "[[BMW New Class|New Class]]" sedans in 1962. BMW developed the concept further by mass-marketing higher performance high quality sedans, setting the trend of the "sport sedan" category that would soon include offerings from a variety of European, and eventually Japanese, manufacturers.

The '''Chevrolet Lova RV''' is a subcompact MPV based on the [[Chevrolet Sail]].  The vehicle, launched in 2016, is produced by SAIC GM, a joint venture between American General Motors and SAIC of China. Unlike other MPVs in its size and price range, the Lova RV is sold exclusively in a 5-seat version.

== Design and marketing ==
[[File:Chevrolet Lova RV 002.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Lova RV rear]]
The Lova RV targets middle-class Chinese families and couples not interested in a subcompact SUV, and as such will slot above the Sail Sedan, and below family-oriented SUVs (such as the Captiva) in terms of pricing. Most of its competition will include domestic MPVs of a similar size, such as the Changan Eulove.

The Lova RV's family-friendly design combines a fascia that conforms to current Chevrolet design norms, thin pillars for enhanced visibility, and mid-range materials and GM technologies in the interior. Unlike many MPVs sold in China, the Lova RV is generously equipped with safety features, with dual airbags standard even on the base trim (LS)

== Technical specifications and trim Levels ==
The Lova RV is powered by a sole 1.5-liter inline-four, which is transversely mounted, and powers the front wheels. A choice of a 5-speed manual or 4-speed shiftable automatic transmission is offered on the LS, while the higher LT and LTZ trims get the automatic transmission as standard.

both powertrain versions fulfill the China-V emissions norm.

All versions of the Lova RV feature [[MacPherson strut|MacPherson]] front suspension and dependent torsion bar rear suspension, along with front disk brakes and rear drum brakes. This is a common way to reduce costs in this vehicle class. Fuel consumption is quoted at 5.6 l/100&amp;nbsp;km, or 42 mpg.

=== Trim levels ===
There are 3 trim levels available for the Lova RV: base LS, mid-range LT, and range-topping LTZ.

LS standard equipment includes:
* halogen headlamps
* LED tail lights
* electric adjustable mirrors
* adjustable plastic finish steering wheel
* 6-way manual driver's seat
* trip computer
* fabric seats (grey)
* 40/60 split rear seat
* ABS, CBC, EBD, ESC, TCS
* 2 front airbags
* central locking
* Air Conditioning
* digital-display radio with Aux and USB
* power windows
* 4 speakers
* 14 inch steel wheels (175/70R14)
LT trim Adds:

The '''Royal Mail''' models H-2 (1914–15) and H-2½ (1916), the '''Amesbury Special''' model H-3 (1915) and the '''Baby Grand''' model H-4 (1914–16) were [[United States|American]] cars made by [[Chevrolet]]. They would be replaced by the [[Chevrolet Series F]] in 1917.

== Beginning ==
[[File:1914-chevrolet.jpg|thumbnail|left|1914 Chevrolet H-4 Baby Grand]]
The Baby Grand was one of the first automobiles made by Chevrolet under [[William C. Durant|W.C. Durant]], GM's founder. It was part of his idea to build a car to compete with the very popular and cheap Model T Ford. When it first came out, it was priced at $875&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet_Brochure/1914%20Chevrolet-01.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a four-door, 5-passenger touring car&lt;ref name="conceptcarz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z7487/Chevrolet-Series-H.aspx |title=1914 Chevrolet Series H Images, Information and History (Baby Grand, Royal Mail, Turtledeck Roadster, H-2, H-4, H-3) |publisher=Conceptcarz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a 1914 Model T touring was $500).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtfca.com/encyclo/1914.htm |title=1914 |publisher=Mtfca.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A speedometer was standard.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1914"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet_Brochure/1914%20Chevrolet-03.html |title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet/1914_Chevrolet_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One advantage over a Model T Ford was that a Baby Grand could get an electric starter&lt;ref name="conceptcarz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1914"/&gt; (the Model T did not get them until 1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtfca.com/encyclo/1919.htm |title=1919 |publisher=Mtfca.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
In 1914 the Series H debuted with the H-2 Royal Mail Roadster and the H-4 5-seater Baby Grand Touring model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1914 Chevrolet|url=http://www.gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1914-Chevrolet.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502030712/http://gmheritagecenter.com/gm-heritage-archive/docs/Chevrolet/1914-Chevrolet.pdf|archivedate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; both with a {{convert|104|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase.

In 1915, all Series H models got a longer {{convert|106|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase and larger brakes, and an electric starter was now standard.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1915"&gt;{{cite web|author=the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1915-chevrolet-series-h.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "1915 Chevrolet Series H" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-08-01 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also for 1915 Chevrolet introduced the '''Amesbury Special''' model H-3, a 3-seat roadster (similar to the Royal Mail) that sold for $985. It came painted in French grey with green patent leather interior. The standard wheels were the plain wooden spoke type, but most of the cars sold had the optional Houk wire wheels which cost $125 extra and were painted green to match the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1915 Chevrolet|url=http://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/Chevrolet/1915-Chevrolet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadly due to poor sales this model was dropped after only one year.

In 1916, the '''Royal Mail''' model H-2½ was introduced which was the first integral trunk for Chevrolet with gas tank in the rear between the frame rails.

The Series H models were moved upmarket when the $490 [[Chevrolet Series 490|Chevrolet 490]] was introduced in June 1915 to compete directly with the Ford Model T.

Total Chevrolet production for 1913 was 5,987.

The '''Chevrolet Impala''' ({{IPAc-en|I|m|'|p|ae|l|@|,_|-|'|p|a:|l|@}}) is a [[full-size car]] built by [[Chevrolet]] for [[model year]]s 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and 2000 until 2020. The Impala was Chevrolet's popular flagship passenger car and was  amongst the better selling American made automobiles in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.motortrend.com/news/six-decades-of-best-selling-cars/|title=six-decades-of-best-selling-cars|last=Markus|first=Frank|date=March 11, 2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9404E1DB103FF93AA3575BC0A96F9C8B63.html|title=THE BLOG; What Car Sold Best? The Impala|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple [[taillight]]s. The [[Chevrolet Caprice]] was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] and the [[Chevrolet Biscayne]]. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-size model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994 and 1996, the Impala was revised as a [[GM LT engine|5.7-liter V8]]–powered version of the [[Chevrolet Caprice Classic]] sedan.

In 2000, the Impala was reintroduced again as a mainstream [[front-wheel drive]] car.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked #1 among Affordable Large Cars in ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''{{'}}s rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/Affordable-Large-Cars/|title=Best Affordable Large Cars Rankings |publisher=U.S. News}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the tenth generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the ninth generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. During that time both versions were sold in the United States and Canada. The current-generation Impala is also sold in the Middle East, China, and South Korea.

==History, origin and sales==
The Impala name was first used for the full-sized 1956 [[Motorama|General Motors Motorama]] show car that bore [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]-like design cues, especially the grille. It was named [[Impala]] after the graceful African antelope, and this animal became the car's logo.  Painted [[Paris green|emerald green]] metallic, with a white interior, the Impala [[concept car]] featured [[hardtop]] styling. Clare MacKichan's design team, along with designers from [[Pontiac]], started to establish basic packaging and dimensions for their shared 1958 General Motors "A" body in June. The first styling sketch that would directly influence the finished Chevrolet automobile was seen by General Motors Styling vice president [[Harley Earl]] in October. Seven months later, the basic design was developed.

For 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ |date=October 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.

The Impala was introduced for the 1958 model year as top of the line [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] hardtops and convertibles. From the windshield pillar rearward, the 1958 Bel Air Impala differed structurally from the lower-priced Chevrolet models. Hardtops had a slightly shorter [[Greenhouse (automotive)|greenhouse]] and longer rear deck. The wheelbase of the Impala was longer than the lower priced models, although the overall length was identical. Interiors held a two-spoke steering wheel and color-keyed door panels with brushed aluminum trim. No other series included a convertible.

The 1958 Chevrolet models were longer, lower, and wider than its predecessors.&lt;ref name="The Editors of Consumer Guide"&gt;The Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 model year was the first with dual headlamps. The [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] of the 1957 were replaced by deeply sculptured rear fenders. Impalas had three taillights each side, while lesser models had two and wagons just one. The Impalas included crossed-flag insignias above the side moldings, as well as bright rocker moldings and dummy rear-fender scoops.

The standard perimeter-type frame was abandoned, replaced by a unit with rails laid out in the form of an elongated "X." Chevrolet claimed that the new frame offered increased torsional [[Stiffness|rigidity]]&lt;ref name="flory2008"/&gt; and allowed for a lower placement of the passenger compartment. This was a transitional step between traditional construction and the later fully unitized body/chassis, the body structure was strengthened in the rocker panels and firewall.&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet engineering-1958 Chevrolets&lt;/ref&gt; However, this frame was not as effective in protecting the interior structure in a side impact crash, as a traditional perimeter frame.

A coil spring suspension replaced the previous year's rear leaf springs, and an air ride system was optional. A {{convert|283|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} engine was the standard V8, with ratings that ranged from 185 to 290 horsepower. A "W" block (not to be confused with the big-block) {{convert|348|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} Turbo-Thrust V8 was optional, producing {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}}, {{convert|280|hp|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|315|hp|abbr=on}}. The Ramjet fuel injection was available as an option for the Turbo-Fire 283 V8, not popular in 1958.

A total of 55,989 Impala convertibles and 125,480 coupes were built representing 15&amp;nbsp;percent of Chevrolet production. The 1958 Chevrolet Bel Air Impala helped Chevrolet regain the number one production spot in this recession year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The 1959 Chevrolet Impala was redesigned. Sharing bodyshells with lower-end [[Buick]]s and [[Oldsmobile]]s as well as with [[Pontiac]], part of a GM economy move, the Chevrolet's wheelbase was 1-1/2&amp;nbsp;inches longer. Using a new X-frame chassis, the roof line was three inches lower, bodies were two inches wider, and curb weight increased. Its [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] protruded outward, rather than upward. The taillights were a large "teardrop" design at each side, and two slim-wide nonfunctional front air intake scoops were added just above the grille,

The Impala became a separate series, adding a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan, to the two-door Sport Coupe and convertible. Sport Coupes featured a shortened roof line and wrap-over back window. The standard engine was an I6, while the base V8 was the carryover {{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, at {{convert|185|hp|abbr=on}}. Optional were a 283&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in with {{convert|290|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|348|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 up to {{convert|335|hp|abbr=on}}. Standard were front and rear armrests, an electric clock, dual sliding sun visors, and crank-operated front [[Quarter glass|vent windows]]. A contoured hooded instrument panel held deep-set gauges. A six-way power seat was a new option, as was "Speedminder", for the driver to set a needle at a specific speed and a buzzer would sound if the pre-set was exceeded.

The 1960 Impala models reinstated three round taillights on each side, and a white band running along the rear fenders.

The available V8s were reduced to seven, in 283-cu&amp;nbsp;in or 348-cu&amp;nbsp;in displacements. The carbureted Turbo-Fire 283&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in V8 could have either {{convert|170|or|230|hp|abbr=on}}. The 348&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in was available in {{convert|250|to|320|hp|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} Special Super Turbo-Thrust with triple two-barrel carburetors, 11.25:1 compression ratio, and dual exhausts. Fuel injection was no longer an option on full-size Chevrolets.&lt;ref name="The Editors of Consumer Guide"/&gt; New to the options list was [[cruise control|speed and cruise control]].

Production was 490,000 units.

Right-hand drive cars were made in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, for New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa and assembled locally from CKD or SKD kits. The right-hand drive dashboard was a mirror image of the 1959 Chevrolet panel and shared with equivalent right-hand drive Pontiac models. Australian models were assembled by hand on the GMH Holden assembly lines.

=== 1961 ===
[[File:61 Impala.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Impala Sport Coupe]]
The Impala was restyled on the [[GM B platform]] for the first time for 1961. The new body styling was more trim and boxy than the 1958–1960 models. Sport Coupe models featured a "bubbleback" roof line style for 1961, and a unique model, the 2-door pillared sedan, was available for 1961 only. It was rarely ordered. A "Super Sport" (SS) option debuted for 1961. This was also the last year the top station wagon model would have the Nomad name. Power brakes were $43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=standard catalog of American Muscle Cars 1960–1972|year=2006|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-89689-433-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1962 ===
The 1962 model featured new "C" pillar styling for all models except the 4-door hardtop. Sport Coupe models now featured the "convertible roof" styling, shared with other GM "B" [[full-size vehicle|full-size]] hardtop coupes, although the less expensive [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] hardtop was still available with the 1961-style roofline. This style proved popular. The "overhang" roof style of the sedans was replaced with a wider "C" pillar with wraparound rear window. {{Citation needed span|Engine choices for 1962 included the {{convert|348|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}} V8 discontinued and replaced by the {{convert|380|bhp|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|409|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}} or {{convert|409|bhp|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|409|cuin|L|1|adj=on}} engine. |date=September 2018}} These engines could only be ordered with a manual shift transmission. The small-block 283 was offered with a two barrel carburetor. The 283 was also enlarged to {{convert|327|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}}, offered in two versions, one with {{convert|250|bhp|0|abbr=on}} and one with {{convert|300|bhp|0|abbr=on}}, which added more engine choices for small-block fans. [[The Beach Boys]] produced a hit single, ''"[[409 (song)|409]]"'', referring to the Chevrolet, which became an iconic song for these cars. Impalas again featured premium interior appointments, plusher seats could be done by the dealerships on customer request. And more chrome trim outside, including a full-width aluminum-and-chrome panel to house the triple-unit taillight assembly. [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport (SS) models]] featured that panel in a special engine-turned aluminum, which was also used to fill the side moldings, making the SS more distinctive in appearance. The Impala also gained the top trim station wagon body design, in place of the Chevrolet Nomad model. However, unlike the passenger cars, Impala wagons had dual-unit taillights. Due to reliability problems, the optional Turboglide automatic transmission was discontinued, leaving [[Powerglide]] the only [[automatic transmission]] available until 1965. A new radio was optional.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1962"/&gt;

=== 1963 ===
[[File:63 Impala SS.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Impala SS Hardtop Sport Coupe]]

The 1963 Impala featured rectilinear styling with an engine-turned aluminum rear taillight panel surrounded by a chrome border on SS models. Engine choice was similar to 1962, with the small-block {{convert|283|and|327|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}} V8s most popular. The Sport Sedan featured a new, creased roof line. A new "coved" instrument panel with simple indicator lights for hot and cold engine conditions. An optional factory tachometer was built into the dashboard, just above the steering wheel; it was rarely ordered. Impala wagons got triple-unit taillights for the first time.

A special 427-cubic-inch (7.0 L) version of the 409 engine was used in the 1963 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe, ordered under Chevrolet Regular Production Option (RPO) Z11. This was a special package created for drag racers, as well as NASCAR, and it consisted of a 427 cubic inch engine with aluminum body parts, and a cowl-induction air intake system. The aluminum body parts were fabricated in Flint, Michigan at the facility now known as GM Flint Metal Center. Unlike the later, second-generation 427, it was based on the W-series 409 engine, but with a longer 3.65 in (93&amp;nbsp;mm) stroke. A high-rise, two-piece aluminum intake manifold and dual Carter AFB carburetors fed a 13.5:1 compression ratio to produce an under-rated{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} 430&amp;nbsp;hp (320&amp;nbsp;kW) and 575&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (780 N·m) of torque. 50 RPO Z11 cars were produced at the Flint GM plant.

=== 1964 ===
[[File:1964 Chevrolet Impala Sports Coupe (21132744389).jpg|left|thumb|1964 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupé. This car has 1965 Super Sport wheel covers.]]
For 1964, the Impala was restyled to a more rounded, softer look. The signature taillight assembly had an "upside-down U" shaped aluminum trim strip above the taillights, but the individual lights were surrounded by a body-colored panel. The [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#409|{{convert|409|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine]] returned as the big-block option, as well as the [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] 2X4-barrel [[carburetor]]s setup for the {{cvt|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm and {{cvt|425|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,200 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1964/384605/chevrolet_impala_sport_coupe_409_v-8_turbo-fire_425-hp_4-speed_close.html|title=1964 Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe 409 V-8 Turbo-Fire 425 HP 4-speed close|website=automobile-catalog|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SS models continued to feature the engine-turned aluminum trim. Rooflines were carried over from 1963 unchanged. Back-up lights were standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1964_Chevrolet/1964_Chevrolet_Full_Line_Brochure/1964%20Chevrolet%20Full-04-05.html |title=1964 Chevrolet Full Line Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All full size 1964 Chevrolet station wagons got small rectangular taillight lenses mounted vertically, one for each side of the car.

=== Exports ===
Right hand drive cars were made at GM's [[Oshawa]] plant in Canada and often shipped overseas in kit form for assembly in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The RHD cars&amp;nbsp;— Chevrolet or equivalent Pontiac (built on Chevrolet frames and using Chevrolet engines in Canada)&amp;nbsp;— all used a right hand drive version of the [[left hand drive]] 1961 Pontiac dashboard.

Redesigned in 1965, the Impala set an all-time industry annual sales record of more than 1 million units in the United States. All new full-size Chevrolets eschewed the "X" frame for a full-width perimeter frame, a new body that featured curved, frameless side glass (for pillarless models), sharper angled windshield with newly reshaped vent windows, and redesigned full-coil suspension.

[[File:66 Impala SS convt.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Impala SS Convertible]]

In 1965, Chevrolet introduced a new luxury package for the Impala four-door hardtop, called "Caprice" and coded as RPO Z18. Caprices received tufted upholstery, wood grained accents on the dashboard and specialty pulls on the insides of the doors. This [[halo model|"halo" model]] also featured the "spinner" wheel covers from the Impala SS, with the "SS" logo centers replaced by a Chevrolet "bowtie" emblem. The Super Sport's blackout rear trim strip below the triple taillights was also used, with the "Impala SS" emblem replaced by a large "Caprice by Chevrolet" badge. The Impala block lettering on each front fender was replaced with "Caprice" script. The Caprice package was reintroduced as the Chevrolet Caprice Custom in 1966, taking the top position in the full-size Chevrolet lineup.

Engine choices included the [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine|inline six-cylinder]] as well as the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|small-block]] and [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|big-block]] V8s. A new three-range Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission was optional for {{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8. The old {{convert|409|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} "W" engine was discontinued early in the 1965 model year, so early-production 1965s got the 409, as well as 1/10 of 1% had the 396 CID big-block. Other later-built cars had the {{convert|396|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} as the big-block option. Two-speed Powerglide, as well as 3- and 4-speed manual transmissions were available. As with previous years, Impalas featured more chrome trim inside and out, with pleated tufted upholstery and door panels. The Impala would be the #2-selling convertible in the US in 1966, with 38,000 sold; it was beaten by the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1964–1966|Mustang]] by almost 2:1.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.412.&lt;/ref&gt; 1966 saw a pair of enlarged big-block V8s featuring {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. The RPO L36 was rated at {{convert|385|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, the L72 at {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The L72 was only available with a manual transmission.

The 1967 model was redesigned with enhanced [[Coke bottle styling]] that featured Corvette-inspired front and rear fender bulges. The curves were the most pronounced with the 1967–1968 models. In keeping with federal regulations, safety features were built into Impalas during the 1967 and 1968 model years, including a fully collapsible energy-absorbing steering column, side marker lights, and shoulder belts for closed models. The L72 engine was not available in 1967, but a L36 Turbo-Jet V8 was optional.
[[File:68 Impala.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Impala Sport Coupe]]

The 1968 model was facelifted with a new front end. The new rear bumper housed triple "horseshoe" shaped taillights. 1968 also saw a new Impala model, the Custom Coupe. This two-door hardtop featured the same formal roofline as the Caprice Coupe. It was successful and would be continued right through 1976. The L72 "427 Turbo-Jet" engine was once again returned to the option list, a solid-lifter V8 rated at {{convert|425|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. It would continue to be available for both 1968 and 1969, replaced by the Turbo-Jet 454 for 1970.

The 1969 Impala and other full-sized Chevrolets got new slab-sided bodies with a small "upsweep" at the rear quarter window, giving them a more formal appearance. It retained the 119-inch wheelbase from previous models. New front bumpers that wrapped around the grille and horizontal taillights were in the rear bumper. The hardtop Sport Coupe got a new notchback roofline, replacing the "fastback" C-pillar from 1967 to 1968. Ventless front windows were used on all models. Chevrolet had a rudimentary "power vent" system featuring vents in the instrument panel. The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and when the key was removed, the steering wheel and shift lever were locked.

The 1969 model year Impala production topped Caprice production by 611,000 units. Impala station wagons were renamed Kingswood, a name which would continue through 1972. The similar 1970 Impala got a minor facelift featuring a more conventional under the grille bumper replacing the wrap-around unit used in 1969 along with new triple vertical taillights in the rear bumper. Canadian buyers got the choice of a lower priced companion to the Impala Sport Coupe, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, which used the same body but featured Bel Air trim.

===Exports===
Right hand drive cars were manufactured in Canada for export to countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, etc., until 1969. They used a version of the 1965 Impala dash panel&amp;nbsp;— without provision for a radio and installed in a dashboard moulding made of fibreglass, not metal&amp;nbsp;— until 1969. Radios (centrally mounted) and heaters were locally sourced and wipers parked in the center of the windscreen. Australian models were assembled in Australia from kits, as this lessened tax on the cars. The Australian cars had locally sourced amber flashing rear indicators replacing the clear reversing lenses, as red indicators were illegal. For New Zealand assembly, the bodies were supplied from Canada already welded, painted and trimmed.

===Impala SS (1961–1969)===
In a December 17, 1960 press release Chevrolet Motor Division introduced the Impala [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]] (Super Sport) option to the market. The SS badge was to become Chevrolet's signature of performance on many models, though it often has been an appearance package only. The Impala's factory SS package in 1961 was truly a performance package when so equipped from the factory with both the trim and "mandatory" suspension and engine upgrades, beginning with the {{convert|348|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] engines available with {{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} or the new {{convert|409|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, which in 1961 was rated at {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Unlike all other years, the 1961 Super Sport package was available on any Impala, including sedans and station wagons (the sales brochure shows a 4-door hardtop Sport Sedan with the SS package). The package also included upgraded tires on [[station wagon]] wheels, springs, shocks and special [[Powder metallurgy|sintered]] metallic brake linings. Only 142 1961 Impala Super Sports came from the factory with the 409. In addition to the factory-installed SS package, Chevrolet dealers could add SS trim to any standard Impala without the "mandatory" performance upgrades, and a number of '61s were so equipped.

Starting for the 1962 model year, the Impala SS was an appearance package limited to hardtop coupe and convertible coupe models, available with all engines in the Impala series starting with the base {{convert|235|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|135|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} inline-6 through 1967, though the big-block engines and heavy-duty parts could still be ordered. From 1967 to 1969, an additional model, the SS427, was available.

[[File:64 Impala SS.jpg|thumb|1964 Impala Super Sport Coupe]]
[[File:1965 Chevrolet Impala Super Sport Coupe (1).JPG|thumb|1965 Chevrolet Impala Super Sport Coupe]]

The Super Sport was known as Regular Production Option (RPO) Z03, from 1962 to 1963, and again in 1968. From 1964 through 1967, the Super Sport was a separate model, with its own VIN prefix (for V8 models, 168 versus the 164 for the regular Impala). Super Sports from 1962 to 1964 came with engine-turned aluminum trim, which was replaced by a "blackout" trim strip in 1965 which ran under the taillights. 1965 Super Sport exteriors differed only slightly from regular Impalas. Rocker panel trim was deleted. "Super Sport" scripts replaced the "Impala" fender badges. The new center console housed a rally-type electric clock, and full instrumentation now included a vacuum gauge. A total of 243,114 Impala SS coupes and convertibles were built for 1965.

The 1966 Impala SS was facelifted with a revised grille and new rectangular taillights that replaced the triple round units. A chrome beltline strip shared with regular Impalas was added in response to complaints about door dings on the clean-lined 1965s. Inside were new "Strato-bucket" front seats with thinner and higher seat backs, and a center console with an optional gauge package available. Sales of the 1966 Impala SS dropped by more than 50% to around 117,000 units; this was mainly due to the sport/performance car market switching from full-sized models to intermediates (including Chevrolet's own [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] SS396 and [[Pontiac GTO]]), along with the emerging market for the even smaller pony car market created by the [[Ford Mustang]] in 1964 that Chevrolet would respond to with the [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] for 1967.

The 1967 Impala SS was less decorated than other Impalas; Super Sports had black grille accents and black-accented body-side and rear fender moldings. Lesser models leaned more toward brightwork inside and out. Buyers could choose either vinyl bucket seats with a center console, or a Strato-Bench seat with a fold-down center armrest. Standard wheel covers were the same as the optional full covers on other big Chevrolets, but the centers featured the "SS" logo surrounded by tri-color ring of red, white and blue. "Chevrolet" and "Impala" callouts on the body were all replaced by "Impala SS" badges. Of the 76,055 Impala SS models built, just 2,124 were ordered with RPO Z24, a special performance package that included RPO F41 heavy-duty suspension and other performance features, RPO L36 ({{convert|385|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}) Turbo-Jet {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, as well as a special trim package that replaced the "Impala SS" badges with large "SS427" emblems on the front grille and rear trim. None of these cars had the name "Impala" anywhere on the body or interior, and Chevrolet often marketed them as the "Chevrolet SS427," ''sans'' the "Impala" name. The Z24 package also included a special hood with fake chrome-plated intake. Only about 400 Super Sports had a six-cylinder engine from 1967 to 1968, {{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in 1969, or L72 ({{convert|425|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}) from 1968 to 1969. Special SS427 badging, inside and out, was the rule, but few were sold, since muscle car enthusiasts were seeking big-block intermediates, such as the [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] SS396 and [[Plymouth Road Runner]].

In 1968 as Caprice sales escalated, those of the Impala Super Sport suffered a decline. Much of this drop in sales was no doubt due to the availability of big-block engines in the mid-sized (and lighter) Chevelle, and even Novas could be special-ordered with the 396 engine with the new-for-1968 body. No longer a separate series, the Super Sport was a mere $179 option package (Regular Production Option Z03) for the two Impala coupes and the convertible. Only 38,210 Impalas were so-equipped, including 1,778 with the Z24 package, which was carried over from 1967. In 1968 only, SS427s could be ordered without the Z03 SS package, which meant SS427 equipment but no bucket seats, SS door panels, or center console. The Z03 Impala SS could be identified by "Impala Super Sport" badges on the front grille, rear fenders and trunk lid. Z24-optioned cars included "SS427" emblems to replace the "Impala Super Sport" badges, a special layered "pancake" hood, and three "gills" mounted on the front fender aft of the wheel well ''à la'' Corvette Stingray.

In 1969, the Impala SS was available only as the Z24 (SS427), coming exclusively with a {{convert|427|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 of {{convert|335|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|425|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. This was the final year for the Impala SS until 1994. Unlike the previous two years, the 1969s finally got "Impala" script on the front fenders and interior. The 1969 Impala SS had no distinctive SS badging inside the car except for an "SS" logo the steering wheel (again, there was no Z03 offered that year). Like the 1968s, the Z24 could be ordered on the Impala convertible, Sport Coupe, or Custom Coupe. 1969 was the last year that the Impala SS was offered with the Z24 package, but the only year in which front disc brakes and {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels were standard; that made the 1969 SS427 mechanically better than the previous versions in standard form. Although sales of 1969 Z24-optioned Impalas increased to approximately 2,455 units from the 1,778 Z03-optioned units of 1968, and high-powered big-block V8 engines continued to be available, there would be no Impala SS for 1970. The 427 was also replaced on the engine offerings list by a new Turbo-Jet 454 producing {{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}

The 1965–1970 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].

The Impala remained Chevrolet's top-selling model with the fifth generation. A high-performance big block V8 was still available in the form of the Turbo-Jet 454, which produced {{convert|365|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in 1971, but power decreased as the years went along. The 1971 redesigned [[B-body]] would be the largest car ever offered by Chevrolet. The hardtop Sport Coupe continued to be offered; it was a smoothly sloped semi-fastback reminiscent of the 1961 "bubbletop" styling. A three-speed manual transmission remained standard at the beginning of the year, but in the spring of 1971 all V8-equipped full-size GM cars got Turbo Hydra-Matic as standard equipment. Powerglide remained optionally available for six-cylinder cars until the 1973 models. In keeping with their huge size, these new "B" body Chevrolets were close to Cadillac in luxury features, styling, and ride. Like all GM "B" bodied cars, Impala got a new power ventilation system that remained on while the ignition was on, and included both large vents in the instrument panel and louvers in the trunk. However, the system proved to be problematic and was disliked by many buyers.  Power assisted front disc brakes were standard for all models for 1971; variable-ratio power steering became standard in 1972 

[[File:Chevrolet Impala 1972 (14106775621).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Chevrolet Impala 4-door hardtop (Sport Sedan)]]
The 1972 model has a grille which extended below the bumper. Powertrains consisted of mostly V8 engines. The 250 inline six was still standard for Sport Coupe and 4-door sedan models; the 350 2bbl V8 became the standard engine from 1973–1976, with {{convert|350|cuin|L|sigfig=2}}, {{convert|400|cuin|L|sigfig=2}}, {{convert|402|cuin|L|sigfig=2}} (through 72) or {{convert|454|cuin|L|sigfig=2}} optional. The best-selling body style was the formal-roof Custom Coupe. Beginning in 1972, all engines were designed to run on [[unleaded gasoline]]. 1972 saw the last Impala convertible; it sold 6,456 units, placing fourth with just under 9 percent of the market, right behind the [[Chevrolet Corvette C3|Corvette]]'s 6,508 units sold, ahead of the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]]'s 6,401 units sold.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.865.&lt;/ref&gt; The power ventilation system was improved, and exit vents were moved from the trunk lid to the door pillars.

All 1973 Chevrolet vehicles featured a larger, shock-absorbing front bumper due to new federal mandates which required {{convert|5|mph|adj=on}} impact protection. New taillights were mounted in the (still) conventional rear bumper. The convertible was moved upmarket to the Caprice Classic series. Tweaks to the suspension and frame gave better roadability, according to Chevrolet general manager [[John Z. DeLorean]]. Steering wheels and instrument panels were color-keyed to interior colors, as opposed to the matte black used in 1971–1972. The steering wheel rim got a soft-feel grip, and replaced the "Impala" badge with generic "Chevrolet." The inline six-cylinder engine was now offered on the Bel Air 4-door sedan only, and only with the 3-speed manual transmission. Interiors had repositioned front seats for more legroom. The Impala name returned for the Kingswood station wagon. Suspension and chassis design was modified for better roadability.  The bench front seat position was modified to fit tall drivers more comfortably; shorter drivers found it less so.

One thousand 1973 Impalas were built with an "Air Cushion Restraint System" (ACRS) that used an Oldmobile instrument panel and unique steering wheel that contained both a driver and front passenger air bag. They were all four-door sedans painted in a special green-gold color. The system was not advertised in a big way and many of the cars were used for crash testing by both GM and the Federal government. Over the decades the system proved durable and successfully protected front passengers in front-end collisions. Unfortunately Chevy did not offer ACRS in 1974; however it was offered in Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac models that year as an option and did save lives. One ACRS-equipped Impala was preserved and remains a witness to the ability of an American automaker to design life saving safety systems into cars without a government mandate. No other examples are known as of this time.

In 1974, the rear bumper was redesigned with shock absorbers to meet the upgraded standards and new tail lights were featured. The front end was also freshened as in previous years, with a new grille and headlight bezels, a new header panel, and a bumper with a drop down center section. The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps once again. This was the only year of the 1971–1976 models the Impala had a different front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two. The rooflines of the Impala coupes were also revised. For 1974 the Custom Coupe was no longer a hardtop, with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B-pillar. The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down quarter glass like that of the 1971–1973 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, fastback style, flat back window. Sedans used carryover body shells from previous years.  In an unusual styling move, the optional Impala wheel covers for 1974 were the same as the 1970 Impala's.

[[File:A92 (24193061739).jpg|thumb|1976 Impala 4-door sedan]]

A limited-edition Spirit of America package was offered in 1974 on Sport Coupe models; primarily an appearance package, it featured white or blue body paint, a white full vinyl top, white upholstery with red or blue trim, color-keyed seat belts and floormats, special wheel covers, optional white [[rally wheels]], sports-styled dual remote outside rear view mirrors, a vinyl body side molding insert, and red pin-striping. Special fender and dashboard badges announced the package to passers-by and passengers. Chevrolet also offered [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova]] and [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]] Spirit of America versions as well.

The 1975 Impala used a 1974 carried-over Caprice front end, with a grille insert and emblem change. The Caprice model was revised with a new front end with a swept back style header panel with recessed headlight buckets, a new hood, and new fenders. Also in 1975 upholstery, door panels and the dashboard were revised as were the radio and climate control graphics. Speedometers read up to {{convert|100|mph||abbr=on}}, and added kilometers per hour. A [[High energy ignition|High Energy Ignition]] (HEI) system was officially introduced in 1975, although it was installed on some 1974 cars as a clandestine option. [[Catalytic converters]] were also introduced, as were several new options, including an Econominder gauge package (which also included a coolant temperature gauge), intermittent wipers, and a divided 50/50 bench seat with passenger-side recliner (with a choice of sport cloth or vinyl trim). This was the final year of the full-size Chevrolet convertible. Four-door models got new rooflines; the hardtop Sport Sedan got a small triangular "opera window" carved out of the wide roof panel.

A Landau model available for 1975–1976 models featured a [[Landau (automobile)|landau]] [[vinyl roof]] (with a chrome band across the roof), a choice of special paint colors, sports-styled dual remote outside rearview mirrors, color-keyed wheel covers, a vinyl bodyside molding insert, and pin-striping. Inside were color-keyed seat belts and floormats. Fender and dashboard emblems rounded out the package. The 2-door hardtop model (dubbed the "Sport Coupe") was discontinued after 1975, leaving redesigned Custom Coupe, with its wide "B" pillar and fixed rear window, the only 2-door Impala available in 1976. This body style had been introduced for the 1974 model year, a precursor to Detroit's complete abandonment of pillarless body styles before the end of the Seventies. 1976 Impalas used a previous year Caprice nose, with a new "egg crate" grille insert. The Impala had round headlamps while the Caprice used the new quad rectangular ones.  For fleet buyers, Chevrolet offered a lower priced Impala "S" model that deleted some of the standard model's luxury features, such as radial tires, sound insulation and trunk light.  The "S" was available in both a 4-door sedan and station wagon, and effectively replaced the [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] for the U.S. market (the Bel Air continued in production in Canada until 1981).

The changes in the automobile marketplace resulted in Chevrolet redesigning the Impala once again in 1976 to meet changing demands. The new [[downsize (automobile)|downsized]] Impalas were shorter in length, taller and narrower than before. The new Impala's frame was a shortened version of the one introduced in 1970 and would be utilized until 1996 when the B-body production line was shut down. Even with its trimmer exterior dimensions, the new Impala featured increased headroom, rear-seat legroom and trunk space.&lt;ref&gt;1978 Chevrolet Full Size brochure&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the downsized model increased substantially over 1976, and the Impala regained the number one US sales position. The redesigned 1977 Impala/Caprice was named ''[[Motor Trend]]''{{'s}} car of the year. The new body was taller and narrower than the 1976 model.

Pillarless hardtops were discontinued, the result of rumors of federal rollover standards looming in the near future. The 1977–1979 coupes sported a double bent tempered rear window similar to the 1987 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] Aerocoupe. In 1980, all new sheet-metal was used, although the body style remained similar.

Engine availability was reduced for 1977; the [[inline-6]] was reintroduced with {{convert|110|HP||abbr=on}}. Options included {{convert|267|and|305|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}} V8 engines. The {{convert|350|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}} V8 engine was optional in some years. [[Oldsmobile]]'s {{convert|350|cuin|L|adj=on|sigfig=2}} V8 [[diesel engine]] also was available. Starting in 1980, the inline 6 was replaced by a generic 229 cubic-inch V6 from Chevrolet which was totally different from the 3.8 liter (231 cubic inch) V6 from [[Buick]] that was installed in numerous GM models of different divisions.

The Impala and the upscale Caprice sold well into the early 1980s. The Impala was reduced to the base model full-size Chevrolet and was popular with fleet usage&amp;nbsp;– including taxi and police-pursuit vehicles, but had coupe and wagon body styles dropped after 1981 and was discontinued in 1985, while the Caprice continued unchanged until 1990. Upon the demise of the Impala, the base model full-size Chevrolet was rebranded Caprice starting in 1986, with the upper models being called the Caprice Classic and Caprice Classic Brougham.

In January 1990, the GM B platform was redesigned for the 1991 model year, though it retained the same shortened [[Chassis|frame]] design of the 1977 model year redesign. The Impala SS badge was resurrected at the 1992 [[Detroit Auto Show]] as a concept car designed by GM designer Jon Moss. The concept car was two inches lower to the ground than the regular Caprice, and was powered by a {{convert|8.2|L|cuin|sp=us|adj=on}} engine. Eventually, the concept car's engine was replaced with a {{convert|5.7|L|cuin|sp=us|adj=on}} engine derived from the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]].

The 1994 Impala SS went into production on February 14, 1994, at GM's plant in [[Arlington, Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.motortrend.com/news/performance-trends-15/ Motor Trend]''&lt;/ref&gt; and was almost identical cosmetically to the concept car, the only noticeable change being the chromed bowtie logo on the grill (vs. a red logo on the concept). The car was, in essence, a high-performance version of the Caprice. It used the Caprice [[9C1]] police package as its base and as such got most of the equipment formerly available only to law enforcement and government agencies. This included a sport-tuned suspension with reinforced shocks and springs, a high-capacity reverse-flow cooling system (derived from the Corvette's LT1), four-wheel disc brakes, transmission cooler, dual exhaust, a higher-output electrical system, and other minor mechanical alterations. {{citation needed span|The Impala SS did not get the external oil-to-air engine oil cooler, nor were all the body mounts secured (the standard Caprice and Impala SS were assembled at the factory with the front three body mounts missing one of the rubber cushions, while the 9C1 was assembled with all rubber cushions in place).|date=February 2016}}

The Impala SS was fitted with a standard 3.08 gear. The limited-slip rear differential was standard (as opposed to the option G80 on Caprices) and the suspension was an inch lower. A retuned [[GM LT engine#LT1|LT1]] {{convert|5.7|L|cuin|sp=us|adj=on}} [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|small-block]] V8 was standard on the Impala SS, making {{convert|260|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lb.ft|N·m|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] (retuned from the prototype's {{convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} rating). The primary difference between the LT1 in the Impala and the LT1 that was in the Corvette and Camaro was that the Impala engine was fitted with cast-iron cylinder heads instead of aluminum ones, and a camshaft that was designed more for low-end torque than high-end horsepower. Another difference was that the block casting for the Impala LT1 had two-bolt main bearing caps while the casting used for the Corvette LT1 had four-bolt main bearing caps. The transmission was the [[GM 4L60-E transmission|4L60E]], which was an electronically controlled version of the previously hydraulically controlled 4L60. {{Citation needed span|However, the transmission was not beefed up for the power of the LT1, and transmission failures after {{convert|100000|mi}} were commonplace.|date=September 2007}}

The Impala SS received body-colored trim, a unique single-bar grille with no hood ornament, and a rear deck spoiler. It was fitted with {{convert|17|in|mm|adj=on}} brushed aluminum wheels with 255/50ZR17 all-season Z-rated tires. Inside, the car came with a central console with cup holders (1994 and 1995 models) and a storage compartment, leather seats embroidered with the Impala SS logo, and a standard leather-wrapped steering wheel. For the 1994 model year, it was available only in black with a gray interior. Due to a shortage of the unique five-spoke aluminum wheels, only 6,303 cars were sold. However, the wheel shortage was remedied for the 1995 model year and 21,434 cars were sold.

In 1995, Dark Cherry Metallic and Dark Grey Green were added as exterior color options, and the body paneling on the rear [[quarter panel]] was altered to reflect the cosmetic effect formerly achieved by a window insert. Another change from 1994 was the placement of the side mirrors from pods attached to the door to a larger format attached to the 'A' pillar. 1996 was the last year of production with 41,941 units sold. The 1996 Impala SS was also exported to the Middle East as the Caprice SS with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the rear quarter panel and the badge on the dashboard saying ''Caprice SS''. The 1996 Impala SS production went late into the model year; the last one being produced on December 13, 1996. It saw minor interior alterations, with the digital speedometer being replaced by an analog one, along with a tachometer. The shifter was moved from the column to the center console, and the engine was given an OBD-II computer control system (the camshaft was reground to adjust for the new computer).

===Discontinuation===
The entire B-body line, consisting of the [[Chevrolet Caprice]], Impala SS, and [[Buick Roadmaster]], was discontinued, as GM wanted more assembly lines to be able to produce the more profitable SUVs. A ceremony was held at the plant on December 13, 1996, as the last Impala SS was produced.&lt;ref name="lastss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pgctv.com/videos/thelastss/ |title=Friday the 13th |publisher=Pacific/Gulf Coast Productions |date=December 13, 1996 |accessdate=July 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327072336/http://pgctv.com/videos/thelastss/ |archivedate=March 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Impala name was revived for the 2000 model year as the "[[Mid-size|Hi-Mid]]" program to rename the [[Chevrolet Lumina|Lumina]] as the Chevy Impala.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} Based on the Lumina's [[GM W platform|W-body]] platform, it was built at [[Oshawa Car Assembly]] in [[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada. Unlike the earlier Impalas built on a [[GM B platform|B-body]], this one was [[front-wheel drive]] and was available with a choice of two engines, the ever-enduring 3.8L V6 engine, and the slightly smaller 3.4L V6 engine. A new Impala SS with a [[supercharged]] V6 was brought out for the 2004 model year.

[[File:2002 Chevrolet Impala.jpg|left|thumb|2002 Impala]]

The Impala was available in two trim levels from 2000 to 2003. The base model came equipped with cloth bench seats, steel wheels, the {{convert|180|hp|0|abbr=}} 3.4 liter (204 cu in) ''LA1'' [[V6]], and a 3-gauge instrument cluster.&lt;ref name="LA1specs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/division/2005_prodinfo/powertrain/engines/05_car_engine_specs.html#la1|title=GM Powertrain Car Engines 2005 |publisher=Media.gm.com |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325093634/http://media.gm.com/division/2005_prodinfo/powertrain/engines/05_car_engine_specs.html#la1 |archivedate = March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''LS'' came factory-equipped with cloth bucket seats upgradeable to leather with center console and floor shift, color-keyed "Impala" door scripts and trunk badge, [[anti-lock brakes]], [[traction control system]], keyless remote entry, integrated foglamps, aluminum wheels upgradeable to alloy wheels, rear spoiler (optional on the base models), 4-gauge instrument cluster (with tachometer), and the larger {{convert|200|hp|0|abbr=}} 3.8 liter (231 cu in) ''L36'' V6.&lt;ref name="L36specs"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://media.gm.com/division/2005_prodinfo/powertrain/engines/05_car_engine_specs.html#l26|title=GM Powertrain Car Engines 2005 |publisher=Media.gm.com |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325093634/http://media.gm.com/division/2005_prodinfo/powertrain/engines/05_car_engine_specs.html#l26 |archivedate = March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Options available on all models included a sunroof, OnStar system, Driver Information Center with built-in [[HomeLink Wireless Control System|HomeLink system]], heated power front seats, and 16&amp;nbsp;inch 1990s SS-inspired wheels. All models came equipped with power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The rear spoiler was an option on base models, and could be deleted from LS models upon buyers request. 

The 2004 to 2005 Impala SS came equipped with the 3.8 liter (231 cu in) supercharged ''L67'' [[V6]] engine.&lt;ref name="L67specs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/division/2005_prodinfo/powertrain/engines/05_car_engine_specs.html#l32 |title=GM Powertrain Car Engines 2005 |publisher=Media.gm.com |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325093634/http://media.gm.com/division/2005_prodinfo/powertrain/engines/05_car_engine_specs.html#l32 |archivedate = March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rated at {{convert|240|hp}} and had been previously used in the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] ''GTP'', [[Buick Regal]] ''GS'', [[Buick Riviera]], and [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]] [[Pontiac Bonneville]] ''SSEI'' and [[Buick Park Avenue]] "Ultra". The lighter front-wheel-drive sedan was as quick as the vaunted 1990s Impala SS, with {{convert|0|-|60|mph|adj=on}} times pushing 6.5 seconds, compared to the earlier model's time also showing 6.5 seconds (albeit 7.1 seconds on average).&lt;ref&gt;Car and Driver (June 1994 issue) https://www.caranddriver.com/archives/1994-chevrolet-impala-ss-archived-instrumented-test&lt;br&gt;See inside PDF reference&lt;/ref&gt; To commemorate Chevrolet's long relationship with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500 race, a limited edition (4,088 produced) Impala Indy SS was offered in 2004, featuring black grille with gold Chevrolet bowtie emblem that would be carried over to all Impala models in 2005, various Indy logos on the exterior and interior, 17-inch chrome wheels, gauge cluster package, and more.

===Impala 9C1 and 9C3===
[[File:Chevy-Impala-police.jpg|left|thumb|2005 Impala 9C1 4dr Police Interceptor]]
Also released with this version were the [[police car|Police Package]] first released in 2000 and Undercover Police Package first released in 2001, named ''9C1'' and ''9C3'', respectively. Available only to law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and EMS agencies, it has had much more success than its predecessor, the [[Chevrolet Lumina|Lumina]] 9C3. The 9C1 was a base model with a stronger suspension and the 3.8 liter (231 cu in) V6 engine. It also came with the option for a rear vinyl bench seat and front cloth bucket or bench seats, both cloth front and rear seats, or vinyl front and rear seats. It also offered preparation for a criminal cage to be installed between the front and rear seats. It was only available in a few basic colors. Another addition was the "SURV MODE" switch that replaced the fog light switch found on the LS. This enabled the driver to turn off all lights in the vehicle and "hide"; something not allowed with the civilian models, as automatic headlights were standard. The 9C3 was comparably equipped to the 9C1, but the ability to add other convenience options and more paint and interior choices set the 9C3 apart.

The Impalas 9C1 and 9C3 sales were strong with law enforcement and were especially popular with large city fleets such as the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] and [[Philadelphia Police Department]]. However, the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor|Ford Crown Victoria P71]] still held the sales lead and was preferred by most agencies due to its larger size and much more durable [[V8 engine]] and [[rear wheel drive]] layout.

The base engine was a 3.5&amp;nbsp;L (214 cu in) [[V6 engine|V6]] producing {{convert|211|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|214|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000 rpm.&lt;ref name="2006ChevyImpalaLSSedanSpecs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/impala/2006/features-specs.html|title=2006 Chevrolet Impala Features &amp; Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Impala featured new taillights, different from the four-circle style of the previous generation. This Impala mostly sold to fleet operators, with private buyers accounting for a quarter of sales.&lt;ref name=aolreview&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130529161950/http://autos.aol.com/cars-Chevrolet-Impala-2014/expert-review/ | url=http://autos.aol.com/cars-Chevrolet-Impala-2014/expert-review/ |title=2014 Chevrolet Impala |publisher=AOL |archivedate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''SS'' model used the [[GM LS engine|Generation IV small-block]] [[V8 engine|V8]], the first to do so in a front-wheel-drive Chevrolet, and the first V8 in a Chevrolet sedan since the 1996 Caprice. The 5.3&amp;nbsp;L (325 cu in) V8 (with [[Displacement on Demand]], called Active Fuel Management or AFM) produced {{convert|303|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="LS4specs"&gt;[http://media.gm.com/us/powertrain/en/product_services/2008/Spec%20Sheet/Gen%20IV/2008%20Gen%20IV%20Car/08_LS4.xls]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of the 5.3&amp;nbsp;L LS4 V8, the Impala SS is capable of a 5.6 second {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on|adj=on}} time and a quarter-mile time of 14.2 seconds traveling at {{convert|101|mph||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/family_four_doors/2006_chevrolet_impala_ss_road_test+page-4.html 2006 Chevrolet Impala SS&amp;nbsp;– Road Test / Family Four Doors / Car Shopping / Hot Lists / Reviews &amp;nbsp;– Car And Driver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101145055/http://media.caranddriver.com/files/2006-chevrolet-impala-ss2006-chevrolet-impala-ss-specs.pdf |date=January 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth generation Impala was {{convert|200.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|58.7|in|0|abbr=on}} high, and {{convert|72.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide with a drag coefficient of 0.33.

[[File:'07 (8th gen) Chevy Impala LTZ (2).JPG|thumb|left|Pre-facelift Chevrolet Impala LTZ]]

Available trim levels for the ninth generation were the LS, LT, LTZ, and the SS, respectively. Six-passenger seating was only available as an option on the LS and LT models. Leather upholstery was standard on LTZ models and optional on LT models. The ninth generation Impala featured a wood trim center console with chrome accents on all major control buttons. The dashboard featured a chrome Impala logo embedded in the wood grain trim that runs across the dashboard and onto the doors. The control knobs found throughout the vehicle's cockpit were similar to those found in Buick models as well as the [[Cadillac DTS]], all of which featured a similar center console. Another interior revision was the location of the cup holders, which were moved beneath the midsection of the vehicle's center console.

The LS was the base model. It offered steel wheels with wheel covers (later alloy wheels), an AM/FM stereo with single-disc (six-disc optional) CD player and MP3 capability, SiriusXM, auxiliary input jack, six speakers, keyless entry, air conditioning, cloth seating surfaces, and a choice of two front bucket or a single front bench seat. The LT was the mid-range model. It offered alloy wheels, and optional front heated seats. The LTZ was the most luxurious model. It offered leather seating surfaces that were heated, an AM/FM stereo with CD/MP3 capability (six-disc optional), SiriusXM, a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] eight-speaker premium sound system, a power sunroof, security system, and [[OnStar]]. The SS was the top-of-the-line model until 2009. It offered a 5.3&amp;nbsp;L V8 engine, leather-and-suede seating surfaces, eighteen-inch machined-finished alloy wheels, and SS badging (The 2006–09 model was the first Impala with a V8 engine since 1996). Due to its unpopularity, the SS trim was discontinued in 2009, leaving the LTZ as the top-of-the-line model for 2010 to be the most powerful, and for a shorter time in 2012–2013, the LS, LT, and LTZ trims were 300 horsepower, and also on the Impala Limited from 2014–2016.

===2007===
In 2007, the Impala received the [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|FlexFuel]] 3.5-liter V6 and Flex Fuel rear badge for the LS, LT, LTZ, and Touring. A new 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 with [[Active Fuel Management]] was available. The SS retained the same drivetrain and did not receive the FlexFuel feature due to the high-performance nature of the powertrain. A tire-pressure-monitoring system, cruise control and a CD player were standard on all models, and a factory spoiler was an available option. The LT had 16-inch, five-spoke alloy wheels. The generation-7 OnStar system with [[turn-by-turn navigation]] was included when the available directions and connections service was selected. The SS had standard leather-appointed seats and [[XM Satellite Radio]], with XM being optional on LS, LT, and LTZ trims. A new Luxury Edition package featuring leather seating, folding rear seat, and rear spoiler was offered on the LT. There were four new exterior colors—Precisions Red, Imperial Blue Metallic, Bordeaux Red, and Red Jewel Tintcoat, as well as a Regency-outfitted "Impala RSS". The RSS included aggressive wheels, front/rear bumper and rocker panel extensions, a spoiler and various interior upgrades.

===2008===
To commemorate the Impala's 50th year, a 50th Anniversary Edition was introduced in Spring 2008. Based on the LT, it added a FE3 Sport Suspension (replacing the FE1 Touring Suspension), four-wheel ABS, eighteen-inch SS-style alloy wheels (replacing the 16-inch wheels), rear SS style spoiler, "50th Anniversary" Impala badges on the C-pillars, two-tone, leather-trimmed seats with "50th" logos embroidered on the front headrests, eight-way power-adjustable driver seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel with accent-color threading including audio controls, ebony carpet, ebony floor mats with accent threading, "50th" Anniversary emblems on the sill plates and a choice of two premium exterior colors: Black Granite Metallic and Red Jewel Tintcoat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nunez |first=Alex |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2007/12/14/2008-chevy-impala-50th-anniversary-edition-coming-to-detroit/ |title=2008 Chevy Impala 50th Anniversary Edition coming to Detroit |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Luxury Edition package was again available on the LT and now also featured leather-wrapped steering wheel, steering wheel mounted audio controls, traction control, and anti-lock brakes.

===2009===
[[File:09 Impala interior.JPG|thumb|right|Interior of a 2009 Impala]]

For the 2009 model year, the Impala received three new exterior colors: Victory Red, Silver Ice Metallic, and Aqua Blue Metallic, while the brushed aluminum dash applique was no longer available. All models used the previous SS style spoiler (actually phased in for the late 2008 model year). The Touring trim level was discontinued for 2009. Leather seating was no longer available in combination with the 40/20/40 split bench front seat. The Active Fuel Management feature remained on the 5.3&amp;nbsp;L V8 with a 17-gallon gas tank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/impala/2009/standard-equipment/ |title= 2009 Chevrolet Impala |website=cars.com |access-date= February 5, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140221152557/http://www.cars.com/chevrolet/impala/2009/standard-equipment/ |archive-date= February 21, 2014 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the SS model, but was no longer available on 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 for the LT and LTZ models. A sun and wheel package was available on 1LT models included power sunroof, overhead console with Homelink and 17-inch aluminum wheels. A Bose Premium Audio System was now part of the Luxury Edition package offered on LT models. Thorax side-impact air bags were standard.

===2010===
For the 2010 model year, the Impala was the only GM W-body car in production, although the eight-cylinder SS model was discontinued. LT models included fog lights and once again offered an optional Luxury Edition package. The 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 was no longer available for the LT model. Two new exterior colors were available: Summit White and Cyber Gray Metallic, and four exterior colors were deleted. The (PDG) convenience package, AM/FM stereo with 6-disc in-dash CD changer, and trunk [[cargo net]] were no longer available. The Impala emblems on rear sail panels as well as the rear decklid badge on LS models were deleted. Early 2010 models had the lower front-side GM badges but were also later deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/NASApp/domestic/proddesc.jsp?year=2010&amp;butID=1&amp;regionID=1&amp;divisionID=3&amp;vehicleID=8781&amp;type=0# |title=Model Information&amp;nbsp;– Online Ordering Guide |publisher=Eogld.ecomm.gm.com |accessdate=June 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090514061152/http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/NASApp/domestic/proddesc.jsp?year=2010&amp;butID=1&amp;regionID=1&amp;divisionID=3&amp;vehicleID=8781&amp;type=0 |archivedate=May 14, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.detnews.com/article/20090825/AUTO01/908250320/1148/rss25 |title=GM to drop corporate logo from vehicles |publisher=The Detroit News |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
For the 2011 model year, Impala returned in LS, LT, and LTZ trims. Available engines were a 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 (LS or LT) or a 3.9&amp;nbsp;L V6 (LTZ only). A Luxury Edition package was again an option on the LT and featured leather heated seats, 6-way power front passenger seat, Bose Premium Audio System, XM radio, auto-dimming rearview mirror, Universal Home Remote, outside heated power mirrors, and rear spoiler. The 2011 Impala had the same wheels as the 2012–2013 Impala, but the 2011 Impala was the last model year where the chrome trim on the trunk lid appeared.

===2012===
[[File:2012 Chevrolet Impala -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2012 facelift]]
[[File:Stinson Beach, California - USA (8730399821).jpg|thumb|right|2012 facelift]]

For the 2012 model year, the exterior received a slight refresh and 4 trims: a standard Impala, LS, LT, and LTZ. The 3.5 and 3.9&amp;nbsp;L engines were dropped in favor of a single, 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[GM High Feature engine#LFX|LFX]] that delivers {{convert|302|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|262|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. The four-speed automatic transmission is also deleted in favor of a six-speed automatic. The Impala also received new packages, including the LS Uplevel package, LS OnStar and Bluetooth package, LT Sunroof package, LT OnStar package and the LT OnStar and Bluetooth package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.leftlanenews.com/chevrolet-impala-2012.html |title=Refreshed 2012 Chevrolet Impala shows its new face |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110626011941/http://www.leftlanenews.com/chevrolet-impala-2012.html |archive-date=June 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===
For the 2013 model year, the Impala was largely a carryover of the 2012 model. Available trims were once again LS, LT, and LTZ. It was the last retail Impala to be offered with optional bench seat and column shift transmission. A Luxury Edition package, last seen on the 2011 model, returned as an option on the LT and featured perforated [[leather]] seating surfaces, dual front heated [[bucket seats]] with driver's side 8-way and passenger's side 6-way power adjusters, inside rearview auto-dimming mirror, Universal Home Remote, outside heated power adjustable mirrors, [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] 8-speaker premium sound system, six-disc in-dash [[CD changer]] that played [[MP3]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] files, with [[Radio Data System]], [[Sirius-XM]] [[satellite radio]], and well as [[iPod]] and [[USB]] inputs, as well as an auxiliary input. This was the last car to have a bench seat in the front. Due to the early release of the redesigned 2014 model, the 2013 Impala had an abbreviated model year.

===Impala Limited (2014–2016)===
The ninth generation model remained in production in LS, LT, and LTZ trim until the 2016 model year as a rental, fleet, and police car under the revised model name "Impala Limited". The consolidated plant in [[Oshawa|Oshawa, Canada]] continued making the Impala Limited, along with the Chevrolet Equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gmauthority.com/blog/2012/12/gm-confirms-current-generation-chevy-impala-production-through-2014/ |title=GM Confirms Current Generation Chevy Impala Production Through 2014 |work=GM Authority|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production ended in May 2016.

===Impala 9C1 &amp; 9C3 (ninth generation)===
[[File:Manhattan, New York - USA (6914876902).jpg|thumb|Impala Police Package]]

The Impala again was offered as a police vehicle in the ninth generation form. The 9C1 and 9C3 models were based on the LS model, yet offered steel wheels or steel wheels with wheel covers, optional rubber flooring, preparation for police equipment such as sirens, radios, and lighting, special badging, and inoperable rear door handles, windows, and door locks. It also came with the option for a rear vinyl bench seat and front cloth bucket or bench seats, both cloth front and rear seats, or vinyl front and rear seats. It also offered preparation for a criminal cage to be installed between the front and rear seats. The foglamps seen on the LT, LTZ, and SS were optional in 2008 &amp; stayed as an option until 2012 which did away with that option. The 9C1 and 9C3 also had the option of having the spoiler seen on the LT and LTZ until being replaced by the spoiler that is on the SS and other models in 2009. The police sedans received the FlexFuel in 2008 feature to compete against the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]], which also received a similar feature allowing it to utilize [[E85]]. The Impala 9C1 and 9C3 models used the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L (237 cu in) V6.&lt;ref name="LZG/9specs"&gt;[http://media.gm.com/us/powertrain/en/product_services/2008/Spec%20Sheet/HVV6/08_LZG.xls]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police Sedans utilized the SS radiator and cooling system as an upgrade from the standard 3.9&amp;nbsp;L engine (used in the Impala LTZ). GM did not wish to design a specific radiator and cooling system to equip a low-production V8 police vehicle. Also, the heavy-duty steel wheels were not redesigned, and as such, the Police Sedan used the original center caps or the older style wheel covers from the 8th generation model. The 9C1 and 9C3 were equipped with an external trunk lock tumbler starting in 2008. Neither feature was available for the civilian version of the car. The 9C1 and 9C3 police models had the standard wood grain for the 2006 model year until 2007 which was replaced by an aluminized interior trim. For the 2012 model year both the 9C1 and 9C3 have different end caps where the fog lamps are on the LT and LTZ trims on the front end bumper, received 17-inch wheels with new wheel covers, and the same [[GM High Feature engine#LFX|LFX V6]] that powers the civilian Impala. The [[Chevrolet Caprice#North America|Caprice PPV]] succeeded the Impala 9C1 after production ended in 2016. Up to then, the Caprice 9C1 and Impala 9C1 was offered simultaneously.

This tenth generation Impala is larger than the previous generation, sharing the extended [[GM Epsilon platform|Epsilon II]] FWD platform with the [[Cadillac XTS]]. The current generation is assembled in [[Oshawa]], Ontario, Canada, alongside the ninth-generation Impala (now renamed the fleet and rental exclusive-only Impala Limited), and at the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=aolreview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Dec/1216_impala |title=GM Invests $68 million for Next-Gen Impala in Oshawa |publisher=GM Media Online |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All trim levels are equipped with a six-speed [[automatic transmission]] with sport and manual shifting modes.

The 2014 Impala came standard with 18&amp;nbsp;inch wheels (19, and 20&amp;nbsp;inch offered in higher trims), low profile [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] Headlights and [[LED]] daytime running lights (On LTZ trim) and offered three engines; a 2.5 L [[Inline-four engine|4-Cylinder]] (the first time the Impala will use this type), a 2.4 L 4-Cylinder with hybrid-assist technology, and a 3.6 L V6.&lt;ref name="dapspecs"/&gt; The interior came equipped with a 4.2-inch color display featuring [[Chevrolet MyLink]] (LT and LTZ trims), [[HD Radio]] (all trims) and [[Pandora Radio]] (LT and LTZ trims), [[Active noise control|Active noise cancellation]] for all 4-cylinder options, while new safety features included 10 Standard Airbags combined with [[OnStar]]. Optional features for the 2014 model included "full-speed-range [[adaptive cruise control]], collision mitigation braking, forward collision alert, lane departure warning, side blind zone alert, rear cross traffic alert, rear camera and rear-park assist."&lt;ref name="motors1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Motors |first=General |url= http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Apr/0404_impala |title=All-New Impala |publisher=Media.Chevrolet.com |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model year changes===
For 2015, 4G LTE was added to OnStar as an optional feature&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/01/06/chevy-onstar-4g-lte-hotspot-apps-video/ "Chevy announces broad deployment of 4G LTE with OnStar (w/videos)"] from Autoblog (January 6, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; HD Radio was no longer offered starting with the 2015 model year. In addition, the eAssist version was discontinued due to low sales.

For the 2016 model year, the Impala went from five to four trim levels: LS, LT1, LT2, and LTZ2. A Midnight appearance package was added as an upgrade for the LT and LTZ level trims, which included unique black-pocket wheels and gloss black badges in addition to the standard black paint. Five new colors were introduced: Siren Red Tintcoat, Citron Green Metallic, Heather Gray Metallic, Mosaic Black Metallic, and Green Envy Metallic; six colors were dropped: Autumn Bronze, Red Rock, Crystal Red Tintcoat, Ashen Gray, Silver Topaz, and Champagne Silver. The Jet Black/Brownstone interior color scheme was dropped. 2016 models also came equipped with a new 800 cold-cranking amps battery, replacing the 900 CCA. Wireless charging for devices, front and rear splash guards, as well as lane change alert were added. The CD player was now only offered as standard equipment on the LTZ, but available as an option on other trims as part of the Technology package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/04/2016-chevy-impala-gets-a-bevy-of-changes-and-a-few-updates/ "2016 Chevy Impala Gets A Bevy Of Changes And A Few Updates"] from GM Authority (April 21, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 also saw the addition of [[CarPlay|Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] Capability features; only one phone brand at any one time can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927225/apple-carplays-coming-to-these-14-chevrolet-cars-in-the-2016-model-year.html "Apple CarPlay's coming to these 14 Chevrolet cars in the 2016 model year"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927293/these-are-the-14-chevrolet-cars-from-the-2016-model-year-that-will-have-android-auto.html "These are the 14 Chevrolet cars from the 2016 model year that will have Android Auto"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the "OnStar/Connections Plan" being rebranded as the "Guidance Plan", the 2016 Impala's option packages were rebranded:

*LS Convenience to Protection Package
*Advanced Safety to Driver Confidence Package
*Premium Seating to Leather Package
*Premium Audio and Sport Wheels to Technology Package
*Comfort and Convenience to Enhanced Convenience Package
*Premium Audio to Advanced Technology Package

The 2017 model year Impala only saw minor changes, with the top of the line LTZ trim rebrand as the Premier trim and Pepperdust Metallic introduced as a new color option. The LS trim, previously available only with the four-cylinder engine, became available with the V6 engine in addition to the four-cylinder engine.

The 2018 model year Impala went from four trims to three: LS, LT, and Premier. The LT level trim added Entertainment, Convenience, and Leather packages options, while the Premier trim received the top of the line Convenience package. Keyless starts, rear camera view, and MyLink became standard on all three levels trims, as the LS trim deletes the 4.2 inch display and AM/FM radio features. Daytime running lights became standard on LT and navigation became standard on Premier. During the Third Quarter of 2018 three new colors, Nightfall Gray Metallic, Cajun Red Tintcoat, and Graphite Metallic, will be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/04/2018-chevrolet-impala-gets-standard-features-galore-new-colors-and-more/ “2018 Chevrolet Impala Gets Standard Features Galore, New Colors And More”] from GM Authority (April 13, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 model year Impala will see only minor changes. The jet black interior is added to the LT convenience package, while the accessory level wheel locks becomes standard on all trims. The Graphite Metallic color is discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/04/2019-chevy-impala-gets-these-three-changes/ “2019 Chevy Impala Gets These Three Changes”] from GM Authority (April 25, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2020 model year Impala (its final year for the sedan) will only feature LT and Premier level trims. Both trims will only be available with a 3.6L engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/07/2020-chevrolet-impala-drops-ls-model-2-5l-four-cylinder-engine/ “2020 Chevrolet Impala Drops LS Model, 2.5L Four Cylinder Engine”] from GM Authority (July 15, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Bi-Fuel===
The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Bi-Fuel runs on CNG (compressed natural gas) and gasoline. Unveiled in October 2013 by General Motors CEO [[Dan Akerson]], the Bi-Fuel Impala would be offered to both fleet customers and retail. It is the only full-size CNG vehicle manufactured in North America. The new Impala will join the [[Honda Civic]] as a rare factory made CNG car to come straight from a major automaker and available for retail sales.

The 2015 Chevrolet Impala Bi-Fuel has a 500-mile driving range. It will allow the driver to switch from gasoline to CNG or from CNG to gasoline at the push of a button. The CNG tank is placed in the trunk. The Impala Bi-Fuel was one of the five finalists for the 2015 [[Green Car of the Year]] Award during the 2014 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://green.autoblog.com/2014/10/21/2015-green-car-of-the-year-finalists-announced/|title= 2015 Green Car Of The Year finalists announced, run alt-fuel gamut|first=Sebastian|last=Blanco|publisher=Autoblog Green |date=2014-10-21|accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost to the [[BMW i3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-la-auto-show-green-car-year-20141119-story.html |title=LA Auto Show 2014: BMW's i3 named Green Car of the Year |last=Fleming |first=Charles |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2014-11-20 |accessdate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International markets===
The Impala went on sale in [[South Korea]] as an export vehicle for the 2016 model year, marking the first time that Chevrolet had offered an American-built full-size sedan in the Korean market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/07/2016-chevrolet-impala-to-be-exported-out-to-south-korea/ "2016 Chevrolet Impala Exported To South Korea"] from GM Authority (July 31, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trim levels===
The tenth-generation Chevrolet Impala is available in three trim levels: '''LS''', '''LT''', and '''LTZ''' (later '''Premier'''). Each trim level includes a generous amount of standard equipment:

'''LS''' Includes: 2.5L [[EcoTec]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, six-speed automatic transmission, Eighteen-inch (18") black-painted steel wheels with full plastic wheel covers, 4.2-inch (4.2") color LCD radio with Bluetooth (2014-2017 models), eight-inch (8.0") [[Chevrolet MyLink]] infotainment system (2018-2019 models), 100-watt six-speaker audio system, keyless entry, premium cloth seating surfaces (2014-2017 models), premium cloth seating surfaces with leatherette trim (2018-2019 models), power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, [[OnStar]] with [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[Wi Fi]] capabilities (2015-2019 models), leather-wrapped steering wheel, split-folding rear bench seat, color-keyed exterior door handles, and black side mirrors. The LS trim was discontinued after the 2019 model year.

'''LT''' Adds to '''LS''': Eighteen-inch (18") aluminum-alloy wheels, eight-inch (8.0") [[Chevrolet MyLink]] infotainment system, security system, remote vehicle start, premium cloth seating surfaces with leatherette trim, dual power-adjustable front bucket seats, color-keyed side mirrors, and wood interior trim.

'''LTZ''' ('''Premier''') Adds To '''LT''': 3.6L VVT V6 gasoline engine with FlexFuel capabilities, nineteen-inch (19") aluminum-alloy wheels, keyless access with push-button start, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front and rear seats, heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, exterior [[LED]] Daytime Running Lamps (DRL's), rearview backup camera system, chrome-accented color-keyed exterior door handles with touch sensors, and chrome side mirrors.

==Discontinuation==
There was speculation that GM would discontinue the Impala in 2018 due to declining sales of American full-size sedans, in order to make room for more production of [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUVs]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/chevrolet-impala-sonic-report/&lt;/ref&gt; However, GM CEO [[Mary Barra]] later said that unlike [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|FCA]], GM had no plans to exit the sedan market,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/general-motors-car-lineup-future-discussed-in-earnings-call/&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time stated that the Impala would continue in production as a way to fill the void left by the planned departure of the [[Ford Taurus]] in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/08/chevrolet-has-no-plans-to-ditch-sedans/ "Chevrolet Has No Plans To Ditch Sedans"] from GM Authority (August 29, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; 

GM later reversed course and made plans to idle the Detroit-Hamtramck and Oshawa assembly facilities and retire the Impala nameplate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/chevrolet-impala-production-to-end-on-february-28-2020/ "Chevrolet Impala To End Production On February 28, 2020"] from GM Authority (December 5, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; After originally intending to end production in June 2019, GM decided to keep the Impala in production, with the extension of the assembly plants' idling to 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-detroit-cadillac-ct6-chevy-impala-until-2020/|date=22 February 2019|accessdate=24 February 2019|work=Roadshow by CNET|title=GM grants stay of execution for Cadillac CT6, Chevy Impala until 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/12/loss-of-chevrolet-impala-nameplate-a-blow-to-enthusiasts-americana/ "Loss Of Chevrolet Impala Nameplate A Blow To Enthusiasts, Americana"] from GM Authority (December 4, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; The final Chevrolet Impala was built at the Detroit/Hamtramck assembly plant on February 27, 2020.&lt;ref name=freep2020&gt;{{cite news |title=GM's last Chevrolet Impala just rolled off the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly line |first=Jamie L. |last=LaReau |work=The Detroit Free Press |date=February 27, 2020 |url=https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/02/27/chevy-impala-gm-detroit-hamtramck/4871778002/ |accessdate=February 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
In the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]]'s crash tests, the 2000 to 2005 Impala was given a "Good" rating overall for good structural performance and no chance of any significant injury in a crash of its severity, except for maybe a minor lower-left-leg injury, such as a bruise or sprain. The 2006 to present Impala is given a lesser overall "Acceptable" score for front impact collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=640 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chevrolet Impala |publisher=Iihs.org |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Good" score for side impacts. Side-curtain airbags are standard for front and rear rows; [[side torso airbag]]s previously unavailable became standard on all trim levels beginning with the 2009 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chevrolet.com|title=Chevrolet Cars, Trucks, SUVs, Crossovers and Vans|work=www.chevrolet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM made some minor structural enhancements to the Impala, beginning in December 2009; models produced after that received a "Good" in the IIHS frontal offset crash test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=1372 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Chevrolet Impala |publisher=Iihs.org |date=September 1, 2010 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, a local news station's investigative team in [[Rhode Island]] discovered that GM's fleet customers who purchased the 2006–2009 Impala were able to order them with the side-curtain airbags deleted for a savings of $175 per vehicle. Because these fleets typically sell off their cars after two to three years of use, many of the Impalas that were built without side-curtain airbags became privately owned cars. {{Citation needed span|Current owners may be able to tell if their car has side airbags by checking the [[VIN]] and/or by checking to see if "Air bag" is printed on the roof support between the front and back rows.|date=March 2018}}

Another potential safety hazard, affecting Impalas of model years 2007 and 2008, is premature rear tire wear caused by defective rear suspension components. Police vehicles were upgraded to correct this defect and law enforcement agencies were compensated for expenses incurred for tire replacement, but civilian vehicles were not recalled. As a result, Impala owners launched a [[class action]] lawsuit in July 2011 against General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detnews.com/article/20110705/AUTO01/107050361/1148/auto01/Impala-owners-sue-GM-over-alleged-defect-causing-tires-to-wear-out]{{Dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the current General Motors leadership claimed about a month later that they are not responsible to repair the defective vehicles manufactured pre-[[General Motors Bailout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/19/gm-impala-lawsuit-idUSN1E77I0Z820110819 | work=Reuters | title=GM says bankruptcy excuses it from Impala repairs | date=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in late September, a new lawsuit, disputing the GM response, was initiated by three of the estimated 400,000 Impala owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timmins |first=Be|title=New GM: 2007-2008 Impala Suspension Problems Were Old GM’s Problems, Not Ours |journal=Automobile Magazine |date=19 August 2011|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/news/new-gm-2007-2008-impala-suspension-problems-were-old-gms-problems-not-ours-69603/ |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (GM is also facing a similar legal dispute regarding a pre-bankruptcy upgrade to its [[OnStar]] system which left thousands of users without service in violation of their paid-up contracts.)

On April 22, 2014, the NHTSA opened an investigation into 60,000 2014 Chevrolet Impala models over concerns relating to the sedan's emergency braking system. This followed the NHTSA receiving a complaint from a driver who experienced "inappropriate activation of the emergency braking system," adding it "alleges that the driver assist system inappropriately activated emergency braking bringing the vehicle to a complete stop under what the driver considered to be full braking force." The driver also went on to say that he heard three to four beeps from the system while driving the rented vehicle, which had only 2500 miles on it. GM is fully co-operating in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ewing |first=Steven J. |title=2014 Chevy Impala being investigated over braking issue |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/22/2014-chevy-impala-investigation-braking-issue-report/ |website=Autoblog |date=22 April 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine awarded the full-size Chevrolet including the Impala as its 1977 [[Car of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;Motor Trend: Car of the Year-February 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

''Automotive Fleet'' and ''Business Fleet'' magazines awarded the Impala the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Fleet Car of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://car-reviews.automobile.com/news/new-chevy-impala-and-ford-f-150-win-fleet-segment-awards/1585/ |title=Automobile.com Fleet Segment Awards |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627230752/http://car-reviews.automobile.com/news/new-chevy-impala-and-ford-f-150-win-fleet-segment-awards/1585/ |archivedate=June 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotive-fleet.com/Article/Story/2007/12/Chevrolet-Sweeps-2008-Fleet-Car-Truck-of-the-Year.aspx|title=Chevrolet Sweeps 2008 Fleet Car &amp; Truck of the Year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canadian Automobile Association|Canadian Automobile Association (CAA)]] selected the Impala for its 2006 Pyramid Award for Environmental Initiatives for the launch of its new ethanol-powered E-85 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartest.ca/caa_presents_2006_pyramid_aw.htm|title=CAA Pyramid Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASCAR==
[[File:Chevrolet Impala SS NASCAR.JPG|thumb|right|[[NASCAR]] Chevrolet Impala from [[Universal Orlando Resort]] painted to resemble the #88 car driven by [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] in the Sprint Cup Series.]]

In 2007, the Impala began to replace the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]] on the [[NASCAR]] [[stock car racing]] circuit; more specifically, on all the scheduled racing events where NASCAR has mandated the use of a car with different (and some new) specifications, better known as the [[Car of Tomorrow]].

The Impala was also used to represent Chevrolet in the [[Nationwide Series]]. In 2013, the Impala was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] in the Nationwide Series.

The 2012 NASCAR season marked the end of use of the Impala nameplate on stock cars. From 2013 to 2017, Chevrolet drivers began driving the [[Holden Commodore (VF)|Holden VF Commodore SSV]] based [[Holden Commodore (VF)#Chevrolet SS|Chevrolet SS]] in Sprint Cup until the Chevrolet SS was discontinued after 2017.

The '''Chevrolet Malibu''' is a [[mid-size car]] manufactured and marketed by [[Chevrolet]] from 1964 to 1983 and since 1997. The Malibu began as a trim-level of the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], becoming its own model line in 1978. Originally a [[Rear wheel drive#Rear wheel drive layouts|rear-wheel-drive]] intermediate, [[General Motors|GM]] revived the Malibu nameplate as a [[front-wheel-drive]] car in 1997.

Named after coastal community of [[Malibu, California]], the Malibu was marketed primarily in North America, with the eighth generation introduced globally.
With the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Impala in March 2020, the Malibu and the Sonic currently are the only sedans offered in the Chevrolet division in the U.S.A.

{{Main|Chevrolet Chevelle#First generation (1964-1967)}}

The first Malibu was a top-line subseries of the mid-sized [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] from 1964 to 1972. Malibus were generally available in a full range of bodystyles including a four-door sedan, two-door Sport Coupe hardtop, convertible and two-seat station wagon. Interiors were more lavish than lesser Chevelle 300 and 300 Deluxe models thanks to patterned cloth and vinyl upholstery (all-vinyl in convertibles and station wagons), deep-twist carpeting, deluxe steering wheel and other items. The Malibu [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]] was available only as a two-door Sport Coupe hardtop or convertible and added bucket seats, center console (with optional four-speed manual or Powerglide transmissions), engine gauges and special wheelcovers, and offered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine offered in other Chevelles - with the top option being a {{convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} in 1964.

For 1965, Malibus and other Chevelles received new grilles and revised tail sections and had the exhaust pipes replaced but carried over the same basic styling and bodystyles from 1964. The Malibu and Malibu SS models continued as before with the SS featuring a blacked-out grille and special wheelcovers. Top engine option was now a {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8.
[[File:1967 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 Sports Coupe (15452516841).jpg|thumb|A red 1967 Chevrolet Malibu]]
The Malibu SS was replaced in 1966 by a new Chevelle SS-396 series that included a big-block {{convert|396|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine (Canadian market did not receive the SS396 but marketed the former Malibu SS nameplate until January 1967 when it was phased out), heavy duty suspension and other performance equipment. Other SS-396 equipment was similar to Malibu Sport Coupes and convertibles including an all-vinyl bench seat. Bucket seats and console with floor shift were now optional on the SS and for 1966 with the SS now denoting a car with a big-block engine, the bucket seats became a new option on the regular Malibu Sport Coupe and convertible, upon which any six-cylinder or small-block V8 could be ordered. Also new for 1966 was the Chevelle Malibu four-door Sport Sedan hardtop. Styling revisions on all 1966 Chevelles including more rounded styling similar to the full-sized Chevrolets with sail panels and tunneled rear windows featured on two-door hardtop coupes.

For 1967, the same assortment of bodystyles were continued with styling changes similar to all other Chevelles including a new grille and revised tail section with taillights that wrapped around to the side. New this year was a Chevelle Malibu Concours station wagon with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panel trim. Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo [[8-track tape]] player. The same assortment of drivetrains carried over from 1966 with the top {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 dropped from {{convert|350|to|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

Malibus and all other Chevelles were completely restyled for 1968 with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtops and wheelbases split to {{convert|112|in|mm}}} on two-door models and 116 for four-door sedans and station wagons. Engine offerings included a new {{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} that replaced the {{convert|283|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 that had served as the base V8 since the Chevelle's introduction in 1964. Inside was a new instrument panel featuring round gauges in square pods similar to what would appear in Camaros the following year. New for 1968 was the Concours luxury option for Malibu sedans and coupes that included upgraded cloth or vinyl bench seats, carpeted lower door panels, woodgrain trim on dash and door panels, a center console and floor shifter (only with the hardtop and convertible, which was shared with the SS396) and Concours nameplates. There was again a top-line Concours Estate wagon with simulated woodgrain trim that had the same interior and exterior appointments as the Malibu sedans.
[[File:Chevrolet Malibu 2-door mid 1970s model.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Chevelle Malibu 2-door sport coupe]]
New grilles and rear decks with revised taillights highlighted the 1969 Malibus and other Chevelles. Instrument panels were revised and front seat headrests were now standard equipment due to federal safety mandate. The ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column and also doubled as a steering wheel lock. The 307 continued as the base V8, but the 327 engines were replaced by new {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s of {{convert|255|and|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. GM's three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, previously only offered on SS-396 Chevelles (RPO M40), was now available on all models with all engines (THM400s were used with the 396 while the THM350 (RPO M38) first introduced with the Camaro and Nova) was phased in with the small blocks optioned, including the six-cylinder and small-block V8s which in previous years were only available with the two-speed Powerglide. A police package Chevelle 300 (pillared 4 door sedan) was available for the 1969 model year which came with the L35 code 396 - it was built in few numbers when the Chrysler Corporation held the market for its law enforcement orders. Some 1964 and 1965 Chevelle 300s came with the BO7 police package but was powered with the inline six.

For 1970, the Malibu was initially the only series of Chevelle offered, aside from the SS-396 and new SS-454, as the low-line 300 and 300 Deluxe models were discontinued for the American market (it continued in Canada until 1972), which also eliminated the two-door pillared coupes from the Chevelle lineup – which were never included in the Malibu series. New grilles, rear decks with taillights moved into the bumper and revised Sport Coupe roofline highlighted this year's changes. The standard six-cylinder engine was punched up from {{convert|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, while the same assortment of V8s carried over with the addition of a {{convert|330|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 on non-SS Chevelles. At mid-year, the Malibu was rejoined by lower-line Chevelle models that were simply called the base Chevelle in both four-door sedans and two-door hardtops.

In 1971, Malibus and all other Chevelles got a new grille surrounded by single headlamps replacing the duals of previous years, and four round taillights similar to Camaros and Corvettes were located in the bumper. All engines were detuned to use lower-octane unleaded gasoline this year per GM corporate policy as a first step toward the catalytic converter-equipped cars planned for 1975 and later models which would require no-lead fuel.

Only new grilles highlighted the 1972 Malibu and other Chevelles. All bodystyles were carried over from 1971, but 1972 would be the final year for hardtops and convertibles as the redesigned Chevelles originally planned for this year, but delayed until 1973, would feature Colonnade styling with side pillars and frameless door windows. The 1972 Chevelle was also ordered with the police package which used RPO 9C1 (which became the default SEO (service option) code for subsequent [[9C1 (Chevrolet Police package)|Chevrolet PPV package]]s).

[[File:1977 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Classic Landau Coupé, front left.jpg|thumb|1977 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Classic Landau Coupe]]

The Chevelle was redesigned for the 1973 model year. Models included the base '''Deluxe''', mid-range '''Malibu''' &amp; '''Malibu SS''' and the top-line '''Laguna'''.

For 1974, the Deluxe was dropped, and the Malibu became the entry-level Chevelle. The Laguna trim package was replaced with the Malibu Classic which used a stacked arrangement of four rectangular headlights and made its way to the dealers in the 1976 model year, offering the Chevrolet built inline six 250 CID as the base engine. The Laguna S-3 model was introduced to replace the [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]], and continued through 1976.

For the 1978 model year, the Malibu name, which had been the bestselling badge in the lineup, replaced the [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] name. This was Chevrolet's second [[downsize (automobile)|downsized]] nameplate, following the lead of the 1977 [[Chevrolet Caprice]]. The new, more efficient platform was over a foot shorter and had shed {{convert|500|to|1000|lb|}} compared to previous versions, yet offered increased trunk space, leg room, and head room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-malibu15.htm|title=How Stuff Works 1978 Chevrolet Malibu|publisher=How Stuff Works}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two trim levels were offered - Malibu and Malibu Classic. The Malibu Classic Landau series had a two-tone paint job on the upper and lower body sections, and a vinyl top. This generation introduced the [[General Motors 90° V6 engine|Chevrolet 90° V6]] family of engines, with the 200 CID (3.3&amp;nbsp;L) V6 as the base engine for the all new 1978 Chevrolet Malibu, along with the 229 CID (3.8&amp;nbsp;L) V6 and the 305 CID (5.0&amp;nbsp;L) Chevy built V8 as options.  The 200 and 229 engines were essentially a small block V-8, with one pair of cylinders lopped off.  The front and rear bellhousing face were the same as the small V8.  The 231 engine was a Buick product, and featured a front distributor.

Three bodystyles were produced ([[station wagon]], [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], and [[coupe]]), and the design was also used as the basis for the [[Chevrolet El Camino#Fifth generation|El Camino]] pickup truck with its own chassis. The sedan initially had a conservative six-window [[notchback]] roofline. This was in contrast to the unusual fastback rooflines adopted by Oldsmobile and Buick divisions which would later revert a more formal pillar style. To increase rear seat hip room (and encourage more orders for the high-profit air conditioner), the windows in the rear doors of four-door sedans were fixed, while the wagons had small moveable vents. With the rear window regulators no longer required, Chevrolet was able to recess the door arm rests into the door cavity, resulting in a few extra inches of rear seat room. Customers complained about the lack of rear seat ventilation. No doubt this design contributed to the number of factory air conditioning units sold with the cars, to the benefit of General Motors and Chevrolet dealers. For the 1981 model year, sedans adopted a four-window profile and "formal" pillared upright roofline. The two-door coupe was last produced in this year, as the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fourth generation|Monte Carlo]] assumed the market position held by the 2-door coupe. For 1982 the Malibu was facelifted with more squared-off front styling marked by quad headlights with long, thin turn signals beneath them. The look was very reminiscent of the also recently facelifted Chevrolet Caprice. For 1983, Malibus gained a block-style "Malibu" badge on the front fenders to replace the cursive-style script located on the rear quarter panels of previous model years.

The four-door Malibu was commonly used in fleet service, especially for law enforcement. After the [[Chevrolet Nova]] ceased production in 1979, the [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] '''9C1''' [[police car|police version]] (not to be confused with the full-size [[Chevrolet Impala]] '''9C1''' which was also available) was transferred to the Malibu, filling a void for the [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] [[police car|police patrol car]]s. A 9C1-equipped Malibu with an LT-1 Z-28 Camaro engine driven by [[E. Pierce Marshall]] placed 13th of 47 in the 1979 [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]], better known as the Cannonball Run.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brock Yates|Yates, Brock]] (2002) "Cannonball!: World's Greatest Outlaw Road Race" MBI Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-7603-1090-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no factory Malibu SS option available on this generation. The SS only came in the [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].
The rare, and striking, 1980 Malibu M80 was a dealer package for only North and South Carolina. It was mostly aimed at NASCAR fans who regularly traveled to Darlington Raceway. To this day, the number actually produced is unknown; estimates place this around 1,901 cars. All M80s had to be white with dark blue bucket seats and center console interior. The base of the M80 was a two-door sport coupe equipped with the F41 Sport Suspension package and the normal V8 (140&amp;nbsp;hp) drive train. The M80 option added two dark blue skunk stripes on top and a lower door stripe with the M80 identification. The package also added front and rear spoilers and 1981 steel rally wheels (sourced from the 1980 Monte Carlo).

In Mexico, General Motors produced this generation in the [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly|Ramos Arizpe plant]], which was sold during three years (1979 to 1981). Mexican versions came in three trim levels (Chevelle, Malibu and Malibu Classic) and two body styles (sedan and coupe) with the {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 as basic engine and the {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the optional; this engine was standard on Malibu Classic models during those three years. This was possible because the Mexican emissions regulations remained relatively free at the time.

===Iraqi taxi===
In 1981, [[General Motors Canada|General Motors of Canada]] in [[Oshawa]] produced a special order of 25,500 four-door Malibu sedans for [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]i government. The deal was reportedly worth well over $100 million to GMCL. These special-order Malibus carried the unusual combination of GM's lowest-power carburated V6, the {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|229|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine mated to three-speed manual transmission with a unique on-the-floor stick shifter. All of the cars were equipped with air conditioning, heavy duty cooling systems, AM/FM cassette decks, front bench seats, 200&amp;nbsp;km/h speedometers, tough tweed and vinyl upholstery and {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} body-color stamped steel wheels with small "dog dish" hubcaps.

However, only 13,000 units ever made it to Iraq, with the majority of the cars becoming taxis in [[Baghdad]] (once the cab-identifying orange paint was added to the front and rear fenders){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. With the remaining balance of about 12,500 additional Malibus either sitting on a dock in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] or awaiting port shipment in [[Oshawa]], where they were built, the Iraqis suddenly cancelled the order in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E3D71439F933A05750C0A964948260 |title=G.M. Canada Files Insurance Claim |work=New York Times |date=March 30, 1982 |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excuses reportedly included various "quality concerns", including the inability of the local drivers to shift the finicky Saginaw [[manual transmission]]. This issue was eventually identified as being due to an apparent clutch release issue that eventually required on-site retrofitting by a crew of Canadian technicians sent to Iraq to support the infamous "Recall in the Desert". Later speculation was that the Iraqis were actually forced to back out for financial reasons, due to their escalating hostilities with [[Iran]] requiring the immediate diversion of funds to support the Iraqi war effort. Then GM of Canada President Donald Hackworth was initially quoted as stating GMCL intended to still try to sell the Malibus overseas in other Middle East markets; however in the end, the orphaned "Iraqi Taxi" Malibus were all sold to the Canadian public at the greatly reduced price of about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]6,800. Over the years, they have acquired a low-key 'celebrity' status, sometimes being colloquially referred to as "Iraqibu".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curbsideclassic.com/blog/automotive-history-snapshot-1981-chevrolet-malibu-iraqi-taxi/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://jalopnik.com/this-chevy-malibu-tells-a-far-out-story-from-a-far-away-856827455&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASCAR===
The Malibu was an extensively used body style in [[NASCAR]] competition from 1973 to 1983. The Laguna S-3 variant, in particular, was successful during the 1975 through 1977 racing seasons, with [[Cale Yarborough]] winning 20 races in those years as well as winning the NASCAR championship one year. Because it was considered a limited edition model, NASCAR declared it ineligible for competition following the 1977 season, even though (given NASCARs three-year eligibility rule) it should have been allowed to run through 1979. Beginning in 1981, the downsized Malibu body style was eligible to run, but given its boxy shape, only one driver [[Dave Marcis]] ran it in 1981 and 1982, with one victory in a rain-shortened [[Capital City 400|Richmond 400]] at [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]] in 1982, the independent driver's last win.

===G platform===
Beginning in 1982, the Malibu shared GM's redesignated [[rear-wheel drive|rear-wheel-drive]] [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]] with cars like the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Buick Regal]]. The Malibu Classic was last marketed in 1982; Malibus were produced as four-door sedans and as station wagons until 1983, at which time it was fully replaced by the [[front-wheel drive|front-wheel-drive]] [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]. Although the sedan and wagon were phased out, the [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]] [[Coupé utility|utility]], which shared styling with the Malibu, remained in production until 1987.

A new [[front-wheel drive]] Malibu was introduced for the 1997 model year on an extended wheelbase version of the [[GM N platform]] shared with the [[Buick Skylark]], [[Oldsmobile Achieva]], [[Oldsmobile Alero]], and [[Pontiac Grand Am]] as a competitor to the perennial stalwarts the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry which were the best sellers in the midsize market. GM phased out the L platform Corsica/Beretta where a new midsize was introduced in the wake of GM phasing out its B platform (at this time the Chevrolet Lumina was the largest car). All N-body Malibus were produced at the [[Oklahoma City Assembly]] plant (after 2002 it was retooled to build the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 360|GMT360]] [[SUV]]s) and the [[Wilmington Assembly]] plant (1997 to 1999), before moving production to [[Lansing, Michigan]]. The Wilmington plant was retooled to build the [[Saturn L-Series]] in 1999. The [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] was a rebadged, slightly more upscale version of the Malibu, produced from October 1996 – 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://newsok.com/article/2740529/conversion-nears-gm-workers-face-temporary-layoffs-before-production-change&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended as a placeholder model to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the aging [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]], before the all-new [[Oldsmobile Alero|Alero]] arrived in 1999. The Malibu itself replaced the [[compact car|compact]] [[Chevrolet Corsica]]. Power came from a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L 150&amp;nbsp;hp (112&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Inline-four engine|I4]] or 3.1&amp;nbsp;L 155&amp;nbsp;hp (116&amp;nbsp;kW) V6. The Malibu was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 1997; this was later criticized by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' in 2009, citing that the Malibu was insufficiently distinguishable in terms of performance or interior quality to warrant such praise in hindsight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.yahoo.com/articles/autos_content_landing_pages/846/dishonorable-mention-the-10-most-embarrassing-award-winners-in-automotive-history/ |title=Dishonorable Mention: The 10 Most Embarrassing Award Winners in Automotive History- Yahoo!

[[File:2004 Chevrolet Malibu Classic 2.2L, rear 8.23.19.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Chevrolet Malibu Classic]]

The 1997 to 1999 Malibus had a front grille with the Malibu logo in silver in the center; 2000 to 2003 models, and the Classic, had the blue Chevrolet emblem on the front grille. The 1997 to 2003 LS models were sometimes equipped with special gold-colored badges (the rear Malibu lettering and logo).

When a new Malibu was introduced on the Epsilon platform for 2004, the N-body Malibu was renamed '''Chevrolet Classic''' and remained in production for the 2004 and 2005 model years, being restricted to rental car companies and fleet orders with production ending in April 2005. 

The 3.1 L V6 was updated in 2000 with a new power rating of 170&amp;nbsp;hp (127&amp;nbsp;kW), and the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder was dropped after that year. However, a 4-cylinder was reintroduced in 2004 when the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[Ecotec]] was offered on the Classic. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] fuel mileage estimates for the 2.2&amp;nbsp;L Ecotec engine are {{convert|21|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}-{{convert|31|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.

===Malibu Cruiser===
The February 2002 issue of ''HCI: Hot Compact &amp; Imports'' magazine featured the Chevrolet Malibu Cruiser concept that [[GM Performance Division]] built for the [[SEMA#2001|SEMA]] show in 2001. The car was painted in "Sublime Lime" by [[BASF]]&lt;ref name="Sublime"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chevrolet Malibu Cruiser Concept |url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/357.html |date= |publisher=supercars.net |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured a highly modified [[turbocharged]] 3500 [[MPFI|SFI]] 60-degree V6 (producing {{convert|230|hp|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} at 5,000 rpm and {{convert|280|lb·ft|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} of torque at 2,900 rpm), a 4T65-E [[manual transmission|four-speed transmission]] with [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]], a set of 19x8-inch wheels by Evo wrapped in [[Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Company|Toyo]] Proxes T1-S high-performance tires. Numerous interior modifications included a full-length custom center console, four black leather [[Sparco]] racing seats, and a [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] entertainment center (with radio, [[compact disc|CD]], [[DVD]], [[television|TV]], 10-disc [[Compact disc player#CD changer|changer]] and numerous [[Automobile audio#Amplifiers|amps]] and speakers). Exterior modifications included custom [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] headlamps (both low and high beams), "Altezza" style taillights, and a custom bodykit.&lt;ref name="SEMA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chevrolet Malibu Cruiser &amp;mdash; 2001 SEMA Auto Show |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/autoshows/sema/2001/chevroletmalibucruiser.html |date= |publisher=edmunds.com |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrolet produced the Cruiser as a [[concept car|concept]], and it was therefore never available for purchase. Their intent was to attract younger buyers to the stock model and demonstrate that [[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] modifications could be made.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[File:2004-2005 Chevrolet Malibu MAXX LS.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Malibu MAXX LS]]
The Malibu name was moved to GM's new [[GM Epsilon platform|Epsilon platform]] based on the 2002 [[Opel Vectra]] C for 2004. The Epsilon-based Malibu came in two bodystyles, a standard 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and a 5-door '''Malibu Maxx''' hatchback (the first mid-size Chevrolet hatchback since the 1989 [[Chevrolet Corsica]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/malibumaxx/review.html |title=Chevrolet Malibu Maxx Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cars.about.com/od/2001/fr/05MalibuMaxx_ts.htm |title=2005 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx - Test drive and new car review - 2005 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx |publisher=Cars.about.com |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409004749/http://cars.about.com/od/2001/fr/05MalibuMaxx_ts.htm |archivedate=April 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malibu Maxx has a fixed glass roof panel over the rear seats with a retractable sunshade, and an optional glass panel sunroof over the front seats and was similar in execution to the [[Opel Signum]], a large hatchback derived from the Vectra C.

Base power for the sedan came from a 2.2&amp;nbsp;L [[GM Ecotec engine#L61|Ecotec L61]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] producing 144&amp;nbsp;hp (108&amp;nbsp;kW). ''LS'' and ''LT'' trim sedans and Maxx models originally came with a 3.5&amp;nbsp;L 201&amp;nbsp;hp (149&amp;nbsp;kW) [[GM High Value engine#LX9|High Value LX9]] [[V6 engine|V6]]. The SS sedan and Maxx models were powered by the 3.9&amp;nbsp;L {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Value engine#LZ9|High Value LZ9]] V6.&lt;ref name="2006specs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://junkcarwizard.com/resources/2006-chevrolet-malibu-specifications/|title=2006 Chevrolet Malibu Specs}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2007, the LX9 was replaced with the [[GM High Value engine#LZ4|LZ4]] V6, which in the Malibu produced 217&amp;nbsp;hp (162&amp;nbsp;kW). The L61 Ecotec was also updated for the 2007 model year with many improvements. A remote starter was also available, which was introduced on several other GM vehicles for 2004.

}}

This generation of the Malibu initially debuted with a front fascia design featuring a wide [[grille]] split horizontally by a prominent chrome bar that ran the entire width of the car, which was intended to make it resemble Chevrolet's [[truck]]s. However, for 2006, the front end was updated with more conventional styling: the chrome bar was removed, and the grille itself was made smaller, bearing a resemblance to the grille on the previous Malibu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/chevrolet/malibu/2006/|title=2006 Chevrolet Malibu Review|publisher=JB car pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car also added GM badges near the front doors.

While the Malibu Maxx was discontinued after the 2007 model year, the Malibu sedan remained in production for the 2008 [[model year]], known as the '''Malibu Classic'''. The cars themselves bear Malibu badges, unlike the past generation Classic.

Extensive engineering and design went into the remodel.&lt;ref name="article1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Helliker |first=Kevin |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123854495134475899?mod=article-outset-box |title=Malibu Shows Road to Revival Is Bumpy |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trim levels were Base (2008 only), LS, LT, Hybrid (2008 and 2009 only), and the range-topping LTZ. The top-line LTZ cars had clear [[Automotive lighting|brake light]] lenses with red LEDs, the balance of trim packages retaining red lenses with conventional brake light bulbs.

The seventh generation Malibu is built on a revised version of the long-[[wheelbase]] [[GM Epsilon platform|Epsilon]] platform shared with the [[Saturn Aura]], the [[Opel Signum]], and [[Pontiac G6]]. It is assembled in [[Kansas City, Kansas]]. Overall, it is three inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm) longer, with a six inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) longer wheelbase. Interior room remains mid-size, like the previous Malibus, and has been decreased from {{convert|101|cuft|m3|1}} to {{convert|97.7|cuft|m3|1}}, despite having a longer wheelbase, although front legroom has increased from {{convert|41.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|42.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="2006specs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://junkcarwizard.com/resources/2008-chevrolet-malibu-specifications/|title=2008 Chevrolet Malibu Specs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear legroom has decreased from {{convert|38.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|37.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cargurus.com/Cars/Specs-c8190-2008-Malibu.html |title=2008 Chevrolet Malibu Specs|publisher=CarGurus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior design was revised, with a selection of two-tone color combinations (brick and tan two-tone), telescoping steering wheel, higher-quality materials and a twin-cowl dash design.&lt;ref name="jb2008"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/chevrolet/malibu/2008/ |title=2008 Chevrolet Malibu Review|publisher=JB car pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drag (Cd) is at 0.33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/content/download/82857/1050463/version/1/file/chemal_ltz_08_ss.pdf |title=Chevrolet Malibu LTZ Specs |publisher=Car and Driver }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2.4&amp;nbsp;L I4 and 3.6&amp;nbsp;L V6 engine have [[aluminum]] blocks and heads, [[dual overhead cams]], four valves per cylinder, twin [[balance shafts]], and [[variable valve timing]]. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 has aluminum heads, an iron block, overhead valves, and limited variable valve timing. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was offered as an upgrade for special-order fleet vehicles, to replace the Ecotec engine, and generally was not available for retail customers. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 was not available in the LTZ. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 with four-speed transmission has been the only drivetrain available in the 2008, 2009, and 2010 models in Israel. Partway through the 2008 model year, the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L Ecotec was offered with a six-speed [[automatic transmission]] to improve performance and fuel economy.&lt;ref name="jb2008" /&gt;

For 2009 models, the six-speed transmission mated to the 2.4&amp;nbsp;L 4-cylinder engine or the 217 horsepower 3.5&amp;nbsp;L V6 mated to the four-speed automatic were made available on the 1LT; the six-speed became standard on 2LT models the same year. The LS models were equipped with the four-speed transmission only. A [[manual transmission]] was not offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/autoshows/12210/2008-chevrolet-malibu.html|title=2008 Chevrolet Malibu - Auto Shows |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All models are [[front-wheel drive|front-wheel-drive]] sedans. Chevrolet dropped the Malibu MAXX [[station wagon]] model.

Partway through the 2010 model year, the GM badges were removed from the front doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/NASApp/domestic/proddesc.jsp?year=2010&amp;butID=1&amp;regionID=1&amp;divisionID=3&amp;vehicleID=8781&amp;type=0# |title=Model Information&amp;nbsp;– Online Ordering Guide |publisher=Eogld.ecomm.gm.com |accessdate=June 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514061152/http://eogld.ecomm.gm.com/NASApp/domestic/proddesc.jsp?year=2010&amp;butID=1&amp;regionID=1&amp;divisionID=3&amp;vehicleID=8781&amp;type=0 |archivedate=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.detnews.com/article/20090825/AUTO01/908250320/1148/rss25 |title=GM to drop corporate logo from vehicles |newspaper=The Detroit News |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OnStar#Overview|OnStar]] was included on all Malibu models as standard equipment (excluding fleet vehicles, where this feature is optional). Six air bags were also standard on the seventh generation Malibu; two dual-stage front bags, two side-impact curtain air bags protecting the heads of both front and rear passengers, and two side-impact thorax bags mounted in the front seats. [[Traction control system|Traction control]], electronic [[tire pressure monitoring system]], four-wheel [[disc brakes]], [[antilock brakes]], and [[daytime running lamps]] were standard included safety features on all Malibus. GM's [[StabiliTrak]] brand [[electronic stability control]] was standard on all models including the very base LS model.

In 2011, the base LS 1LS Malibu gained more standard features, like Bluetooth technology with stereo audio playback capability, a remote USB and iPod/iPhone port, remote start, a security alarm, an upgraded OnStar system, power front driver's seat, chrome hubcap wheel covers, body-colored side mirrors with power adjustments and body-colored accents, a single wood dashboard accent, tinted windows, and a six-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and manual shift capabilities. The LT 1LT model lost its available eight-speaker Bose premium sound system. The LT 2LT got a package that included a sunroof, leather power heated seats, and more convenience and comfort features.
For 2011, the four-speed automatic transmission was dropped from the Malibu powertrain lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.leftlanenews.com/2011-chevrolet-malibu-loses-four-speed-automatic.html|title=2011 Chevrolet Malibu loses four-speed automatic|work=Leftlanenews|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same model year also saw the deletion of the steering wheel mounted paddle shifters on 6AT cars in favor of a selector mounted rocker switch for manual operation; no reason was ever given for the change.

===Reception===
The 2008 Malibu received critical praise from the automotive press, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' referring to it as being "like a super [[Honda Accord|Accord]], but from GM" and ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine declaring, "[[Toyota Camry|Camry]], Beware." It also garnered high praise from ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine, being rated higher than the Honda Accord and [[Nissan Altima]] in the magazine's 2008 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of The Year]] competition. Kelley Blue Book named it the "2008 best redesigned vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mediaroom.kbb.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=21|title=Kelley Blue Book's Kbb.Com Names Chevrolet Malibu '2008 Best Redesigned Vehicle' |publisher=KBB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car and Driver stated that while it would not be "enough to steal the top-dog sales title from the perennial Honda and Toyota mid-sizers", they noted "for the first time since Chevrolet revived the storied nameplate in 1997, it has enough of what it needs to sell in significant numbers to the public, not just rental fleets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/family_four_doors/2008_chevrolet_malibu_lt_short_take_road_test+t-engine_choices+page-3.html |title=2008 Chevrolet Malibu LT - Short Take Road Test - Engine Choices |publisher=Car and Driver |date=March 23, 2008 |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MALIBU INTERIOR.jpg|thumbnail|right|Interior]]

While [[Robert Cumberford]], design critic at [[Automobile (magazine)|''Automobile'']] magazine noted the interior of the platform-variant, the [[Saturn Aura]] featured cheap interior materials, he noted improved in the Malibu.&lt;ref name = "Automobile"&gt;Automobile Magazine: By Design, [[Robert Cumberford]], December 2006 issue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNN"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Valdes-Dapena, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url= http://money.cnn.com/2006/10/02/autos/saturn_aura/index.htm?postversion=2006100417 |title=Saturn Aura aims high, scores big. CNN Money |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=October 10, 2006 |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers of various reviews{{who|date=February 2015}} for the 2008 Malibu believed Chevrolet would be getting back on track in quality and excitement in the mid-size segment after a history of ordinary, bland offerings, such as the [[Chevrolet Celebrity|Celebrity]], [[Chevrolet Corsica|Corsica]], [[Chevrolet Lumina|Lumina]], and even the previous two generations of Malibu since its 1997 revival.

In January 2008, the redesigned Malibu received the [[North American Car of the Year]] award at the [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit in voting among a panel of 50 automotive journalists in a field of entries, with the runners up being the 2008 Cadillac CTS and the 2008 Honda Accord. The Malibu's win marked the second straight year a car built on GM's Epsilon platform won the North American COTY award with the 2007 North American COTY award having gone to the 2007 [[Saturn Aura]].

Initial sales results were positive, with the Malibu joining the [[Cadillac CTS]] and [[Buick Enclave]] on a list of GM vehicles whose sales have exceeded expectations. The redesigned Malibu sold more than 50% more units in 2008 than in 2007, increasing GM's mid-size market share to 8.4% from 5.7%, while the Camry and Accord percentages remained flat at about 21% and 17.5%, according to GM. Sales to rental customers dropped to 27% of the total, as GM limited sales to rental fleets.&lt;ref name="article1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/corporate/investor_information/docs/sales_prod/07_12/pressrelease_0712.doc |title=GM Reports 323,453 December Deliveries |publisher=GM |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219095310/http://www.gm.com/corporate/investor_information/docs/sales_prod/07_12/pressrelease_0712.doc |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short-lived Malibu Hybrid, along with its sister, the [[Saturn Aura]] Green Line, which share the powertrain and other major components, was particularly criticized due to its lack of fuel savings and cost (relative to a standard 4-cylinder Malibu), plus the Hybrid's worsened driving dynamics.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/09q1/2010_ford_fusion_hybrid_vs._camry_hybrid_altima_hybrid_and_malibu_hybrid-comparison_tests |title=2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid vs. Camry Hybrid, Altima Hybrid, and Malibu Hybrid - Comparison Tests |publisher=Caranddriver.com |accessdate=April 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729182946/http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/09q1/2010_ford_fusion_hybrid_vs._camry_hybrid_altima_hybrid_and_malibu_hybrid-comparison_tests |archive-date=July 29, 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2012. General Motors recalled 473,841 vehicles involving the Chevrolet Malibu, [[Pontiac G6]] and [[Saturn Aura]] from model years 2007 through 2010 equipped with four-speed automatic transmissions.

The eighth generation Malibu was available in the trim levels LS 1LS (not available for fleet-ordered models), the LT 1LT (this is the base model for fleet-ordered models), the LT 2LT, the ECO 1SB, the ECO 2SA, and the LTZ 1LZ. Both ECO models officially went on sale in the spring of 2012, with the gas-only models following in late summer 2012. The Turbo models followed in early 2013.

All models, aside from the LS 1LS, were equipped with a large touch-screen display using Chevrolet's [[MyLink]] and offering [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] Internet Radio playback capabilities via a USB cable and an iPhone 4, 4S, or 5. [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link was also included on all navigation-equipped Malibu models.

===Safety features===
Standard safety features on the eighth generation Malibu include dual-stage front airbags for the driver and front passenger, along with pelvic/thorax side-impact and knee airbags up front also. Roof rail airbags with rollover protection are standard. Also available as option extras are second-row head/thorax side-impact airbags, [[lane departure warning system]] with forward collision alert and a rearview camera system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themotorreport.com.au/51697/2012-chevrolet-malibu-revealed-previews-holden-malibu The Motor Report], Holden Malibu Shown as 2012 Chevrolet Malibu.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
In a March 2012 comparison test by Car and Driver, the “light electrification" Chevrolet Malibu Eco hybrid came in sixth place out of six cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2013-chevrolet-malibu-eco-vs-2012-honda-accord-ex-l-2012-hyundai-sonata-se-2012-kia-optima-ex-2012-toyota-camry-se-2012-volkswagen-passat-25-se-comparison-tests |title=2013 Chevrolet Malibu Eco vs. 2012 Honda Accord EX-L, 2012 Hyundai Sonata SE, 2012 Kia Optima EX, 2012 Toyota Camry SE, 2012 Volkswagen Passat 2.5 SE }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eco is not a Malibu LS, LT, or LTZ. The Malibu Eco was criticized for its reduced wheelbase, causing a 0.8" reduction in legroom for back seat passengers. The interior was also criticized for being disappointing and cramped. The ride, however, was said to be smooth and quiet, with the only problem being the stiff steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-chevrolet-malibu-25-liter-first-drive-reviews |title=2013 Chevrolet Malibu 2.5 L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 Chevrolet Malibu received the highest score in its class from J.D. Power's 2014 Initial Quality Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://autos.jdpower.com/ratings/quality.htm|title=2014 Initial Quality Study (IQS) Ratings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IQS study "examines problems experienced by vehicle owners during the first 90 days of ownership." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2014-us-initial-quality-study-iqs |title=Initial Quality Problems Increase as Automakers Struggle to Launch Vehicles with Technology That Consumers Find Easy to Use}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen months after the 2013 Malibu's debut, it received a mild refresh. The changes included additional technology, improved fuel economy, and front-end styling that more closely matched the refreshed [[Chevrolet Traverse]] and the newly redesigned [[Chevrolet Impala]]. Minor changes were made to the center console to deliver a longer armrest said to be more comfortable and a pair of cup holders and mobile-phone bins instead of the previous covered storage area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Car and Driver|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-malibu-photos-and-info-news}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese model received a refreshed front end with revised [[headlamp]]s.{{CN|date=March 2020}}

Among the technology that Chevrolet debuted on the 2014 Malibu was a new six-speed transmission. Because the transmission was designed to reduce the energy required to pump transmission fluid, it contributed to fuel savings on the refreshed Malibu. In addition, for the first time in a non-hybrid GM vehicle, an engine stop/start system came standard with the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewdepaula/2013/08/31/2014-chevrolet-malibu-gets-standard-stopstart-technology/ "The 2014 Chevrolet Malibu Makes Stop/Start Technology Standard (And Why It Matters)"] from ''Forbes'' (August 31, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; EPA fuel-economy estimates showed an improvement to 25/36 mpg city/highway, up from the 2013 model's 22/34 for the base 2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel Economy.Gov|url= http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=32970&amp;id=34311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Malibu was available for purchase in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Chevrolet Malibu Spy Photos|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-malibu-spy-photos-news|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2015, Chevrolet unveiled a redesigned Malibu at the 2015 [[New York Auto Show]], which went on sale in late 2015 as a 2016 model. The updated Malibu featured a sleeker, yet larger design similar to its full sized Impala. The wheelbase was increased almost four inches, creating more interior space; but the fuel efficiency is improved, as it is nearly 300 pounds lighter than the eighth generation model.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewdepaula/2015/04/30/2016-chevrolet-malibu-improves-by-leaps-and-bounds/#3d0b85495a96 |title=The High-Tech 2016 Chevy Malibu Is Significantly Better Than Before |first=Matthew |last=de Paula |work=Forbes |date=April 30, 2015 |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 Malibu was offered in four trims: L, LS, LT, and Premier (replacing the LTZ trim).

[[File:2017 Chevrolet Malibu LT rear 3.27.18.jpg|thumb|left|2017 Chevrolet Malibu (rear)]]

The Malibu features an all-new, [[GM Small Gasoline Engine|LFV Ecotec]] 1.5L turbo that is standard, while a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged engine is offered as an optional feature. No six-cylinder engine is available. Other new features on the ninth-generation Malibu that were introduced for the 2016 model year include available [[OnStar]] 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] in-vehicle connectivity, as well as available [[Inductive charging|wireless phone charging]], preventive safety technologies including ten standard air bags featuring forward [[collision avoidance system]] rear cross traffic alerts, and an optional [[automatic parking]] assist. It features Forward Collision Alert with Following Distance Indicator, Adaptive Cruise Control with Front Automatic Braking, and Front Pedestrian Alert with last-second automatic braking.&lt;ref name=GM2016Malibu&gt;{{cite web|url= http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/malibu/2016.html |title=2016 Malibu |publisher=Media.gm.com |date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also installed with [[Start-stop system#General Motors|start-stop]] ignition once the engine is at operating temperature and the brake is applied while the vehicle is stopped.

[[File:Chevrolet Malibu 2017 Interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior]]
The 2016 Malibu features a first for the automotive industry, a teen driver feature, which allows parents to view their kids' driving statistics, such as maximum speed, warning alerts and more.&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt; To operate the vehicle a parent enables the feature with a PIN in the settings menu of the Malibu's MyLink system, which allows them to register their teen's key fob.

However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927225/apple-carplays-coming-to-these-14-chevrolet-cars-in-the-2016-model-year.html "Apple CarPlay's coming to these 14 Chevrolet cars in the 2016 model year"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927293/these-are-the-14-chevrolet-cars-from-the-2016-model-year-that-will-have-android-auto.html "These are the 14 Chevrolet cars from the 2016 model year that will have Android Auto"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months ahead of the 2016 model arriving in dealerships, Chevrolet announced that the Malibu had hit a milestone, with more than 10 million sold worldwide since the car was introduced 51 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewdepaula/2015/08/31/chevy-malibu-godfather-of-family-sedans-surpasses-10-million-sales-as-new-2016-model-approaches/ "Chevy Malibu, Godfather Of Family Sedans, Hits Milestone As New 2016 Model Approaches"] from ''Forbes'' (August 31, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; China and South Korea are currently the only two countries outside of North America where the 2016 Malibu is sold.

===Hybrid version===
[[File:Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid badge WAS 2017 1514.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] badge]]

The ninth generation Malibu offers a [[hybrid vehicle drivetrain#Full hybrids|full hybrid]] model for the first time, featuring a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L four-cylinder engine mated to a two-motor drive unit and electronically-controlled, continuously-variable automatic transaxle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Service Insights pg23 |url=https://gmserviceinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Service-Insights-Vol-3-2016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing additional power to assist the engine during acceleration for 182 horsepower of total system power. An Exhaust Gas Heat Recovery system allows the engine and cabin to warm up during winter conditions, while an 80-cell, 1.5 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]] pack provides electric power to the hybrid system, powering the Malibu Hybrid up to {{convert|55|mph|abbr=on}} on electricity alone, while the gasoline-powered engine automatically comes on at higher speeds and loads to provide additional power. The Malibu Hybrid uses a transmission ("two motor drive unit" in GM terms) similar to the [[Chevrolet Volt (second generation)|second generation Chevrolet Volt]],&lt;ref name=GM2016Malibu/&gt; but a much smaller battery, no plug-in option and a different engine.

The following table compares the fuel economy for all variants of the 2016 [[model year]] Malibu.

The Hybrid version will be discontinued in 2020 due to decreasing sales, leaving Chevrolet without hybrid cars in their North American lineup, only gasoline versions of it. Their electric offering, the [[Chevrolet Bolt|Bolt]], is still on sale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motorpasion.com.mx/industria/oficial-chevrolet-malibu-hybrid-desaparece-2020&lt;/ref&gt;

===2019 mid-cycle refresh===

The Premier trim adds LED headlamps while the L/LS/RS/LT/Hybrid trims maintain halogen headlamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2019 Order Guide |url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2019-Chevrolet-Malibu-order-guide-July-27-2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new RS trim-line is added for a sportier appearance, with a black grille, unique 18-inch wheels, and dual exhaust.  The touchscreen is replaced with the 8-inch Chevrolet Infotainment 3 in the L/LS/RS/LT trims and Chevrolet Infortainment 3 Plus with HD screen in the Hybrid and Premier trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2019 Order Guide |url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2019-Chevrolet-Malibu-order-guide-July-27-2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heated Second Row Seats are added to the Premier trim.

The '''Chevrolet Suburban''' is a [[full-size]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] from [[Chevrolet]]. The name started in 1934 for the 1935 U.S. model year making it the longest continuously used [[automobile]] [[Nameplate (automotive)|nameplate]] in production.  It has traditionally been one of General Motors' most profitable vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/trucks/g212/chevy-suburbuan-historical-pictures/|title=Everybody Loves the Suburban|date=August 27, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1935 first generation Carryall Suburban was one of the first production all-metal bodied station wagons.&lt;ref name=myautoworld/&gt;

The Chevrolet Suburban was additionally produced under the GMC marque until the GMS version was rebranded '''Yukon XL'''.  It was also also briefly marketed as a [[Holden]]. For most of its recent history, the Suburban has been a [[station wagon]]-bodied version of the [[List of Chevrolet pickup trucks|Chevrolet pickup truck]], including the [[Chevrolet C/K]] and [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado]] series of truck-based vehicles. [[Cadillac]] offers a version called the [[Cadillac Escalade ESV|Escalade ESV]].

The Suburban is sold in the United States, Canada, Central America, Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, Myanmar, Laos, Angola, the Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel) while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (exclusive to United States and Canada; Mexico to start in 2020) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).

A 2018 iSeeCars.com study identified the Chevrolet Suburban as the car that is driven the most each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blackley |first1=Julie |title=The Cars People Drive the Most |url=https://www.iseecars.com/most-driven-cars-study |website=iSeeCars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2019 [[iSeeCars.com]] study named the Chevrolet Suburban the second-ranked longest-lasting vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.iseecars.com/longest-lasting-cars-2019-study/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524042759/https://www.iseecars.com/longest-lasting-cars-2019-study |archive-date=May 24, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2019, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce unveiled a [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star for the Suburban, noting that the Suburban had been in "1,750 films and TV shows since 1952."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Paul A. |title=The latest celeb to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is... the Chevy Suburban |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/latest-celeb-get-star-hollywood-walk-fame-chevy-suburban-n1097101 |accessdate=29 January 2020 |agency=NBC News |date=7 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30152850/chevy-suburban-walk-of-fame/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several automotive companies in the United States used the "Suburban" designation to indicate a windowed, station wagon type body on a commercial frame including [[DeSoto Suburban|DeSoto]], [[Dodge]], [[Plymouth Suburban|Plymouth]], [[Studebaker]], [[Nash Motors|Nash]], [[Chevrolet]], and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]. The (Westchester) Suburban name was, in fact, a trademark of U.S. Body and Forging Co. of [[Tell City, Indiana]], which built wooden station wagon bodies for all of these automobile and light truck chassis and more.

Chevrolet began production of its all-steel "carryall-suburban" in 1934.&lt;ref name=myautoworld/&gt; [[GMC Truck|GMC]] brought out its version in 1937. These vehicles were also known as the "Suburban Carryall" until GM shortened the name to simply "Suburban". GMC's equivalent to the Chevrolet model was originally named "Suburban" as well, until being rebranded as "Yukon XL" for the 2000 model year.

With the end of production of the [[Dodge Town Wagon]] in 1966 and the [[Plymouth Fury Suburban]] station wagon in 1978, only [[General Motors]] continued to manufacture a vehicle branded as a "Suburban", and GM was awarded an exclusive trademark on the name in 1988. The Chevrolet Suburban is one of the largest SUVs on the market today. It has outlasted competitive vehicles such as the [[Travelall|International Harvester Travelall]], [[Jeep Wagoneer]], and the [[Ford Excursion]]. The latest competitor is the extended [[Ford Expedition|Ford Expedition EL]], which replaced the Excursion.

The Suburban of today is a full-size SUV (upgraded to extended length from 1967 onward to make room for the then-new K5 Blazer that debuted in 1969) with three rows of seating, a full [[pickup truck]] frame, and [[V8 engine]]. It is one of the few [[station wagon]]s available with all bench rows. The Suburban is the same height and width as the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]], although the Suburban is {{convert|20|in|mm}} longer. The extra length provides a full-sized cargo area behind the 9 passenger seating area. From 1973 to 2013 it had been available in half-ton and 3/4-ton versions, the latter discontinued after the 2013 model year, but was revived in 2015 as a fleet-exclusive vehicle for the 2016 model year.

In recent years, the Suburban has been used as a [[police truck]], [[fire chief's vehicle]], or [[Emergency Medical Services|EMS]] [[vehicle]]. Suburbans are also used as [[limousines]]. Gothic black Suburban vehicles are commonly used by federal intelligence services, such as [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] for example. Secret Service operates fully armored versions of the Suburban for the [[President of the United States]] when he attends less formal engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicles used by Secret Service|url=http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/fedcars/ss3.html|publisher=Government Police Cars Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Suburban (as well as the Tahoe and GMC variants) is very popular with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] as a service vehicle.

In the late 1990s, GM also introduced a [[Right hand drive|RHD]] version of the Suburban, badged as a [[Holden]], for the Australian market. Sales were low and GM withdrew the model in 2000 from Holden's lineup.

In 2015, the Suburban commemorated its 80th anniversary at [[General Motors]] Arlington Assembly Plant where the 10 millionth Suburban was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2015/mar/0325-suburban.html|title=Arlington 10 Million Celebration Adds to Suburban’s Legacy|work=media.gm.com|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video was posted on Chevrolet's YouTube channel about its eighty-year legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chevrolet|title=Chevy Suburban Anniversary: 80 Years of Power, Utility &amp; More {{!}} Chevrolet|date=2015-03-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig2GhR_KPmc|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In a February 26, 2018 article celebrating the vehicle's 83rd year, ''Car and Driver'' notes that the Suburban's longevity is due to being one of GM's best selling brands, its appeal to customers across the board regardless of race, gender, class, or political affiliation, and a unique loyalty to the SUV. In an interview from Chevrolet's truck/SUV marketing executive Sandor Piszar, who recalls an event celebrating the truck division's 100th anniversary when they asked about what they named their vehicles, “It’s a funny question, but it really is an intriguing point,” Piszar says. “People name what they love. And they love their Suburbans.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.caranddriver.com/the-social-history-of-the-chevrolet-suburban/ “The Social History of the Chevrolet Suburban”] from Car and Driver (February 26, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2019, The Chevrolet Suburban became the first vehicle to be awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] by the [[Hollywood Chamber of Commerce]] for its excellence in film and television, having appeared in more than 1,750 films and television series since 1952, and can also claim to have appeared in at least one television series every year since 1956, and at least one film every year since 1960, the most ever for an automobile of any type. The star, placed at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, will also carry the Chevrolet "Bowtie" symbol instead of the entertainment symbols (film, stage, television, radio, musical instruments, and recording artist), another first for the Walk of Fame.&lt;ref name="freep.com"&gt;[https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/12/05/chevrolet-suv-hollywood-walk-fame/2623751001/ "Chevrolet SUV becomes the first vehicle with a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame"] from ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' (December 6, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a total of twelve generations of Chevrolet Suburbans since its 1934 debut, the latest due to go on sale in spring 2020 as a 2021 model.

Prior to this first generation Suburban, in 1933 Chevrolet had offered a [[station wagon]] body, built on the 1/2 ton truck frame. This model was specifically built for [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] units. Much of the body was constructed from wood, and could seat up to eight occupants.

The actual first generation model was offered by Chevrolet as a "Carryall Suburban" – a tough, no-nonsense load carrier featuring a station wagon body on the chassis of a small truck. Focused on functionality, the concept was literally to "carry all": the whole family and their gear were to find sufficient space in one truck.&lt;ref name=myautoworld/&gt; It shared the front sheetmetal and frames of the 1/2 ton pickup models of the same year, but featured all-metal wagon bodies differing very little in shape from contemporary "woodie" wagons. Seating for up to eight occupants was available, with three in front row, two in the middle row, and three in the rear row. Either the side-hinged rear panel doors or a rear [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|tailgate]]/lift window could be selected for cargo area access.&lt;ref name=myautoworld&gt;[http://myautoworld.com/gm/history/suburban/suburban.html 1936 to 2010 Chevrolet Suburban – My Autoworld]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suburbans were built in model years 1941, 1942, and 1946. It was also produced during the war as a military transport vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-suburban-evolution-of-an-icon/|title=Chevrolet Suburban: Evolution of an Icon|date=April 2, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dammann 1972"/&gt; Seating for up to eight occupants was available.

The GMC version was equipped with a [[GMC Straight-6 engine|228-cubic-inch 6-cylinder engine]]. It shared much of its mechanicals with the [[Chevrolet AK Series|AK Series]] trucks.

This model generation was based on the [[Chevrolet Advance Design]] series of pickups.

Beginning in 1953, the [[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]] 4-speed [[automatic transmission]] was available in GMC models and in the 1954 model year Chevrolet Suburbans. Models with rear panel doors were designated "3106," while those with tailgates were designated "3116." In 1952, the Suburban came with either a tailgate or panel doors.&lt;ref name="Dammann 1972"/&gt; The front bench seat was split, with two seats on the driver's side and a single seat on the passenger side, which slid forward for access to the rear two rows of seats. The second row was a "2/3" seat, requiring occupants to move past the front passenger seat, as well as the second-row seats to access the third row.

This was the last series to feature "[[Canopy express]]" models.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The design of the 1947 Suburban would inspire the design of the [[Chevrolet HHR]] over half a century later.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Updated engineering and styling on Chevrolet trucks was not introduced until March 25, 1955, in the middle of the model year that GM called the [[Chevrolet Task Force|Chevrolet Task Force/GMC Blue Chip]] series. All Chevrolet and GMC truck models received new styling that included a flatter hood, front fenders flush with the body, and a trapezoid grill.&lt;ref name="Dammann 1972"/&gt; The trucks' V-shaped speedometer was shared with passenger car models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1955_Trucks-and_Vans/1955_Chevrolet_Truck_Operators_Manual/1955%20Chev%20Truck%20Manual-04.html |title=1955 Chevrolet Truck Operators Manual |page=4 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engines included [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine|I-6]] and the small block V8s.
Chevrolet used its [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|265 V8]] engine, later evolving it to a 283-cubic-inch version. GMC based their V8 on a [[Pontiac V8 engine|Pontiac]] design. Standard Suburban model numbers continued from the previous series, but the introduction of four-wheel-drive models in 1957 added the numbers "3156" for 4WD Suburbans with panel doors, and "3166" for 4WD Suburbans with tailgates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Chevrolet-Suburban-Overview-d638|title=Chevrolet Suburban|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/1506-chevy-suburban-spotters-guide-suv-bio/ "Chevy Suburban Spotter's Guide – SUV Bio"] from Four Wheeler (April 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Suburban" name was also used on GM's fancy 2-door GMC 100 series pickup trucks from 1955–1959, called the Suburban Pickup, which was similar to the [[Chevrolet Cameo Carrier]], but it was dropped at the same time as Chevy's Cameo in March 1958 when GM released the new all-steel "Fleetside" bed option replacing the Cameo / Suburban Pickup fiberglass bedsides. The Suburban name was never used again on a 1/2 ton pickup after the discontinuance of the Suburban Pickup. Although not documented due to a fire which destroyed the records, the production of Suburban Pickups is understood to be 300 or fewer each model year it was offered from 1955–1958.

The styling of the 1960 – 1961 model year took cues from the late 1950s Chevrolet vehicles and had large oval ports above the grille. Front independent suspension was new for 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/GM-Trucks-and-Vans/1960_Trucks_and_Vans/1960-Chevrolet-Suburban-Brochure/1960-Chevrolet-Suburban-04 |title=1960 Chevrolet Suburban |page=4 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=October 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610014942/http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/NA/GM-Trucks-and-Vans/1960_Trucks_and_Vans/1960-Chevrolet-Suburban-Brochure/1960-Chevrolet-Suburban-04 |archive-date=June 10, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cab featured a "wrap around" windshield, while tailgate and panel door rear openings were available.

From 1962 onwards, the hood styling was more conservative, with hoods that eliminated the large ports. In 1964, the front glass area was updated to a flatter windshield and larger door glass. {{convert|1150|lb|abbr=on}} of cargo could be carried in the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1964_Trucks_and_Vans/1964_Chevrolet_Suburban_Brochure/1964%20Chev%20Suburban-02.html|title=1964 Chevrolet Suburban Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model series introduced a factory-equipped 4WD ("K") option for the first time. The 2WD ("C") models introduced a [[torsion bar]]-based independent front suspension and trailing arm and coil spring rear, but by 1963, returned to a more conventional coil-spring approach.

Engine options included [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine|I-6]] and [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|small-block V8s]]. A {{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[GMC V6 engine]] was also available on GMC models. This 305 was actually from GMCs medium-duty truck line. It featured high torque but was also notable for poor fuel economy. Transmissions were a 3-speed and 4-speed manual, the automatic Powerglide and the dual-range Hydramatic in the GMC models.

A 15-passenger conversion was done by Stageway of Fort Smith, Ark. These modified Suburbans had three doors on the right, a {{convert|171|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase, were {{convert|273|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} long, and weighed {{convert|6300|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Dammann 1972"/&gt;

One ton (C-30), {{convert|10|ft|m|0|adj=on}} panel truck models were no longer available after 1966.

The 6th generation Suburbans featured a single driver-side door and two passenger-side doors, and were available in both [[Rear-wheel drive|2WD]] and [[Four-wheel drive|4WD]] models.

Engines offered over the six model years included the 250 and 292 CI inline 6, 283, 307, 327, and 350 CI small block V-8, and 396/402 CI big block V-8. For the first time, a three-quarter ton version was available. It also became a larger size vehicle as well with the introduction of the K5 Blazer that debuted in 1968 for the 1969 model year.

This series would also be the last to offer C-10 &amp; C-20 [[panel truck]] models for commercial purposes, with 1970 as the last year.

1971 models featured disc brakes on the front wheels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Suburban_Brochure/1971%20Chevy%20Suburban-05.html |title=1971 Chevrolet Suburban Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1972 was the last year for coil-spring rear suspension on 2WD models. 1972 also introduced a smaller housing for the rear seat air conditioning (a unit that ran the full length of the roof had been available since 1967). The Comfort-Tilt steering wheel became optional in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Suburban_Brochure/1971%20Chevy%20Suburban-07.html |title=1971 Chevrolet Suburban Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation of Suburban coincided with the rapid growth of the recreational vehicle market. While only about 6,200 Suburbans were produced in 1967, by 1972 that number had grown to some 27,000.

=== Chevrolet Veraneio (Brazil) ===
[[File:Chevrolet Veraneio front left.jpg|thumb|left|1972–1978 Chevrolet Veraneio|alt=Front view, from the right, of a green 1971+ Chevrolet Veraneio]]
In 1964, Chevrolet in [[Brazil]] introduced a 5-door version of the Suburban called '''C-1416''' (known as '''Veraneio''' from 1969 onwards, which is Portuguese for "summertime"). It was based on the contemporary Brazilian Chevrolet '''C-14'''. Like the C-14, the C-1416/Veraneio used the instrument cluster from the US C/K series although the exterior sheet metal layout is exclusive to Brazil. It was initially powered with a Chevrolet 4.2 L inline six based on the pre-1962 "Stovebolt" engines. Later it used the 250-cid 4.1 L engine from Chevrolet's Brazilian mid-size sedan – the [[Chevrolet Opala|Opala]]. The original version of the Veraneio was kept in production, with another grille and interior, until 1988 (model year 1989), but it was eventually replaced with an updated version based on the '''[[Chevrolet D-20|Série 20]]''' family.&lt;ref name="Veraneio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexicarbrasil.com.br/chevrolet/#attachment_2949 |title=Chevrolet |access-date=February 20, 2015 |publisher=Lexicar Brazil |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation of Veraneio was produced from 1989 to 1995.

In 1997 GM introduced in Brazil the North American pickups for the local market, replacing the "C Series". The Brazilian version of the Suburban was also converted to the current generation at the time and lasted until 2001, was called the Grand Blazer, a successor to the Veraneio. The 4.1 L inline six engine with {{convert|138|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was offered on both models with option for a MWM 4.2 L turbodiesel unit with {{convert|168|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

In 2015, ''[[Autoweek]]'' ranked the Veraneio fourth among the Chevrolet station wagons that America never got. It also cited the vehicle's design as "baroque" and summed it up as "It's a 1960s Brazilian crossover." Autoweek notes that The Veraneio can be imported to the United States, depending on the condition of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autoweek.com/article/classic-cars/7-chevrolet-station-wagons-america-never-got "7 Chevrolet station wagons America never got"] from ''Autoweek'' (September 15, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1973 model year the base engine was the 250 CID inline six (100 net HP), with a 307 or 350-cubic-inch small block V8 (115 or 155 net), or the new-for-1973 454 CID big block V8 (240 net HP) optional. The 307 V8 was dropped for 1974, supplanted by the 305 and 400 small block V8's in 1976. The 400 was dropped after 1980, leaving the 350 as the only available engine in K-series Suburbans as the 454 was not yet offered in 4x4's. In 1982 a new {{convert|379|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]] was available, producing 130 horsepower and 240 lb.-ft. of torque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradok5.com/brochures/1982/burb2.jpg |title=1982 Chevy Suburban (brochure) |publisher=Chevrolet Motor Division |date=August 1981 |page=2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214065927/http://www.coloradok5.com/brochures/1982/burb2.jpg |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diesel later became the engine of choice for Suburbans exported to Europe from USA. Except for the discontinuation of the 305 V8 in '88 the engine line-up continued mostly unchanged, with the 350, 454, and 6.2 diesel, until the Suburban was redesigned onto the GMT400 chassis in 1992.

Three-speed [[Turbo Hydra-Matic]] 350 and 400 [[automatic transmission]]s were available, and the four-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 700R4 was introduced in 1981 and was available with the small block and 6.2-liter diesel. Towing packages, with lower axle ratio and heavy-duty cooling additions, were optional.

Trim options included base (Scottsdale) level and upgraded Silverado versions. An optional 3rd row bench seat allowed for nine-passenger configurations. A rear heating system was optional.

For model year 1981, automatic locking front hubs were added for shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive models, and the NP208 transfer case replaced the NP205 in most models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradok5.com/brochures/1981/burb5.jpg |title=1981 Chevy Suburban (brochure) |publisher=Chevrolet Motor Division |date=July 1980 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214065920/http://www.coloradok5.com/brochures/1981/burb5.jpg |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1984, asbestos was removed from rear brakes. For 1985, a new grille was used.&lt;ref name="gunnell1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet Trucks|year=1995|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=978-0-87341-364-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 64,670 Suburbans were made in 1985.&lt;ref name="gunnell1995"/&gt;

For model year 1987, the method of fuel delivery for the engines was switched from [[carburetor]]s to [[electronic fuel injection]].  (However, for the 454 cubic inch or 7.4 liter displacement engine, carburetors were still made available along with electronic fuel injection for the 1987–1989 model years).&lt;ref&gt;See the 1997 ACDelco Spark Plug catalog, pp. 181–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The system that GM chose was called ''[[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|throttle body injection]]'', or TBI. Suburban gained rear-wheel [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) for the 1990 model year. A heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmission, the [[GM 4L80-E transmission|4L80-E]] was added for 1991. Also for 1989, the grille was redesigned to accommodate a quad side-by-side headlight setup and larger marker lights/turn signals than the previous dual filament single headlight setup, which was styled concurrently with the GMT400 light duty trucks. Economy models (usually for fleet usage) were available with only two headlights (again, based on the base model C/K series).

[[General Motors|GM]] temporarily changed the usual "[[Chevrolet C/K|C/K]]" designation to "R" and "V" for the 1987 through 1991 model years. This was done to avoid confusion with the GMT400-based [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickup trucks, which were introduced in 1987, during the overlap period.

[[File:1997 Chevrolet Suburban 5.7 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
The GMT400-based Suburbans were introduced in December 1991 for the 1992 model year. The similar [[pickup truck]] models had switched to the newer platforms in the 1988 model year. Both 2WD and 4WD models, designated "C" and "K", were offered, as well as half ton and three-quarter ton ("1500" and "2500") models.

The base engine for all variants was the [[Chevrolet small-block V8|small-block 5.7 liter (350&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in) V8]]. The [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine|big-block 7.4&amp;nbsp;L (454&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in) V8]] was optional for the 2500 series. The optional [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine|6.5 L Turbo diesel]] was available on all models – though rare on the 1500 series. The 6.5 L Turbo diesel used in the Tahoe was detuned to {{convert|380|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque due to the limitation of the {{convert|8.5|in|mm|adj=on}} axle capacity. 1500 Suburbans with the 6.5 L Turbo diesel used the 14 bolt axle from the 2500 series. Ground clearance was 6.9&amp;nbsp;inches, the approach angle was 18 degrees for the K-1500 (28 degrees for the K-2500) and the break over angle was 18 degrees.&lt;ref name="delong1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLong|first=Brad|title=4-Wheel Freedom|year=1996|publisher=Paladin Press|isbn=978-0-87364-891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmissions included the ''[[GM 4L60-E transmission|4L60]]'' four-speed automatic in the 1500 series, and the heavier duty ''[[GM 4L80-E transmission|4L80]]'' four-speed automatic in the 2500 series and the 1500 series fitted with the 6.5 L Turbo diesel. The manual transmission option from the previous generation was dropped.

The GMT400 series introduced [[independent front suspension]]. The 2WD models used [[coil spring]]s and 4WD models used [[torsion bar]]s in the front suspension. All models used a [[live axle]] and [[leaf spring]]s in the rear.

0–60&amp;nbsp;mph time for a 1995 Suburban was 9.3&amp;nbsp;seconds. Top speed of a 1995 Suburban is governed on the engine for economy. A maximum of {{convert|98|mph|abbr=on}} can be obtained.&lt;ref name="delong1996"/&gt; City fuel economy was {{convert|13|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="delong1996"/&gt; and highway was {{convert|15|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="delong1996"/&gt; while the turning circle was {{convert|47.8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="delong1996"/&gt; In 1996, fuel economy had improved to {{convert|17|mpgus|L/100km|abbr=on}} highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&amp;id=29550&amp;id=13133&amp;id=13195|title=Compare Side-by-Side |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trim options included a base-level version, the LS, and the LT. Interior seating arrangements allowed for either bucket or bench seating in the first row, and optional third row bench. The vehicle could be configured from two- to nine-passenger seating.

Beginning in 1994, GM began making numerous annual changes to the Suburban, including:
* Revised front clip and center stop lamp (1994)
* Revised interior including a driver-side [[air bag]], revised side mirrors (1995)
* Revised ''[[General Motors small-block engine#L31|Vortec L31]]'' (350 cu. in.) and ''[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#Vortec|Vortec 7400]]'' (454 cu. in) engines with increased [[power (physics)|power]] and [[fuel efficiency]], electronic 4WD shifting, [[daytime running lights]], illuminated entry, and some new interior features (1996)
* Revised transmissions, improved steering system and added passenger-side air bag (1997)
* [[Onstar]], PassLock security system and full-time AutoTrac 4WD option added, next generation "depowered" air bags, revised steering wheel, transmissions revised again (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Motors Passlock Security System|url=http://passlock.bloggstar.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No major changes upon introduction of redesigned 2000 models (1999)

[[File:1998 Holden Suburban 1500 V8 5.7.jpg|thumb|right|Holden Suburban (K8) 1500, New Zealand model]]

In Australia and New Zealand, [[Holden]] imported the [[driving on the left or right|right-hand drive]] Chevrolet Suburban built by GM in [[Silao]], Mexico, between February 1998 and January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = May 10, 2001 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/CCFB67BA3E9FCE77CA256A480019218D | title = Car review – Holden Suburban 1500 LT 5-dr wagon | website = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Suburban was first previewed in October 1997 at the [[Australian International Motor Show|Sydney Motor Show]].&lt;ref name="heritage3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Tony |author2=Kennedy, Alistair |author3=Kennedy, Ewan |date=February 2007 |url=http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part3.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Holden Heritage – 13th Edition (Part Three) |publisher=[[Holden|GM Holden]] |pages=109 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326064656/http://media.gmcanada.com:8221/aus/holden/en/company/history/HH13Part3.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 746 were sold (460 petrol and 286 diesel).&lt;ref name="Used Car Advice: Holden Suburban (1998-2000)"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | date = June 26, 2007 | url = http://www.carsales.com.au/advice/2007/large-4x4/holden/suburban/used-car-advice-holden-suburban-19982000-7457 | title = Used Car Advice: Holden Suburban (1998–2000) | publisher = Carsales | accessdate = October 6, 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130121447/http://www.carsales.com.au/advice/2007/large-4x4/holden/suburban/used-car-advice-holden-suburban-19982000-7457 | archivedate = November 30, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2001, subsequent models reverted to the original Chevrolet brand, which had also been used before 1998. Over the model's lifetime there were three trim levels: a base model, the LS and the LT. Not to be confused with the trim variants is the model code, designated ''K8''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redbook.com.au/used-cars/results.aspx?Ns=p_Year_String%7c0%7cp_MonthGroup_String%7c1%7cp_Make_String%7c0%7cp_ClassificationType_String%7c0%7cp_Family_String%7c0%7cp_SequenceNum_Int32%7c0&amp;N=2994%204294958234%204294843511&amp;TabId=1407342 | title = Holden Suburban | website = Red Book | publisher = Automotive Data Services | accessdate = April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holden's interior differed from that of the American version, whereby the dashboard of the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] was used instead. However, it had to be stretched on the passenger (left) side to fit in the larger Suburban. A [[bench seat]] came standard on the entry-level variant as well as the LS, but the more expensive LT received [[bucket seat]]s. With the omission of the center seat, the LT has a maximum seating capacity of eight, compared to nine.&lt;ref name = "The Car"&gt;{{cite web | date = May 10, 2001 | url = http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/C45556D9EABDA1DECA256A48001AA735 | title = Holden Suburban 1500 LT 5-dr wagon – The Car | website = GoAuto | publisher = John Mellor | accessdate = October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creature comforts standard in all models included a [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] compass in the [[rear-view mirror]], a tilt adjustable [[steering wheel]], a driver's [[airbag]], [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS brakes]], and dual-zone [[air conditioning]].&lt;ref name = "The Car"/&gt; The second tier LS brought [[alloy wheel]]s, [[power window]]s and mirrors among some features. To further up the ante, the LT gained electric front seats, leather trim, and a horizontally slated, two-part [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|tailgate]]. This came as opposed to the "barn doors" found on the other specifications.&lt;ref name="NRMA"&gt;{{cite web | date = June 1998 | url = http://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/holden_suburban_1998_car_review.htm | title = NRMA Car Review – Holden Suburban | publisher = [[NRMA]] | accessdate = October 6, 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080201003139/http://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/holden_suburban_1998_car_review.htm | archivedate = February 1, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suburban was offered with the choice of either a 5.7-liter ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#5700|Vortec]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]], producing {{convert|190|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|447|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque, or a 6.5-liter [[turbodiesel]] [[V8 engine|V8]] outputting {{convert|145|kW|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|583|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "The Car"/&gt; The former choice was designated the "1500" name, while the turbodiesel saw the "2500" identify.&lt;ref name = "NRMA"/&gt; The 5.7-liter [[gasoline engine|petrol engine]] is [[autogas|LPG]]-compatible, and such systems can be retrofitted if desired. Regardless of the engine specified, the truck was equipped with a four-speed [[automatic transmission]]. However, what differed was the type of transmission. Petrol motors were fitted with the ''[[GM 4L60-E transmission|GM 4L60-E]]'' transmission, with the ''[[GM 4L80-E transmission|GM 4L80-E]]'' reserved for the diesel.&lt;ref name = "Used Car Advice: Holden Suburban (1998-2000)"/&gt; A dashboard switch allows the vehicle to power [[Four-wheel drive|all four wheels]] simultaneously, or the [[Rear-wheel drive|rear wheels]] only, and allows the low range gearing to be engaged.&lt;ref name = "The Car"/&gt;

The vehicle's [[fuel efficiency]] has been rated at {{convert|19.7|L/100 km|mpgus|abbr=on}} for the diesel specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Carey | first = John | date = February 25, 1999 | url = http://news.drive.com.au/drive/new-car-reviews/worth-the-weight-20100824-13mrl.html | title = Worth the weight? | website = Drive | accessdate = August 13, 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055224/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/new-car-reviews/worth-the-weight-20100824-13mrl.html | archivedate = July 22, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with that figure rising to {{convert|21.8|L/100 km|mpgus|abbr=on}} for the petrol model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = February 25, 1999 | url = http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/thirst-encounter-20100823-13g33.html | title = Thirst encounter | website = Drive | accessdate = October 6, 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055242/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/thirst-encounter-20100823-13g33.html | archivedate = July 22, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the hefty fuel consumption comes a 159-liter [[fuel tank]].&lt;ref name = "The Car"/&gt;

To combat the extra payload and towing capacity of the diesel, an improved braking package, as well as super heavy duty [[axle]]s and suspension were fitted. Holden recommends a maximum {{convert|3400|kg|lb}} towing limit for the turbo diesels, with a reduced figure of {{convert|2720|kg|lb}} for the petrol models.&lt;ref name = "The Car"/&gt;

The Holden Suburban's run actually wasn't the first or only time that Holden had sold the GMT400 platform in Oceania.  Beginning in 1996, they imported [[Chevrolet C/K#C/K in Oceania|GMC C/Ks for ambulance conversions]]. Unlike the Suburbans, these vehicles were not available to the general public, nor did they bear Holden badging. They also were not built as right-hand-drives from the factory like the Suburban was; the same company that handled the ambulance conversion (Jacab Ambulance in [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]]) also switched the steering to the other side.

The GMT800-based Suburbans were introduced in late December 1999 (Texas-only) and January 2000 (nationally) for the 2000 model year.&lt;ref&gt;http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/gm-engineers-had-extra-year-work-2000-truck-line&lt;/ref&gt; They were sold in two series: [[Truck classification#Class 2|1/2-ton 1500]] and [[Truck classification#Class 2|3/4-ton 2500]]. Suburbans came in Base, LS and LT trims. Optional was pushbutton 4WD with low-range transfer case. A tow hitch with trailer wiring plug was optional.

For 2000, Chevrolet's long-serving [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L05|5.7&amp;nbsp;L]] and [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|7.4&amp;nbsp;L]] V8 engines were retired along with the 6.5&amp;nbsp;L diesel. New engines were [[LS based GM small-block engine#LM7|Vortec 5300]] {{convert|325|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} for the 1500 series and [[LS based GM small-block engine#LQ4|Vortec 6000]] {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} for the 2500 series.

New features included:
* A spare tire relocated beneath the vehicle (instead of in the cargo area as on previous models)
* "Puddle lamps" in the exterior mirrors on LS and LT models
* New instrument panel including a driver message center and engine hour meter
* Electronic climate control available on LT models
* Four-wheel disc brakes
* Load-leveling Autoride suspension available on LT models
* Premium Ride rear self-leveling suspension available on LS models
* Digital Components

For '''2001''', the 6.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 in 2500-series Suburbans gained {{convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from a number of changes including aluminum cylinder heads. The new [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L18|Vortec 8100]] {{convert|496|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V8 was added as an option for the 2500 as well. OnStar became standard on LT models and LS models with the new Z71 package. [[Quadrasteer]] four-wheel steering was added as an option on 2500 models only.

'''2002''' saw several optional features made standard equipment on the LS model, including front and rear air conditioning, alloy wheels, power windows, power front seats, side steps, fog lamps, and heated outside rear view mirrors. Base models were discontinued, leaving LS and LT.

The [[LS based GM small-block engine#L59|Vortec 5300 L59]] variant in the 1500 series added [[flex-fuel]] capability. The 6.0 engine was not available in the 1500 series.

For '''2003''', all GM full-size trucks received an upgraded interior, with better-quality materials and other enhancements. New radios offered [[Radio Data System]] compatibility, [[XM satellite radio]], [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound and improved ergonomics. Adjustable pedals were added as an option, and the instrument cluster-mounted Driver Information Center was improved and monitored up to 34 vehicle functions. A Panasonic DVD system was added as an option.
GM's [[Stabilitrak]] system was added, and [[Quadrasteer]] became available on 2500 series Suburbans. Towing capacity for [[Quadrasteer]]-equipped vehicles was reduced by 300&amp;nbsp;lbs (the weight of the system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denalitrucks.com/documents/Owner%20Manuals/2003_gmc_yukon_owners.pdf |title=2003 GMC Yukon Owner's Manual |website=General Motors Corporation |date=June 24, 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704011650/http://www.denalitrucks.com/documents/Owner%20Manuals/2003_gmc_yukon_owners.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For '''2004''', 1500-series Suburbans received the [[Hydroboost]] braking system that was previously introduced in the 2500 series.

The Mexican-market Suburban received a front end update this year, matching that of the Silverado.

The '''2005''' model year saw the long-standard side-hinged panel doors discontinued in favor of the formerly optional liftgate. All engines switched to an all-electric cooling system to reduce power loss and fuel consumption.

The Z71 package, long exclusive to 4WD models, became available on 2WD Suburbans. OnStar also became standard across the board.

Finally, Stabilitrak became standard on all models shortly after the start of the model year.

the 2005 Suburban 1500 won the [[J.D. Power|J.D. Power and Associates]] award for highest initial quality among large SUVs, beating out its rivals the [[Ford Expedition]] and [[Toyota Sequoia]].

For '''2006''', the GMT800 Suburban's last year, a special LTZ trim package became available, featuring {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels, all-wheel drive, and the LQ4 6.0&amp;nbsp;L engine of the 2500 series of trucks and SUVs.

The [[catalytic converter]]s were relocated closer to the engine. The XM radio antenna and the OnStar antenna were combined into a single unit.

The 2007 [[model year]] Suburban and Yukon XL were unveiled at the 2006 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January. Production of the redesigned [[GM GMT platform#GMT 900|GMT900]] Suburban and Yukon XL began at [[Janesville Assembly]] and [[Silao Assembly]] in January 2006 (Suburban) April 2006 (Yukon XL), with the vehicles arriving at dealerships in April.

The new models were redesigned with more modern, less boxy styling,&lt;ref name="The Car Design yearbook 5"/&gt; already seen on the previously released 2007 Tahoes and Yukons. The exterior features a more [[aerodynamic]] shape, made partly by a steeply raked windshield angle. The new design is more aerodynamic.

The interior has a redesigned dashboard and improved seats. It still retains its 9-passenger seating availability, which is available on LS and SLE models only. LT2, and LT3 models have leather seating and available 6-, 7-, and 8-passenger seating. A Z71 package was available on LT2 and LT3 models which includes two-tone leather seats. All Mexican-built Suburbans including the 9-seat models offer the special two-tone leather seating used by the Z71. The Suburban LTZ comes standard with a DVD player, GPS navigation enhanced radio that is touch screen.

For the 2010 model year, in which [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] ranked it as the number one affordable large SUV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Chevrolet_Suburban/ |title=2010 Chevrolet Suburban |website=US News &amp; World Report |date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Suburban added a premium interior package that includes tri-zone climate control and handy features like Bluetooth and rear audio controls. In addition, radios that are standard in all 2010 trims get a USB port, allowing for music to be played from auxiliary devices though the radio, as well as charging other small electronics. Side blind zone alert becomes an option on LT and LTZ. The 6.0 liter engine in the 2010 models will also be flex fuel capable. Minor front end changes including a slightly raised front bumper and side torso air bags were also made standard for 2010.

In February 2010, Chevrolet unveiled a 75th anniversary edition of the Suburban, which will have the LTZ trim with white diamond tricoat exterior paint and cashmere interior, along with standard 20-inch chrome-clad wheels, revised roof rails, integrated navigation radio, XM Satellite Radio, Bluetooth phone connectivity, rearview camera, rear park assist, remote starting, adjustable pedals, and leather upholstery with heated/cooled front seats. Chevrolet says that the anniversary edition will be limited to 2,570 units because of the amount of white diamond paint GM can procure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/02/10/chicago-2010-chevrolet-suburban-75th-anniversary-diamond-editio?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_autoblog |title=Chicago 2010: Chevrolet celebrates Suburban's 75th Anniversary with Diamond Edition |website=Autoblog |date=February 10, 2010 |author=Harley, Michael |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5.3&amp;nbsp;L and 6.0&amp;nbsp;L engines carried over, and a new {{convert|403|hp|kW|0}} 6.2&amp;nbsp;L Vortec V8 was added for the Yukon XL Denali.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The 8.1&amp;nbsp;L engine was dropped.

For the 2011 model year, the Suburban will add three new exterior colors to the lineup: Mocha Steel Metallic, Green Steel Metallic, and Ice Blue Metallic. The trims will also get an updated modification, with the rear audio system, Bluetooth, floor console/storage area, wood grain interior, luggage rack rails, body-color exterior door handle/mirror caps and premium-cloth front bucket seats now standard on the 1LS trim, and chrome recovery hooks, two-speed transfer case, and 20-inch chrome wheels standard on its 1LS 4WD models. In addition, the trailering package will feature the trailer brake controller as a standard on all trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conceptcarz.com/z18563/Chevrolet-Suburban.aspx |title=2011 Chervrolet Suburban: forging Ahead in Its 76th Year |publisher=Conceptcarz |date=July 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2012 model year, trailer sway control and Hill Start Assist become standard on all trims, while the LTZ trim added a heated steering wheel and Side Blind Zone Alert as a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://autos.aol.com/cars-Chevrolet-Suburban+1500-2012/overview/ |title=2012 Chevrolet Suburban Overview |publisher=AOL Autos |date=October 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the LT1/2 options for the Suburban and SLE1/2 and SLT1/2 options on the Yukon XL were discontinued, leaving the Suburban with only a LS, LT and LTZ trim and the Yukon XL with a SLE and SLT trim. In 2012, GMC celebrated its 100th anniversary by releasing a special edition of its Yukon XL, offering a Heritage Edition trim package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/30/gmc-debuts-2012-yukon-and-sierra-heritage-editions/ |title=GMC debuts 2012 Yukon and Sierra Heritage Editions |publisher=Autoblog |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also be the final year that three colors, Graystone Metallic, Gold Mist Metallic and Blue Topaz Metallic, would be offered, along with the all season blackwall P265/65R18 tires.

For the 2013 model year, two new colors were offered: Champagne Silver Metallic and Blue Ray Metallic (extra charge). Also new is Powertrain Grade Braking, normal mode. The 2013 arrived for Chevrolet dealers in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gmauthority.com/blog/2012/05/2013-chevy-suburban/ |title=Here Are The Changes to the 2013 Chevy Suburban: RPO Central |publisher=GM Authority |date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2014 model year, power-adjustable pedals, remote vehicle starter system and rear parking assist along with rear vision camera and inside mirror with camera display will become standard on the Suburban LS trims. In addition, Concord Metallic (which was supposed to be available for the 2013 MY) will be added to the Suburban color offerings for the 2014 models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/suburban/2014.html Chevrolet Suburban – 2014] from GM Media (released May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For the Yukon XL, a convenience package will now become standard on its SLE models, along with a new color, Deep Indigo Metallic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gmc.com/content/media/us/en/gmc/vehicles/yukon_xl_denali_xl/2014.html 2014 GMC Yukon / Yukon Denali &amp; Yukon XL / Yukon XL Denali] from GM Media (released May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, The Suburban came in second behind the Tahoe among the top-ranked large affordable SUVs by ''U.S News &amp; World Report.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/Affordable-Large-SUVs/ Large Affordable SUVs] from ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''&lt;/ref&gt; This would be followed by being acknowledged as an award recipient in the large SUV category by [[JD Power and Associates]] in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.jdpower.com/research/Chevrolet/Suburban%201500/2014/SUV/index.htm|title=2014 Chevrolet Suburban|first=|last=rayadmin|date=July 28, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-quarter ton model's towing capacity is {{convert|9600|lb|abbr=on}}, being one of the best of any 4x4 SUV and Unmatched by any other SUV. The three-quarter ton model also has a GCVW of {{convert|16000|lb|abbr=on}}.

The 2500 Suburban was originally sourced from Silao, Mexico from 2007 to 2008 but was moved to the Arlington, Texas assembly plant for the 2009 model year, where production of all GM fullsize SUVs was consolidated after the closing of the Janesville plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/news/news_detail.brand_gm.html/content/Pages/news/Plant_Facts/Other/Janesville |title=Janesville Assembly Fact Sheet (GM) |publisher=Media.gm.com |date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/content/Pages/news/us/en/2010/Oct/1001_gmsales/_jcr_content/rightpar/sectioncontainer/par/download/file.res/GM%20September%20Production%20by%20Plant.pdf |title=GM North America September 2010 Production by Plant |format=PDF |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM discontinued the 2500 3/4 Ton versions of both Suburban and Yukon XL models after the 2013 model year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/06/2014-chevy-suburban-gets-more-standard-equipment-rpo-central/ "2014 Chevy Suburban Gets More Standard Equipment: RPO Central"] from GM Authority (June 15, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/06/2014-gmc-yukon-yukon-xl-get-slight-updates-rpo-central/ "2014 GMC Yukon, Yukon XL Get Several Updates: RPO Central"] from GM Authority (June 15, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth generation Suburban's design provided the basis for the Declasse Granger and its law enforcement counterparts, a line of fictitious SUVs that are featured in the [[Grand Theft Auto|Grand Theft Auto video game series]] as of [[Grand Theft Auto V]].

The eleventh generation Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon XL, and Yukon Denali XL were introduced to the public on September 12, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/08/2015-chevy-tahoe-suburban-teased/ Chevy to reveal new Tahoe and Suburban on Thursday] from Autoblog (September 10, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and GM unveiled the vehicles in different locations (The Suburban in New York, Yukon XL in Los Angeles) on that date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/12/2015-chevy-tahoe-suburban-gmc-yukon-unveiled/ "2015 Chevy Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon unveiled"] from Autoblog (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Both vehicles are based on the GMT K2XX platform and will carry unique serial designated numbers, identified by platform (K2), brand (YC for Chevrolet, YG for GMC), drivetrain (C for 2WD; K for 4WD), tonnage (15 for half-ton, 25 for 3/4-ton, 35 for 1-ton), wheelbase (7 for short, 9 for long), and 06 for SUV, which means that a K2YC-K-15-9-06 would be identified as a Chevrolet Suburban 1500 4WD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucktrend.com/roadtests/suv/163_1309_2015_chevrolet_tahoe_suburban_gmc_yukon_first_look/ "2015 Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban GMC Yukon/XL/Denali First Look"] from Truck Trend (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The Suburban and Yukon XL went on sale in February 2014 as a 2015 model,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topspeed.com/cars/chevrolet/2015-chevrolet-suburban-ar160482.html 2015 Chevrolet Suburban] from Top Speed (September 26, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/latest-reviews/2015-gmc-yukon-head-start-better-fuel-economy-smoother-ride-article-1.1482902 2015 GMC Yukon gets a head-start on the new year with better fuel economy, smoother ride] from New York Daily News (October 11, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; with the vehicles built exclusively in Arlington, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130513/OEM04/305139954/gm-delayed-suv-rollouts-to-focus-on-pickups "GM delayed SUV rollouts to focus on pickups"] from Automotive News (May 13, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production details===
The newly redesigned Suburban and Yukon XL were showcased to the public for the first time on September 27, 2013, at the [[State Fair of Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/07/gm-unveil-new-suvs-state-fair-of-texas/ GM To Unveil New SUVs at The State Fair of Texas?] from Autoblog (August 7, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2013/10/2015-chevrolet-suburban-more-photos.html 2015 Chevrolet Suburban: More Photos] from Kicking Tires/Cars.com (October 2, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This move comes on the heels of the 80th anniversary of the first production of the Suburban in 1934.

The designs and concepts were created by GM's exterior design manager Chip Thole (prior to his transfer to GM's [[Buick]] design studio in 2013), who told ''Truck Trend'' "I start with what intuition tells me about the market and get the team going on that. You look at trends around the industry – fashion, culture, what people are buying, what they say they want now – and project that into the future. The fun part is putting those ideas to paper and going from there." He then added "We wanted to take what was good about today's vehicles, bring that forward and make them new and different with that spark of freshness that people recognize, without making them gimmicky or overdone." Thole also challenged his design team to help bring ideas to the SUVs, which lead to the split [[headlamp]]s and a more graphic feel for the Suburban design, while a more industrial but sculptured look was added to the Yukon XL to give it a unique identity of its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucktrend.com/features/consumer/163_1406_interview_chip_thole_former_exterior_design_manager_gm_full_size_suvs/ "Interview: Chip Thole, (Former) Exterior Design Manager, GM Full-Size SUVs"] from ''Truck Trend'' (February 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Production on the Suburban and Tahoe began in December 2013 with the first completed SUVs being used for testing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/business/autos-latest-news/20131202-gm-arlington-plant-prepares-for-big-suv-launch.ece "GM Arlington Plant Prepares For Big SUV Launch"] from [[Dallas Morning News]] (December 2, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; GM then officially started shipping the vehicles to dealerships on February 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2014/02/general-motors-arlington-plant-begins-shipping-2015-full-size-suvs.html/ "General Motors Arlington plant begins shipping 2015 full-size SUVs"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807133601/http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2014/02/general-motors-arlington-plant-begins-shipping-2015-full-size-suvs.html/ |date=August 7, 2016 }} from ''Dallas Morning News'' (February 7, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that it takes 8–10 weeks to assemble the SUVs, save for the upgrades on the level trims and destination scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donlen.com/production-trucks-gm.aspx "GM Trucks (Production Updates)"] from Donlen.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrolet introduced the designs, choices and build-your-own features for the 2015 models on its website in January 2014 with a set price starting at $47,000 (2WD) to $50,000 (4WD) for the LS trim, $52,000 (2WD) to $55,000 (4WD) for the LT trim, and $61,000 (2WD) to $65,000 (4WD) for the LTZ trim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20131217/OEM04/131219877/chevy-hikes-15-suburban-tahoe-prices-1000-3000# Chevy hikes ’15 Suburban, Tahoe prices $1,000–$3,000] from Automotive News (December 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.caranddriver.com/burban-straight-up-2015-chevy-suburban-priced-from-48295/ "’Burban Straight Up: 2015 Chevy Suburban Priced from $48,295"] from ''Car &amp; Driver'' (February 7, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1403-2015-chevrolet-tahoe-suburban-pricing/ "2015 Suburban Tahoe and Suburban Priced"] from Automobile Magazine (March 5, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The pricing on GMC's Yukon XL's are set at around $49,000 (2WD) to $52,000 (4WD) for the SLE, $57,000 (2WD) to $60,000 (4WD) for the SLT, and $65,000 (2WD) to $68,000 (4WD) for the Denali trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cars.com/gmc/yukon-xl/2015/snapshot 2015 GMC Yukon XL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221181414/http://www.cars.com/gmc/yukon-xl/2015/snapshot |date=February 21, 2014 }} from Cars.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
The front fascias of the Chevy Suburban and GMC Yukon XL are distinct, but from the base of the A-pillars back, they share most of the same styling cues. This now includes inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics, fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight, and the wiper blades that were located on the liftgate door were moved to the rear spoiler located on the top of the rear liftgate window. Also noticeable is the SUV's length, which expands from {{convert|222.4|to|224.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (the Yukon XL's length is shorter at {{convert|224.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) and its width from {{convert|79.1|to|80.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, while the height decreases from {{convert|76.8|to|74.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, thus allowing the vehicle to become slightly leaner, a little bit wider, more streamlined, and roomier.

A more-efficient, direct-injected EcoTec3 V8 powertrain (5.3 for the Suburban, 6.2 for Yukon XL/Yukon Denali XL) coupled with improved aerodynamics, helped the SUVs offer greater estimated highway fuel economy and improving its fuel economy estimates to 16MPG (City)/23MPG (Highway)/18 (Combined) for 2WD, and 15MPG (City)/22MPG (Highway)/18 (Combined) for 4WD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2015_Chevrolet_Suburban.shtml 2015 Chevrolet Suburban] from http://www.fueleconomy.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The increased fuel economy also vaulted the Suburban/Yukon XL into the top spot among large SUVs with the most efficient fuel economy rating numbers for this segment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1402-2015-chevrolet-suburban-tahoe-gmc-yukon-epa-rated/ "2015 Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon EPA Rated"] from ''Automobile Magazine'' (February 24, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, when ''Motor Trend'' (which placed the 2015 Suburban on the front cover of its June 2014 issue) did a road test review on the SUVs, it estimated the 4WD MPG on the Suburban LTZ to be slightly better at around 15.2 City and 22.3 Highway, while the 4WD Yukon Denali XL, whose fuel economy (MPG) is rated at 14 City/20 Highway, was estimated lower at 12.4 City and 19.2 Highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/1404_2015_chevrolet_suburban_gmc_yukon_xl_first_test/ "First Test: 2015 Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon Denali XL"] from ''[[Motor Trend]]'' (April 3, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the 2007–14 version, both the Suburban and Yukon XL do not share a single piece of sheetmetal or lighting element with the brands' full-size pick-up trucks (GMC Sierra and Chevy Silverado), and the front grilles of both vehicles are slightly altered to give it their own identity. The front headlights features projector-beam headlamps that flanks the Chevrolet-signature dual-port grille – chrome on all models, sweeping into the front fenders, while Tahoe and Suburban LTZ and Yukon and Yukon XL Denali trims feature projector beam high-intensity discharge headlamps and light-emitting diode daytime running lamps. The Yukon and Yukon XL also feature projector-beam halogen headlamps on all SLE and SLT trims. The improved safety features included a 360-degree radar detection for crash avoidance and occupant protection and a high-tech anti-theft system that now includes vertical and interior sensors, in-glass and window breaking, a triggering alarm and a shutdown device that prevents the vehicle from moving. The latter is expected to address the issues regarding the constant thefts of the vehicles, especially with the previous generation's removable seats and items left in the cargo space, which has become a target for carjackers who see the third row seats as valuable on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/12/24/chevy-tahoe-suburban-gmc-yukon-theft-tech/ "GM looks to combat high theft rates on SUVs with added tech"] from Autoblog (December 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; According to General Motors' head of Global Vehicle Security Bill Biondo, "We have engineered a layered approach to vehicle security," adding that "With new standard features and the available theft protection package, we are making the vehicles less attractive target to thieves and more secure for our customers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/12/a-look-at-the-multitude-of-anti-theft-feature-for-the-2015-tahoe-and-suburban-video/ "A Look At The Multitude Of Anti-Theft Features For The 2015 Tahoe And Suburban: Video"] from GM Authority (December 20, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also new are the addition of fold-flat second and third-row seats (replacing the aforementioned removable third seats), which is now a standard feature but can be equipped with an optional power-folding feature for the upgraded trims, and an additional two inches of leg room for second-row passengers. HD radio became a standard feature on all trims. Multiple USB ports and power outlets are now spread throughout their interiors, including one 110-volt, three-prong outlet on both Suburban and Yukon XL, with the Suburban adding an available eight-inch color touch screen radio with next-generation MyLink connectivity along with an available rear-seat entertainment system with dual screens and Blu-ray DVD player, while the Yukon XL adds a standard eight-inch-diagonal color touch screen radio with enhanced IntelliLink and available navigation. A 4G LTE WiFi access system, along with Siri Eyes Free and text messaging alerts, was included into all vehicles that feature the OnStar device around the second quarter of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1090610_2015-chevy-tahoe-gmc-yukon-denali-chevrolet-suburban-first-drives "2015 Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon Denali, Chevrolet Suburban: First Drives"] from The Car Connection (February 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/suburban/2015.html 2015 Chevrolet Suburban] from GM Media (released August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yukon XL interior has more additional features that includes seats stuffed with dual-firmness foam, a standard Bose sound system and SD card slots, and laminated glass for the windshield and front windows, decreasing interior noise. The Denali Yukon XLs comes equipped with active noise-cancellation technology, with GM's third-generation magnetic ride control suspension as a standard feature, which is only featured on the Suburban LTZ models, whose upgraded features also includes a real-time damping system that delivers more precise body motion control by "reading" the road every millisecond, and changing damping in just five milliseconds.

The Suburban will have eight color palettes to choose from for the 2015 model year: Champagne Silver Metallic, Silver Ice Metallic, White Diamond Tricoat, Sable Metallic, Crystal Red Tricoat, Summit White, Tungsten Metallic, and Black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/12/check-out-the-2015-chevrolet-tahoe-and-suburban-colors/ "These Are The Eight Colors Of The 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe And Suburban"] from GM Authority (December 16, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The GMC Yukon XL palettes will be available in nine colors: Onyx Black, Summit White, Quicksilver Metallic, Champagne Silver Metallic, Iridium Metallic, Bronze Alloy Metallic, Crystal Red Tintcoat, White Diamond Tricoat, and Midnight Amethyst Metallic. The latter three will be the most expensive color trim options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/12/the-nine-colors-of-the-2015-gmc-yukon-and-yukon-denali/ "The Nine Colors Of The 2015 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL"] from GM Authority (December 19, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015 mid-year update====
The Suburban received a new color palette, Brownstone Metallic, and added a hands-free power liftgate feature that is standard on LTZ, but included on LT with the optional Luxury Package. The added 4G LTE WiFi and Siri features became standard on both LT and LTZ trims, while the MyLink with Navigation feature was upgraded from optional to standard on the LTZ trim. The E85 capability feature is removed from retail orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/10/model-year-2015i-chevy-tahoe-suburban-get-a-bevy-of-technology-equipment-updates/ "Model Year 2015i Chevy Tahoe, Suburban Get A Bevy Of Technology &amp; Equipment Updates"] from GM Authority (October 24, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yukon XL, in addition to receiving the aforementioned features, sees the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine being updated with the new 8L90E eight-speed automatic transmission for the interim model year, allowing it to improve fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/11/gmc-gets-official-with-2015i-technology-equipment-updates-for-yukon-denali-and-denali-xl/ "GMC Gets Official With 2015i Technology &amp; Equipment Updates For Yukon Denali And Denali XL"] from GM Authority (November 6, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The Yukon XL Denali however saw its MSRP bumped up by $1,300 in part due to the loaded features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/11/2015i-gmc-yukon-denali-family-with-8-speed-sees-minor-msrp-bump/ "2015i GMC Yukon Denali Family With 8 Speed Sees Minor MSRP Bump"] from GM Authority (November 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

All GM Full-sized SUVs received a body colored painted Shark Fin antenna as part of the 2015 mid-year refresh.

===2016===
For the 2016 model year (which commenced sales in July 2015), the Chevrolet Suburban received more upgraded changes and new features that included power-adjustable pedals, forward collision alert, IntelliBeam headlamps, lane keep assist and a safety alert seat as part of the newly introduced enhanced driver alert package as an available option on the LS trim. The inside floor console with storage area-SD card reader was removed, while a new AM/FM audio integrated system with Sirius XM, HD Radio, and CD/MP3 capabilities was introduced as a standard feature on all trims; the 8-inch MyLink feature was expanded to the LS trim and became standard (replacing the 4-inch display), although the navigation feature remains as an option on LT and standard on LTZ. A new liftgate shield was added to the Theft Protection Package, along with the new lane keep assist which replaced the lane departure warning. The capless fuel fill tanks became standard on all trims. Siren Red Tintcoat and Iridescent Pearl Tricoat became the new color trims, replacing Crystal Red Tintcoat and White Diamond Tricoat. The instrument cluster was re-configured with a new multi-color enhancement and a heads-up display was introduced as a standard only on the LTZ trim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/suburban/2016.html "2016 Chevrolet Suburban"] from GM Media (June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/05/2016-chevy-suburban-gets-new-colors-technology-and-more/ "2016 Chevy Suburban Gets New Colors, Technology And More"] from GM Authority (May 19, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 models also saw a price hike as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/09/chevrolet-suburban-sees-700-msrp-hike-for-2016-model-year/ "Chevrolet Suburban Sees $700 MSRP Hike For 2016 Model Year"] from GM Authority (September 1, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 GMC Yukon XL also sees similar changes, with the new enhanced driver alert package as an available option on the SLE trim, liftgate, power, hands-free now packaged on SLT trims, a free-flow feature that replaced the Premium package, a lane keep assist added to all trims, and two new premium colors (Crimson Red Tintcoat and White Frost Tricoat) replacing Crystal Red Tintcoat and White Diamond Tricoat respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/vehicles/yukon_xl_denali_xl/2016.html "2016 GMC Yukon XL"] from GM Media (June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/05/2015-gmc-yukon-yukon-xl-get-new-colors-technology-and-more/ "2016 GMC Yukon &amp; Yukon XL Gets New Colors, Technology, and More"] from GM Authority (May 13, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chevrolet added [[CarPlay|Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] Capability features to the Suburban starting with the 2016 models. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927225/apple-carplays-coming-to-these-14-chevrolet-cars-in-the-2016-model-year.html "Apple CarPlay's coming to these 14 Chevrolet cars in the 2016 model year"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; while the Android Auto option will only be available on LT and LTZ trims featuring 8-inch screens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927293/these-are-the-14-chevrolet-cars-from-the-2016-model-year-that-will-have-android-auto.html "These are the 14 Chevrolet cars from the 2016 model year that will have Android Auto"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

GM expanded newer 4G LTE features (like detecting battery failure and monitoring insurance discounts based on driver performance) to 2016 model year vehicles, including the Suburban, which GM cited as being the vehicle that is the most used among data subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2015/06/18/gms-connection-boost-consumer-features-revenue/28964127/ "GM’s 4G connection to boost consumer features, revenue"] from [[Detroit News]] (June 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===
The 2017 model year Chevrolet Suburban received upgraded changes after it went on sale in August 2016. The level trims LS and LT are retained but the LTZ is renamed Premier, the latter serving as the equivalent to the Yukon XL Denali. The LS trims also saw the badged "LS" lettering removed. The new features includes two new colors (Blue Velvet Metallic and Pepperdust Metallic), two new 22-inch wheel options (a 7-spoke Silver wheels with Chrome inserts for all trims; Ultra Bright machined aluminum wheels with Bright Silver finish for Premier trim only), black roof rack cross rails (as part of the Texas Edition Package and All-Season Package), front active aero shutters (all trims), and heated and vented seats (Premier trim only). The MyLink was updated to incorporate Teen Driver, App Shop, Rear Seat Reminder customization, and Low Speed Forward Automatic Braking (as part of Enhanced Driver Alert Package on the LS trim, but standard on LT and Premier). The Rear Seat Entertainment System was overhauled to include a new video voiceover feature for the visually and hearing impaired, a HDMI/MHL connector, digital headphones, Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) technology incorporated into the Wi-Fi system, and a 2nd USB port with capability of charging up to a 2.1-amp at the back of the console.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/08/2017-chevrolet-suburban-updates-changes-new-features-announced/ "2017 Chevy Suburban Gets New Colors, Wheels &amp; Technology; Active Aero Shutters, Premier Trim &amp; More"] from GM Authority (August 4, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2017-Chevrolet-Suburban-order-guide-revised-July-29-2016.pdf 2017 Chevrolet Suburban Order Guide] (from Chevrolet, posted July 29, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 model year Yukon XL also received similar changes, but with a few exceptions. Two new colors, ''Dark Blue Sapphire Metallic'' and ''Mineral Metallic'' were introduced, the latter exclusive to the Denali, which ialso added a new 22-inch ultra bright aluminum wheels with midnight silver premium paint and a [[head-up display]] to its features. The interior backlights changed from red to blue. The heated and vented driver and front passenger seats are now standard on the SLT and Denali trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/08/2017-gmc-yukon-changes-updates-new-colors-new-wheels-front-active-aero-shutters-revamped-rear-seat-entertainment/ |title=2017 GMC Yukon And Yukon XL Get New Colors, Wheels, Front Active Aero Shutters, Revamped Rear Seat Entertainment And More |website=GM Authority |date=August 8, 2016 |access-date=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2017-GMC-Yukon-XL-Order-Guide-Revised-August-5-2016.pdf |title=2017 GMC Yukon XL / Denali order guide |website=GM Authority |date=August 5, 2016 |access-date=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 ===
The 2018 model year Suburban had a few upgrades and deletions. The LED daytime running lights became standard on all trims, along with a new color, havana brown and satin steel metallic. The cocoa/mahogany interior that was combined with the pepperdust metallic exterior was dropped along with the wireless/inductive phone charging that was part of the Luxury and Texas Edition LT level trims. The fleet/commercial level trim, which had fewer features, is upgraded to include MyLink, HD Radio, multi-color driver information center, LED daytime running lights, and an optional driver alert package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/06/new-2018-chevrolet-suburban-gets-new-color-standard-led-daytime-running-lamps-rst-package-and-more/ "2018 Chevrolet Suburban Gets New Color, Standard LED Daytime Running Lamps, RST Package, &amp; More"] from GM Authority (June 23, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Yukon Denali XL received a new grille with a layered appearance like the ones on its redesigned 2018 Acadia and Terrain brands, featuring high-intensity-discharge headlights and LED daytime running lights. The refreshed design provides better airflow to the radiator, and when less cooling air is needed, shutters behind the grille close to improve aerodynamics and increase efficiency. The interior featured new ash wood trim that GMC says gives the cabin a richer appearance. A new 10-speed automatic transmission was mated to its 420-horsepower, 6.2-liter V-8 engine, replacing the 8-speed transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cars.com/articles/2018-gmc-yukon-denali-preview-1420695507159/ "2018 GMC Yukon Denali Preview"] from Cars.com (May 24, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2019 ===
The 2019 Suburban will have both Havana Metallic and Tungsten Metallic deleted in favor of a new Shadow Gray Metallic exterior color, while the top of the line Premier will now have the name displayed on the tailgate. The LS trim continues to make HD Radio a standard feature, but can be deleted if customers opt for the OnStar feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/05/heres-whats-new-for-the-2019-chevy-suburban/ “Here’s What’s New For The 2019 Chevy Suburban”] from GM Authority (May 20, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 model year GMC Yukon XL adds three new exterior colors, Dark Sky Metallic, Pepperdust Metallic, and Smokey Quartz Metallic, while deleting two others, Mineral Metallic and Iridium Metallic. GMC also introduces two new package features, Graphite Edition and Graphite Performance Edition, which will be available in the SLT level trim only&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/05/what-is-new-for-the-2019-gmc-yukon-and-2019-yukon-denali/ “Here’s What Is New For The 2019 GMC Yukon and 2019 Yukon Denali”] from GM Authority (May 25, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2020 ===

The 2020 Chevrolet Suburban will not have the LT Signature Package and the LS All-Season Package, along with the Pepperdust Metallic color,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/06/2020-chevrolet-suburban-heres-whats-new-and-different/ "2020 Chevrolet Suburban: Here’s What’s New And Different"] from GM Authority (June 21, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; while the 2020 GMC Yukon XL replaced its Pepperdust Metallic color with Carbon Black Metallic and made no additional changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/07/2020-gmc-yukon-heres-whats-new-and-different/ "2020 GMC Yukon: Here’s What’s New And Different"] from GM Authority (July 3, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2019, Chevrolet introduced a twelfth generation Suburban at [[Little Caesars Arena]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. This time around, GM chose to introduce the Chevrolet full size SUVs first. The GMC Yukon XL was later introduced on January 14, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30517344/2021-gmc-yukon-xl-photos-info/|title=New 2021 GMC Yukon, Yukon XL Get AT4 Off-Road Trim and Diesel Engine|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Beresford|first=Colin|date=14 January 2020|accessdate=14 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the full size fifth generation Cadillac Escalade made its debut on February 4, 2020,&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/next-gen-2021-cadillac-escalade-will-drop-in-february/ "Next-Gen 2021 Cadillac Escalade Will Drop In February"] from GM Authority (December 12, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; its extended length sibling Escalade ESV will be the last GM full size SUV to be introduced, which will take place at an alternative location in mid-spring 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic that pushed the [[New York International Auto Show]] to August 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2020/02/04/2021-cadillac-escalade-esv-debut-new-york-auto-show/#slide-endcap “2021 Cadillac Escalade ESV will debut at the New York Auto Show”] from Autoblog (February 4, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/02/2021-cadillac-escalade-esv-spotted-on-the-street/ “2021 Cadillac Escalade ESV Spotted On The Street”] from GM Authority (February 12, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt; Production could be pushed back from a late April start due to the growing pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-autos-launches/coronavirus-could-force-gm-to-delay-its-redesigned-2021-suvs-idUSKBN21H3D8 “Coronavirus could force GM to delay its redesigned 2021 SUVs”] from Reuters (March 30, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2021-present Suburban===
Based on the same [[GMT T1XX]] platform as the Silverado 1500, the Suburban distinguished itself by swapping that truck's live axle and leaf springs for an independent rear multilink suspension setup with coil springs, thus lowering the floor of the vehicle and creates more room in both the cargo area and the second- and third-row seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/irs-for-2021-chevrolet-tahoe-suburban-was-the-plan-from-the-beginning/ ""IRS For 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban, Was The Plan From The Beginning"] from GM Authority (December 11, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; The Suburban expanded its size length to 225.7 inches, and the wheelbase to 134.1 inches while shorted down by 15 inches longer due to the rear wheelbase moving back by 5 inches, making it the largest and longest SUV in the extended length segment. It gains 2.0 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row and 2.2 inches of third-row legroom. 

The trims will continue to feature the primary basic LS, LT and Premier levels, with the 4WD-exclusive Z71 and RST moving from package to premium levels, along with the newly added High Country level, the latter being the top of the line.&lt;ref&gt;[https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban “2021 Chevrolet Suburban”] from CarBuzz (March 16, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Quad exhaust tailpipes are added to the vehicle, giving it a more unique look, although this feature will only be standard on Premier and High Country only. This feature will not be offered on the LS, LT, Z71 and RST because of their configuration as a regular base, off-road, and street-centric level trims respectively, nor on all trims with a Duramax option.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/01/breaking-down-the-exhaust-treatments-for-the-2021-chevrolet-tahoe-suburban/ “ Breaking Down The Exhaust Treatments For The 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban”] from GM Authority (January 27, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it retained a boxy look, it added a more curvy design with this change and adopted the same Chevrolet design language featuring the front grille and LED sinister-like lighting that is also used on the Silverado, save for the black-grilled Z71 (without the bumper) and RST. The tailgate is more front and center, with the signature "Suburban" name stretched across it. A combination of sheet metal and aluminum was used to ensure a more lightweight vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/2021-chevrolet-suburban-and-tahoe-use-aluminum-panels-to-reduce-weight/ “2021 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe Use Aluminum Panels to Reduce Weight”] from GM Authority (December 12, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The dashboard and entertainment system have been fleshed out, moving away from the traditional design. Newly updated features include a 10.25-inch touch screen that is now standard on all trims, and a pair of 12.6-inch LCD rear screens that can play movies and offer content from passengers’ smartphones, and can play different programs on the two screens. A new push button shifter column (P, R, N, D) is placed on the dashboard, nine camera displays for enhanced towing capabilities and a total of 30 additional safety features have been implemented throughout the Suburban. An Air Ride Adaptive Suspension is standard on the higher trims, likewise with a 8-inch driver screen. Another new feature, a power sliding console, will become available later in late Summer or Fall 2020. The High Country Suburban will also have a Deluxe package option with advance features that will be exclusive to this trim only.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/02/2021-chevrolet-tahoe-suburban-high-country-deluxe-package-feature-spotlight/ “2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban High Country Deluxe Package: Feature Spotlight”] from GM Authority (February 6, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suburban will also feature a Duramax diesel engine as an option (available on all trims and packages except for the Z71&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/why-the-2021-chevrolet-tahoe-suburban-z71-dont-offer-3-0l-duramax-diesel/ “Why The 2021 Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe Z71 Don’t Offer 3.0L Duramax Diesel”] from GM Authority (December 31, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;) for the first time, and so far the only brand outside its competitors to have this option; a 3.0L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] is used which produces 277 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. GM has no plans to offer this model in a 2500 or 3500 series version. Pending any changes that could result in a delay due to the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic that has slowed down production, the Twelfth generation Suburban is expected to arrive at dealerships in late 2020 as a 2021 model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30173547/2021-chevy-suburban-tahoe-photos-info/ "All-New 2021 Chevy Suburban and Tahoe Get Roomier, Add a Diesel"] from Car and Driver (December 10, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.consumerreports.org/suvs/2021-chevrolet-tahoe-suburban-preview/ "2021 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban Grow in Size and Features"] from Consumer Reports (December 10, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are plans to make it available in Left-hand drive regions, GM has been making plans to bring the Suburban to right-hand drive countries. Australia and New Zealand are among the key countries expected to be included but temporarily held off on the plans,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motoring.com.au/hsv-readying-chevrolet-silverado-1500-and-suburban-122250 “HSV readying Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and Suburban”] from Motoring (December 19, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;citing [[Holden]]’s brief and unsuccessful tenure to market the Suburban from 1998 to 2001, and GM’s decision to retire the Holden name in 2021.

===2021-present Yukon XL===
GMC unveiled its twelfth generation Yukon XL in [[Vail, Colorado]] on January 14, 2020, alongside its full size sibling Yukon. Like the Suburban, the Yukon XL will also feature an independent rear suspension, a 3.0-liter inline-six turbodiesel engine, and a top-shelf suspension option featuring air springs and magnetic-ride shocks, a standard 5.3-liter V-8, an optional 420-hp 6.2-liter V-8, and a 10-speed automatic transmission that is standard across the lineup. It also gains 4.1 inches in the wheelbase but only 0.9 inch in overall length, making it still short of the Suburban's length. The dashboard will have two versions, one similar to the Suburban while a different one with a larger entertainment screen will be exclusive to the Denali. The Yukon XL's design follows GMC's design language, with the front grille mimicking the Sierra but the tailgate mimicking the GMC crossover SUV lineup with the lights extended to the tailgate doors. 

The lineup of level trims also expanded as well, with the SLE, SLT, and Denali now joined by the 4WD-exclusive AT4, the latter of which comes standard with the Magnetic Ride Control electronically adaptive dampers, AT4-exclusive leather-appointed seats and stitching with a unique Jet Black interior color and Brandy accents, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row outboard seats, a two-speed transfer case, 20-inch [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] all-terrain tires, Traction Select System with off-road mode, hill descent control, and skid plates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://carbuzz.com/cars/gmc/yukon-xl “2021 GMC Yukon XL”] from CarBuzz (March 17, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Twelfth generation Yukon XL was scheduled to arrive in dealers in Summer 2020 as a 2021 model, but due to the pandemic is being delayed until further notice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/yukon/2021/2021-gmc-yukon-yukon-xl-first-look-review/ "2021 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL First Look: Breaking Away from Chevy?"] from Motor Trend (January 14, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/14/2021-gmc-yukon-reveal/#slide-endcap "Redesigned 2021 GMC Yukon gets a diesel, AT4 model, Denali-exclusive interior"] from Autoblog (January 14, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt; The Yukon XL will also be offered for the first time ever in Mexico (GMC had only offered the Yukon in that country due to GM not wanting to have the Yukon XL cannibalized in terms of sales with the Suburban, which is also that country’s best selling SUV), where it will only be available in the Denali trim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/03/gm-announces-all-new-2021-gmc-yukon-for-mexico/ “GM Announces All-New 2021 GMC Yukon For Mexico”] from GM Authority (March 31, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signature Editions==
Beginning with the 2018 model year, Chevrolet offered a “Signature Edition” package/trims of the Suburban. Each of the specialty versions were available at the LT and Premier level trims. Both the Z71 and RST became the fourth and fifth level trims starting with the twelfth generation Suburban for the 2021 model year, while the remaining continues as package features.

===Z71 and Texas Edition===
On September 26, 2014, Chevrolet debuted the updated Z71 Suburban at the State Fair of Texas, along with the debut of the Texas Edition Suburban, the latter due to Texas having the most units of Suburbans sold in the United States (As of August 2014, sales of the Chevrolet SUVs in Texas were up 37 percent) and to celebrate the 60th anniversary of GM's Arlington Assembly plant; production of the Z71 Suburban began in October 2014.

As with the previous Z71 Suburbans, this version continued to be offered in a 4WD LT trim only, featuring a front skid plate, off-road tires mounted on 18-inch wheels, a unique grille, running boards and "Z71" identification inside and out. Fog lamps, front tow hooks and front parking assist are also included. The 2016 Z71 package was modified again, as portions of the Z71 items added on the Texas Edition package as an optional feature by request from customers was discontinued, making it a stand-alone package. The Z71 package was upgraded to a level trim starting with the twelfth generation models.

The Texas Edition Suburban, which became part of the Texas Edition lineup along with the Tahoe and Silverado, was available in both LT and LTZ trims for the 2015 model year, featuring a maximum trailering package, twenty-inch polished aluminum wheels (on LT models), twenty-two-inch premium painted aluminum wheels (on LTZ models), and an exclusive "Texas Edition" badge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/09/26/chevy-tahoe-suburban-z71-texas-edition-official/ "Chevy announces Tahoe and Suburban Z71, Texas Editions"] from Autoblog (September 26, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2016 model year, Chevrolet discontinued the LTZ package but modified for the LT package without the requested Z71 features. The Twelfth generation Suburban will continue to offer the Texas Edition for the LT and Premier trims only when combined with the Luxury, LT Signature, and Premium packages.

====LT Signature Edition====
The Suburban LT Signature Edition, introduced in the 2018 model year, was an optional package trim, similar to the luxury package but with less expensive features, available in the LT level trim only. This option was discontinued after the 2019 model year, but will be offered for the 2021 model year.

====Midnight Edition====
A Midnight Edition Suburban, an all-black optional package available in 4WD LT and Z71 versions, was introduced for the 2017 model year. This version became part of the Signature Edition Suburban feature for the 2018 model year up until the 2020 model year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.caranddriver.com/tangled-up-in-black-chevy-launches-midnight-edition-tahoe-and-suburban/ "Tangled Up In Black: Chevy Launches Midnight Edition Tahoe And Suburban"] from ''[[Car and Driver]]'' (September 12, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Premier Plus====
On August 13, 2018, Chevrolet introduced a more upgraded version of the top of the line Premier level trim of the Suburban, packaged as the Premier Plus, featuring a 6.2L engine, the classic gold bowtie emblems, chrome nameplate badging, and new polished 22-inch wheels. The interior is unique to these models, boasting with heated/ventilated Black-and-Mahogany leather front seats, Jet Black trim surround, a head-up display, and an eight-inch cluster. The exterior features standard cross rails, chrome power steps, and chrome exhaust tips. This feature was discontinued with the 2020 model year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/08/new-special-edition-chevrolet-tahoe-suburban-models-powered-by-6-2l-v8/ "New 6.2L Chevy Tahoe, Suburban Models Drop"] from GM Authority (August 13, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

====RST Edition====
Chevrolet added a new package to the 2018 model year Suburban with the introduction of the street-themed RST (Rally Sport Truck) Special Edition Suburban. Originally at the time of the announcement, it was supposed to be available as an option for the LT and Premier trims as a Performance Package that included a 420-hp, 6.2L V-8 engine, a Magnetic Ride Control with performance calibration, and an all-new Hydra-Matic 10L80 10-speed automatic transmission. The press release also detailed additional features; The chrome elements are absent as body-color grilles surround the door and handles, along with an added gloss-black grille and mirror caps, black roof rails, window trim, badging and Chevy bowties, an exclusive 22-inch wheels wrapped in Bridgestone P285/45R 22 tires, a Borla performance exhaust system, massive front red Brembo six-piston, fixed aluminum calipers with brake pads clamping on larger-than-stock {{convert|410|x|32|mm|in|abbr=on}} Duralife rotors, coupled with an 84 percent increase in brake pad area and a 42 percent increase in rotor area to increase system thermal capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gm.com/mol/m-2017-apr-nyas-chevrolet-0406-rst.html "RST Special Edition Brings Street Look and Power to the New Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban"] official press release from GM (April 6, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the press release Chevrolet confirmed that the RST Suburban would only be available as an appearance package, as the 6.2L engine would not be used for the 2018 model year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/04/2018-chevy-suburban-will-not-offer-optional-performance-package/ "2018 Chevrolet Suburban Will Not Offer Optional Performance Package"] from GM Authority (April 10, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; But on May 4, 2018, Chevrolet expanded the RST package to the Suburban as an option for the 2019 model year that will now include the 10-speed automatic transmission and 6.2L engine, reversing a decision made by GM that it would be exclusive to GMC and Cadillac's Suburban siblings Yukon XL and Escalade ESV. The packaged trim went on sale in July 2018. The RST package option became a level trim with the twelfth generation Suburban for the 2021 model year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2018/05/04/chevy-suburban-rst-performance-package-v8/ “2019 Chevy Suburban RST Performance Package finally adds the big engine”] from Autoblog (May 4, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==2500HD and 3500HD Suburban==

A 2500HD Suburban became available in 2015 as a 2016 model. However, this version, identified as a Class 3 vehicle (around 10,000 to 14,000 pound GVWR), is only available for sale to rental companies and commercial fleet entities as a 4WD vehicle and will use the same design as the eleventh generation version, but uses a different engine altogether. The 2500HD Suburban is only offered in LS and LT trims, reserving the LTZ trim for a more luxurious offering (like limousine or taxi-related services). There is no 2WD or upgraded packages. In addition, there are no plans to offer a 3/4-ton GMC Yukon XL as GM is making the design exclusive to Chevrolet for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheersandgears.com/_/chevrolet-truck-news/2016-chevrolet-suburban-hd-will-be-34-ton-fleet-only-r2707 "2016 Chevrolet Suburban HD will be 3/4-Ton; Fleet Only"] from Cheers &amp; Gears (March 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/03/2016-chevrolet-suburban-hd-to-be-offered-exclusively-for-fleets/ "2016 Chevrolet Suburban HD To Be Offered Exclusively For Fleets"] From GM Authority (March 18, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

A one-ton "Suburban 3500HD," which would be a GM-unique SUV, was introduced for the 2016 model year. This is government-exclusive and available in 4WD LS and LT trims only, weighing around 11,000 pound GVWR, 17-inch machined aluminum wheels (8 lug), a high capacity air cleaner, 220 amp alternator, external engine oil cooler and auxiliary transmission cooler. Although the vehicle has a high GVWR, it is configured to provide a minimal towing capacity and is primarily intended for conversion to an armored vehicle. This version does not include HD radio, nor is there a GMC Yukon XL equivalent, making this version exclusive to Chevrolet as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/06/2016-chevrolet-suburban-3500hd-will-be-powered-by-6-0l-vortec-v8-and-have-these-options/ "2016 Chevrolet Suburban HD Will be Powered By 6.0L Vortec V8 and Have These Options"] from GM Authority (June 23, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2020 model year would be the last year for these two features, as GM has decided not to carry them over to the twelfth generation models for the time being.

==Additional changes==
===Upgrades===
There was no diesel variant of the full-size SUVs for the 2015-2020 model year versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/09/2015-chevrolet-tahoe-and-suburban-live-web-chat-the-recap/ 2015 Chevy Suburban &amp; Tahoe Live Web Chat: The Recap] from GM Authority (September 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; GM offered another off-road variant or trim for the Suburban and Yukon XL starting with the eleventh generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/24/gm-mulling-off-road-variants-fullsize-suvs/ GM mulling off-road variants of fullsize SUVs] from Autobog (September 24, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; With the relaunch of the Z71 package in the Suburban for the 2015-2020 models, GM filed papers to trade mark the Trail Boss name for use on future Chevrolet truck and SUV models, although they were never used for the Suburban trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/01/26/gm-gmc-chevy-z71-trail-boss-trademark-report/ "GM files for Z71 Trail Boss trademark"] from Autoblog (January 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety and fuel economy were the reasons for GMC to no longer offer an AWD in the Yukon Denali XL after the 2014 model year, and there are no volume controls or devices in the rear seating area to operate the DVD system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPaJzil0AuU "2015 GMC Yukon Google+ Hangout"] from YouTube (November 6, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept versions===
On November 4, 2013, Chevrolet unveiled a concept design for the Suburban called the Half-Pipe, whose features include roof racks and crossbars to mount skis, at the [[SEMA]] Show. Afterwards, Chevrolet made its parts available for order at Chevrolet Accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/11/sema-2013-chevy-suburban-half-pipe-concept-is-a-better-way-to-get-to-the-slopes/ SEMA 2013: Chevrolet Suburban Half-Pipe Concept Is A Better Way To Get To The Slopes] from GM Authority (November 4, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[SEMA Show#2017|2017 SEMA Show]], a 4x4 off-road Suburban concept inspired by Country singer (and Chevrolet spokesman) [[Luke Bryan]] based around his 2016 song “[[Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Every Day]]” was introduced, decked out in custom Hunter Bronze exterior color with Dark Carbon accents and camo graphics, a roof-mounted light rack and a custom lower fascia, a liftgate re-engineered to swing outward rather than upward and incorporates a custom spare tire mount, 22-inch wheels with 35-inch-tall tires, roof-mounted equipment carrier with a fishing rod holder, an interior design consisting of Black and Two-Tone Olive with Argon Orange, unique seating featuring Argon piping and Platinum camo-pattern perforated designs, and the “Huntin’, Fishin’ and Lovin’ Every Day” badges (designated by symbols in lieu of the words) displayed on both the exterior and interior. The rear windows are removed. The concept was inspired by Bryan himself and collaborated with Chevrolet on this project as he is an owner of a Suburban: “Chevy has been part of our family and a part of our work life on the farm for as long as I can remember,” says Bryan. “If you were a Bryan, you drove a Chevy — and I’m a longtime Suburban owner. This partnership is a natural fit for me and this unique Suburban represents everything I and my family want for our outdoor adventures.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2017/oct/sema/trucks-suv/1030-suburban-concept.html "LUKE BRYAN SUBURBAN CONCEPT FOR HUNTIN', FISHIN' AND MORE"] from Media.Chevrolet.com (October 30, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2017/10/30/luke-bryan-chevy-suburban-sema-2017/ “Luke Bryan Chevy Suburban is a rolling hunting blind”] from Autoblog (October 30, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermarket options===
In 2014, [[Callaway Cars]] offered an upgraded supercharged package to the Suburban for an additional $17,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoweek.com/article/20140211/CARNEWS/140219963 "Callaway supercharges 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban"] from Autoweek (February 11, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Corsa Performance added a cat-back exhaust system package for customers looking to upgrade their K2XX Suburban or Yukon XL, which would give the 5.3L versions a 669% flow increase and the 6.2L versions a 342% flow increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/09/corsa-release-cat-back-exhaust-system-for-suburban-yukon-xl/ "Corsa Announces Cat-Back Exhaust For K2XX Chevy Suburban, GMC Yukon XL"] from GM Authority (September 25, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Freedom Mobility partnered with GM to have their trucks and SUVs equipped with features that will make it accessible to disabled and visible/hearing impaired drivers or passengers. The Suburban is among the selected vehicles that will be available with this option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/06/chevrolet-gmc-cadillac-trucks-and-suvs-get-wheelchair-accessible-via-freedom-motors/ “Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac Trucks and SUVs Get Wheelchair Accessible Via Freedom Mobility”] from GM Authority (June 11, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Reviews===
The news of the redesigned Suburban and Yukon XL (2015-2020 version) have so far been met with positive reviews from automotive critics who praised GM's devotion and commitment to keeping the Suburban and its sister SUVs in production due to their popularity and sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/chevrolet_suburban_2015 2015 Chevrolet Suburban – Review] from The Car Connection (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2015-chevrolet-tahoe-and-suburban-revealed/2000009681/ 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban revealed] from Kelly Blue Book (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2015-chevrolet-suburban-photos-and-info-news "2015 Chevrolet Suburban: 80 years on, Chevy's big workhorse is still plugging away."] from Car and Driver (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadandtrack.com/go/first-looks/first-look-2015-chevrolet-tahoe-and-suburban-suvs "Here's the 2015 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe: America's greatest utility vehicle, and its kid brother."] from Road &amp; Track (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

A test drive that was done on February 25, 2014 received positive reviews for its speed, handling, technology, and performance from The Fast Lane,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tflcar.com/2014/02/review-2015-chevrolet-suburban-2015-chevrolet-tahoe-first-drive-review/ "Video: 2015 Chevrolet Suburban and 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe First Drive and Review"] from The Fast Lane (February 26, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and an overall 9 rating (out of 10) from Canada's Autonet.ca.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20140301224934/http://www.autonet.ca/en/2014/03/01/first-drive-2015-chevrolet-tahoe-and-suburban-gmc-yukon-and-yukon-xl "FIRST DRIVE: 2015 CHEVROLET TAHOE AND SUBURBAN, GMC YUKON AND YUKON XL"] from Autonet.ca (February 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Truck Trend'' quoted that they never really thought of the Suburban and Yukon XL as "one-percent" vehicles (referring to their previous generations and its upper-class and family-oriented customers), they're now solidly "ten-percenters" with the updated versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucktrend.com/roadtests/suv/163_1402_2015_chevrolet_tahoe_suburban_gmc_yukon_first_drive/ "2015 Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon, XL, and Denali First Drive"] from Truck Trend (February 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

However at the same time it saw mixed comments about the eleventh generation version from message boards like [[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]] and Chevrolet's Facebook page, mainly about the front grille, its boxy design, GM's decision to not include additional or optional features to the Suburban, like a Duramax engine, and the conspicuous absence of the "2500" (or 3/4 ton) version in the current production lineup or making it available for sale to the public (at the time). In a review from Automobile Magazine, writer Greg Migliore notes that despite the reception from both sides and the possibility that other automakers might exit the large SUV segment, that with this 11th generation, "GM is clearly hoping the Suburban makes it to the century mark."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1309_2015_chevrolet_suburban_and_tahoe_gmc_yukon_xl/ 2015 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe, 2015 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL Revealed] from Automobile Magazine (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Detroit News]]'' gave the 2016 Suburban LTZ a 4 star (excellent) rating, this after comparing the SUV with the [[Fiat 500L]] in an experimental test inspired by [[Pope Francis's 2015 visit to North America]], in which the Pontiff used the 500L, which is the equivalent of the President of the United States' armored Suburban&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/henry-payne/2015/10/07/payne-papal-fiat-vs-presidential-chevy-suburban/73553932/ "Payne: Papal Fiat 500L vs. Presidential Chevy Suburban"] from ''[[The Detroit News]]'' (October 7, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 model also got a workout of sorts at the Florida International Rally &amp; Motorsports Park to test its abilities on the racetrack, where it performed successfully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/12/how-does-the-2016-chevrolet-suburban-handle-itself-at-the-track-video/ "How Does The 2016 Chevrolet Suburban Handle Itself At The Track? (Video)"] from GM Authority (December 28, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The twelfth generation Suburban received positive reviews based on its design and features, although there were criticism from Chevrolet's social media sites and automotive website forums about the vehicle's look, citing its resemblance to the fifth generation Ford Expedition MAX and the standard full size [[Hyundai Palisade]], due to having the same exterior design language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cars.com/articles/2021-chevrolet-suburban-and-tahoe-the-general-did-its-homework-414918/ "2021 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe: The General Did Its Homework"] from Cars.com (December 11, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2019/12/10/the-original-suv-chevrolet-suburban-and-tahoe-gets-bigger-and-smoother-for-2021/#c9d8c2c507f5 "The Original SUVs, Chevrolet Suburban And Tahoe, Get Bigger, Smarter And Smoother For 2021 "] from Forbes (December 10, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also getting criticism from climate groups who accuse GM of spending billions on promoting SUVs like the Suburban instead of efficient vehicles, as Dan Becker of Safe Climate Campaign points out, “GM claims that they are merely meeting consumer demand for gigantic vehicles, but most consumers don’t use their pickups and SUVs for lumber and machinery but to haul lattes home from [[Starbucks]],” an issue GM has addressed on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/climate-groups-critique-gm-amid-new-chevrolet-suv-rollout/ "Climate Groups Critique GM Amid New Chevrolet SUV Rollout"] from GM Authority (December 16, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
The 2015 Suburban was ranked third among the top affordable SUVs and fifth among affordable SUVs with 3-row seats by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Chevrolet_Suburban/ "2015 Chevrolet Suburban"] from ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' (June 20, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and was among the finalists in ''[[Motor Trend]]'s'' SUV of the year for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/suv/2015_suv_of_the_year_contenders_and_finalists/chevrolet_suburban.html "Finalist: Chevrolet Suburban"] from ''Motor Trend'' (January 10, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It also received a 2015 [[MotorWeek Drivers' Choice Awards|MotorWeek Drivers' Choice Award]] for best large SUV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorweek.org/reviews/drivers_choice_awards/#/best-large-utility "2015 Driver's Choice Award"] from ''[[MotorWeek]]'' (February 13, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' ranked the Suburban as the best SUV with a third row seat, topping its competitors in this category.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-worst-three-row-vehicles-110000189.html "Best &amp; worst three-row vehicles"] from ''[[Consumer Reports]]''/[[Yahoo!]] (June 26, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, 2016, the Chevrolet Suburban took third place behind the Tahoe and GMC Yukon in the 2016 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study among full-size SUVs, based on responses from owners of the vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/05/gms-full-size-suvs-sweep-full-size-suv-segment-in-2016-j-d-power-vehicle-dependability-study/ "GM’s Full-Size SUVs Sweep Full-Size SUV Segment In 2016 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study"] from GM Authority (May 31, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, [[Good Housekeeping]] named the 2018 Suburban the “Best New Car of Year 2018” in the Large SUV category. In its review of the vehicle from GH and its reason for the decision to award the SUV: “Whether you're bringing the whole soccer team home or moving kids into college, it's a larger-than-life workhorse that can handle your crew and all their stuff.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/travel-products/car-reviews/g5081/new-car-awards-2018/ “The Best New Cars of 2018”] from [[Good Housekeeping]] (February 12, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' added the 2018 Suburban to their recommended list due to high owner satisfaction scores.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cheatsheet.com/automobiles/the-suvs-that-scored-new-consumer-reports-recommendations-for-2019.html/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suburban was given a [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star on December 5, 2019, one of two inanimate objects to be awarded such ([[Disneyland]] being the other), for its frequent appearances in film and television. Because city regulations prohibit placing corporate names on public sidewalks including the Walk of Fame, the star was instead placed in an area adjacent to the Walk of Fame.&lt;ref name="freep.com"/&gt;

==Sales==
The interest in the redesigned eleventh generation Suburban has also translated into surging sales. In April 2014 it saw a 109.8 percent spike with most dealers reporting that the vehicles are being sold within 10 days after it arrives on the dealership lots with customers opting for the fully loaded LTZ model, making it one of Chevrolet's fastest selling brands in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/05/chevrolet-says-demand-for-2015-suburban-and-tahoe-higher-than-expected/ "Chevrolet Says Demand For 2015 Suburban And Tahoe Higher Than Expected"] from GM Authority (May 7, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The eleventh generation Suburban is also a hot seller in the Middle East, where in August 2014 posted a 37% increase in sales, with most of the purchases coming from Saudi Arabia (65%), the United Arab Emirates (15%) and Qatar (108%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/09/chevrolet-middle-east-suv-and-pickup-sales-up-35-percent-in-august/ "Chevrolet Middle East SUV and Pickup Sales Up 35 Percent In August"] from GM Authority (September 16, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of September 2014, GM sold more than 4101 units of the Suburban (up 50.1%), while the Yukon XL posted 2165 units sold (up 64%), with GM boasting that 80% of the vehicles sold were its large SUVs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/1410_gm_september_2014_sales_grow_19_percent_pickups_on_top.html "GM September 2014 Sales Grow 19 Percent, Pickups on Top"] from Motor Trend (October 1, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, sales of the Suburban reached 966 units (up 43%) in 2014, although the Yukon XL is the best seller in that country with 1,760 vehicles sold (up 50.3%) that same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/search/label/Large%20SUV%20Sales?max-results=5 2014 Large SUV Sales] from Good Car Bad Car (January 15, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, they account for 70 percent of GM Canada's SUV sales for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wheels.ca/car-reviews/2015-chevrolet-suburban-lt-4wd-review/ "2015 Chevrolet Suburban LT 4WD Review"] from Wheels.ca (February 17, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2015, GM confirmed plans to increase production on its large SUVs, especially on the Suburban/Yukon XL, due to lower gas prices and a higher demand for the vehicles. The move also resulted in its Arlington Assembly adding more hours and increasing its production from 48,000 SUVs to 60,000 based on the expanding hours and added Saturday overtime shifts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20150813/OEM01/150819925/gm-said-to-be-boosting-production-of-big-suvs-pickups "GM Said To Be Boosting Production Of Big SUVs, Pickups"] from Automotive News (August 17, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 MY Suburban saw its biggest sales increase in January 2017, when it posted a 72.3% gain (5,634 units), the most ever since January 2008 when it had the 2008 MY Suburban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/02/chevrolet-suburban-sales-numbers-figures-results-january-2017/ "Chevrolet Suburban Sales Up 72.3% In January 2017"] from GM Authority (February 24, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

When production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle in 2001. In 2005, LSSV production switched to [[AM General]], a unit of [[MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings]]. The LSSV is a GM-built [[Chevrolet Silverado#First Generation (1999-2007)|Chevrolet Silverado 1500]], [[Chevrolet Silverado#Heavy Duty|Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD]], [[Chevrolet Tahoe#2001-2006|Chevrolet Tahoe]], or [[Chevrolet Suburban#Tenth Generation (2000–2006)|Chevrolet Suburban]] that is powered by a Duramax 6.6-liter turbo diesel engine. As GM has periodically redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001 to the present, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.&lt;ref name=LSSV&gt;{{cite web|title=Light Service Support Vehicle (LSSV)|url=http://olive-drab.com/idphoto/id_photos_lssv.php|website=Olive-Drab|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The militarization of the standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook, tow shackles and a 24/12 volt electrical system. The dashboard has additional controls and dataplates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.&lt;ref name="LSSV"/&gt; In the Canadian Army these vehicles are nicknamed "Milverado".

The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds an uprated suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking rear differential, beadlock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units have been sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.&lt;ref name=LSSV /&gt;

For the 2009 model year, the Suburban received the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s (NHTSA) best rating of 5 stars in the frontal driver/passenger and side driver/passenger categories.

===2015–present===
For the 2015 model year, the Suburban received an NHTSA rating of 4 stars overall, with the side driver/passenger categories receiving 5 stars. (Because of more stringent tests, 2011 and newer model ratings are not comparable to 1990–2010 ratings.) The NHTSA gave the 2016 models 4 stars overall in its review, similar to its review of its 2015 models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2016-chevrolet-suburban-earns-four-star-safety-rating-from-federal-government.html |title=2016 Chevrolet Suburban Earns Four-Star Safety Rating From Federal Government |publisher=Edmunds |date= July 15, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It gave the Suburban an Acceptable rating along with the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]] and [[GMC Yukon|Yukon]]. The [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]] also got an Acceptable rating.

====2000–06 Suburban====

The Suburban, [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]], [[GMC Yukon]] and [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]] a Good rating and a Best Pick. However, all four including the Yukon XL got a Good rating for head protection in side and seats and head restraints.

====2007–14 Suburban====

The Suburban, [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]], [[GMC Yukon|Yukon]] and [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]] earned a Good rating in the front offset. However, 2007–09 models without side airbags got a Poor rating. Models with them got a Marginal rating. 2010–14 models got a Top Safety pick.

====2015–present models====

All of the [[GMT K2XX|K2XX]] SUVs received a top safety pick, except for the Chevrolet / GMC 1500 series pickups, which have not been tested. The pickups have been tested against the moderate overlap test, for which they received a good rating.

===Recalls===
On March 28, 2014, GM announced a recall on the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL in order to fix a "transmission oil cooler line that is not securely seated in its fitting," causing the vehicle to stop and rupture the oil cooling line, resulting in the engine to malfunction and catch fire immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20140328/BUSINESS0101/303280161/general-motors-gm-recalls-suburban-yukon-cruze "GM recalls another 680,000 trucks, cars, adding to quality woes"] from [[Detroit Free Press]] (March 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The move comes on the heels on an incident that happened on March 23, 2014, when a 2015 GMC Yukon caught fire in [[Anaheim, California]] during a test drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gmc-yukon-fire-test-drive-20140324,0,4338091.story "GMC Yukon erupts into flames during test drive in Anaheim"] from ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (March 24, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being an isolated incident, the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL are not tied to GM's announced recall of its vehicles (from previous generation models and discontinued brands that were produced prior to, during, and after GM's restructuring in 2010) that was made on March 17, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/17/gm-3-recalls-1.7-million-cars-barra-video/ "GM announces 3 new recalls affecting 1.7M vehicles in North America (w/video)"] from Autoblog (March 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2014, GM issued another recall on the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL because their radio control modules may not work, and thus prevent certain audible safety warnings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/06/gm-issues-4-recalls-90k-vehicles-chevy-buick-gmc/ "GM issues 4 new recalls for 90k vehicles, Chevy, Buick, GMC affected"] from Autoblog.com (June 6, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This would be followed on June 27 with another recall, in which the transfer case "may electronically switch to neutral without input from the driver," adding that if this occurs while the vehicle is moving, power will not be sent to the wheels, meaning that if the vehicle is parked, it may roll away unexpectedly if the parking brake has not been set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/27/gm-announces-four-new-recalls-507k-cars-official/ "GM announces four new recalls, 507k vehicles affected"] from Autoblog (June 27, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2014, GM announced that it is replacing ignition key units on the 2015 Suburban and Yukon XL after customers made complaints that the shift lever strikes the head of the key if the tilt-adjustable steering column is in the fully up position. The lever only can be moved out of "park" into a gear when the engine is running and the driver's foot is on the brake. The push-button ignition features are not affected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/12/05/gm-new-trucks-ignition-key-replace/19916919/ "GM replaces ignition keys on new trucks"] from USA Today (December 5, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2015, GM issued a recall on tenth-generation Suburbans and Yukon XLs from the 2011 and 2012 model years for a potential ignition lock actuator issue, citing that they are not the right size and can cause the ignition to get stuck in the "Start" position, and then either due to a jarring event or a "cool interior temperature" the ignition could switch back to the "Accessory" position, resulting in a loss of power assistance and prevent the airbags from deploying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/01/04/gm-recall-suv-ignition-switch/ "GM recalls 83,572 SUVs for ignition switch issue"] from ''Autoblog'' (January 4, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2015, the NHTSA revealed that it had received complaints from 2015 Suburban/Yukon XL owners about buffeting and vibration problems causing drivers and passengers to endure an annoying vibration inside the cabin so severe that it leads to dizziness and headaches. GM is aware of this and has moved to correct the situation and try to pinpoint the source, but assures the vehicles are safe to drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/12/30/fullsize-gm-suvs-making-owners-sick-report/ "Fullsize GM SUVs have a problem that's making owners sick"] from Autoblog (December 30, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2016, GM placed a recall on both 2016 model Suburbans and Yukon XLs over inadequate welds on their upper front control arms, which could result in an accident or injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/05/general-motors-chevrolet-gmc-cadillac-full-size-truck-suv-recall-front-upper-control-arms/ "General Motors Recalls 2016–2017 Full-Size Trucks And SUVs Over Issue With Front Upper Controls"] from GM Authority (May 3, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2017, GM issued a recall on 2016 and 2017 Chevrolet Suburban HD models over an improperly fixed right-hand rear-view outside mirror which GM says will replaced for free. The recall affected 211 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/02/2016-2017-chevrolet-suburban-hd-mirror-recall/ 2016–2017 Chevrolet Suburban HD Recalled Over Right Hand Outside Mirror] from GM Authority (February 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1999, GM re-branded the GMC Suburban as the Yukon XL. GM discontinued tracking sales of the Yukon XL in 2018 and now includes them with the sales of the Yukon. The sales on this chart reflect the number of Chevrolet Suburban units sold from 2018 onward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/08/gmc-yukon-sales-numbers-figures-results-second-quarter-2018/ “GMC Yukon Sales Increase 17.5% To 19,520 Units In Q2 2018”] from GM Authority August 13, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Chevelle ''' is a [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] automobile which was produced by [[Chevrolet]] in three generations for the 1964 through 1977 [[model year]]s. Part of the [[General Motors]] (GM) [[GM A platform|A-body]] platform, the Chevelle was one of Chevrolet's most successful nameplates. [[Body style]]s include coupes, sedans, convertibles and station wagons. Super Sport versions were produced through the 1973 model year, and [[Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna|Lagunas]] from 1973 through 1976. After a four-year absence, the [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]] was reintroduced as part of the new Chevelle lineup in 1964. The G-body [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]], introduced in 1970, also used a platform that was based heavily on the Chevelle platform, although it was lengthened ahead of the firewall. The [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]], the top of the line model through 1972, completely replaced the Chevelle nameplate for the redesigned, downsized 1978 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gunnell |first=John |title=Standard Catalog of Chevrolet, 1912-2003: 90 Years of History, Photos, Technical Data and Pricing |year=2011 |location=Cincinnati |publisher=F+W Media, |isbn=9781440230554 |oclc=1058297344 |page=204 https://books.google.com/books?id=YhRjDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=9781440230516&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YhRjDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=They+were+no+longer+called+Chevelles.+“The+1978+Malibu+from+Chevrolet”+said+the+year%27s+sales+catalog#v=onepage&amp;q=They%20were%20no%20longer%20called%20Chevelles.%20“The%201978%20Malibu%20from%20Chevrolet”%20said%20the%20year's%20sales%20catalog&amp;f=false |quote=They were no longer called Chevelles.

===First generation (1964–1967)===

====Overview====
The automobile marketplace was changing significantly during the early 1960s and became highly competitive in the smaller-sized car segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubenstein |first=James M. |title=The Changing U.S. Auto Industry: A Geographical Analysis |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134936298 |pages=144–147 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IMiHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=US+automobile+market+changing+early+1960s |accessdate=5 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domestic [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automakers]] (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) were responding to the success of [[American Motors]]' compact [[Rambler American]] and [[Rambler Classic|Classic]] models that made AMC the leading maker of small cars for several years and increasing Rambler on the 1961 domestic sales charts to third-place behind Chevrolet and Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell |first=John |title=American Cars of the 1960s: A Decade of Diversity |year=2005 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=0896891313 |page=164 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uaugkWcuACUC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=1961+Rambler+third+place+in+charts |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The innovative [[Chevrolet Corvair]] and the [[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova|Chevy II]], which was designed to compete with [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford's Falcon]], were losing ground.&lt;ref name="Genat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genat |first=Robert |title=Chevrolet SS |year=2000| publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9780760307151 |page=63 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N6U952OoE1sC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=Chevelle+was+designed+to |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford released the [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] [[Ford Fairlane (North America)|Fairlane]] in 1962, to which Chevrolet responded with the  1964 Chevelle based on a new [[GM A platform (1936)|A platform]] design.&lt;ref name="Genat"/&gt; Riding on a {{convert|115|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase, the new Chevelle was similar in size, simplicity, and concept to the standard-sized 1955–1957 Chevrolet models.&lt;ref name="Genat"/&gt; The Chevelle was the U.S. auto industry's only all-new car for 1964 and was positioned to fill the gap between the small Chevy II and the [[full-size car|full-sized]] Chevrolet models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunnell |first=John |title=Standard Catalog of Chevelle 1964-1987 |year=2003 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=1440225656 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q1FkFAQs5sMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=It+was+the+U.S.+auto+industry%27s+only+all-new+car+that+year.+It+fit+between+the+compact+Chevy+II+and+full-+size+Chevrolet+models |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in August 1963 by [[Semon Knudsen|"Bunkie" Knudsen]], the Chevelle filled the gap for Chevrolet with sales of 338,286 for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steffe|first=Jeffrey |title=Chevelle SS, 1964–1972: A Muscle Car Source Book |year=2004 |publisher=JC Publications |isbn=9780972986922 |page=6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O3Z8t5abzSoC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=And+fill+the+gap+they+did+with+sales+of+338,286+Chevelles+the+first+year |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-door [[hardtop]] coupes, and [[convertible]]s, four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedans]], and four-door [[station wagon]]s were offered throughout the entire run. This also included a coupe utility (El Camino) which was a derivative of the two-door wagon. In line with other Chevrolet series, the two-door hardtops were called Sport [[coupe]]s. Four-door hardtops, dubbed Sport Sedans, were available (1966 through 1972).  A two-door station wagon was available in 1964 and 1965 in the base 300 series. Station wagons were marketed with exclusive nameplates: Greenbrier (previously used with the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] based vans), Concours, and Concours Estate. Six-cylinder and V8 power was offered across the board. Chevelles were also assembled and sold in Canada. While similar to their stateside counterparts, the convertible was available in the base Chevelle series, a model never offered in the United States. The Chevelle was the basis for the [[Beaumont (automobile)|Beaumont]], a retrimmed model sold only in [[Canada]] by [[Pontiac]] dealers through 1969. Originally conceived as an upsizing of the [[Chevy II]] with a unibody platform (similar to the Fairlane and the full-size Chrysler B-platform of the same era) which originated with the XP-726 program, GM's "senior compact" A-platform used a body-on-frame construction using a suspension setup similar to its full sized automobiles with a four-link rear suspension (the differential has four control arms which are attached to the frame with rear coil springs sandwiched between the differential and spring pocket—this design was used with the B platform vehicles and later used by Ford Motor Company with its FOX platform automobiles).

====Chevelle SS====
[[File:1965 Chevelle Malibu SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Chevelle Malibu SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]

The Chevelle Super Sport, or [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]], represented Chevrolet's entry into the [[muscle car]] battle. Early 1964 and 1965 Chevelles had a Malibu SS badge on the rear quarter panel. Chevelles with the mid-1965 Z16 option, priced at US$1,501 in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. "Kelly", Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; had the emblem on the front fender as well as distinct in-house style numbers: 737 for the hardtop and 767 for the convertible.&lt;ref&gt;All Chevelles were 13000 series. Flory, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The $162 Super Sport package was available on the upscale Malibu two-door hardtop and convertible models; the option added special exterior brightwork with SS emblems and the 14-inch full-disc wheel covers from the [[Chevrolet Impala#Impala SS (1961–1969)|Impala SS]]. Inside, the vinyl bucket-seat interior featured a floor console for models equipped with the optional Muncie aluminum four-speed-manual or Powerglide two-speed automatic instead of the standard three-speed manual. Malibu SS also came with a four-gauge cluster in place of engine warning lights, and a dash-mounted tachometer was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Owners-Guide/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Manual-11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081345/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---May/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Owners-Guide/1965-Chevrolet-Chevelle-Manual-11 |archivedate=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The available 283-cubic-inch four-barrel V8 engine was rated at 220 horsepower, the same rating as the [[1957 Chevrolet]] Power-Pak 283 engine.

Starting in mid-1964, the Chevelle could be ordered with the division’s 327-cubic-inch V8, in either 250 or {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Both used a four-barrel carburetor and 10.5:1 compression. For 1965, Chevrolet also added the 350-hp 327 V8 as Regular Production Option (RPO) L79. 
A total of 294,160 Chevelles were built the first year, including 76,860 SS models.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Consumer Reports&lt;/ref&gt; After 1965, the Malibu SS badge disappeared except for those sold in Canada. A limited 201 Malibu SS396 'Z-16' [[big-block]]-equipped cars were also eventually produced starting in late 1965, with most being built between mid-March and mid-April.
[[File:66 Chevelle Malibu SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Chevelle Malibu Convertible]]
The Chevelle SS396 became a series of its own in 1966 with series/style numbers 13817 and 13867.
SS396 sport coupes and convertibles used the same Malibu sport coupe and convertible bodies with reinforced frames and revised front suspension: higher-rate springs, recalibrated shocks, and thicker front stabilizer bar, but with different exterior trim. They also had simulated hood scoops, red-stripe tires, and bright trim moldings. The performance engines available included three, 396 CID V8s – the standard, rated at {{convert|325|hp|abbr=on}}, an optional {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}}, and an optional {{convert|375|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively (the mid-horsepower 396 was rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}} for 1966 only and {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} thereafter). The SS396 series lasted from 1966 through 1968 before being relegated to an option package in 1969. The 1966 and 1967 model years were the only two years of the 'strut back' 2-door sport coupe with its own style number, 17.&lt;ref name="Flory, p.434"&gt;Flory, p.434.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, sporty Chevelles continued to wear "Malibu SS" badges for the 1966 and early 1967 model years. These Chevelles were available with the same equipment as non-SS Malibu models in the U.S., and did not get the domed hood or the blackout front and rear treatment.  Redline tires were not available on Canadian Chevelles in 1966.  A 1966 Malibu SS factory photo shows wheel covers on the car from the 1965 Impala.  The Canadian Malibu SS got its "SS" name from the "Sports Option" package under RPO A51 and was primarily a trim option.  This A51 option came with bucket seats, a center console (except when the three-speed manual transmission was ordered), standard full wheel covers, and the ribbed rocker panel moldings.  The "Malibu SS" emblems were carried over from the 1965 Malibu SS series.  This Canadian option could be ordered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine available at the time. Starting in January 1967, the Chevelle SS396 took over and became its own 138xx series, the same as in the U.S. Produced at the Oshawa, Ontario production facility, only 867 SS396 models were produced during 1967.

=====Z16 SS396=====
Only 200 regular production 1965 Z16 Chevelles were built at the Kansas City plant. The Z16 option included the convertible boxed frame, a narrowed rear axle and brake assemblies from the contemporary Impala, heavy-duty suspension, plus virtually all Chevelle comfort and convenience options.  The Z16 standard big-block 396 Turbo-Jet [[V8 engine|V8]] (fitted with hydraulic lifters instead of the solid lifters of the same motor used in the Corvette) came only with the Muncie wide-ratio four-speed manual transmission.  The rear panel of the Z16 had unique black and chrome trim which framed untrimmed Chevelle 300-style taillights (Malibu and Malibu SS models had bright silver-painted lens trim).

The prototype Z16 Chevelle was built at the Baltimore plant. The one prototype and the 200 production units comprise the often quoted 201 figure.  One convertible was reportedly specially built for Chevy General Manager Semon "Bunkie" Knudsen, but is understood to have been destroyed. Approximately 75 Z16s are presently accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.z16chevelle.com/Z16%20Registry.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Body 1966–1967====
1966 saw a complete restyle of the Chevelle on the previous frame that included smooth contours, a broad new grille and bumper treatment, and curved side windows. Bulging rear fender lines and a "flying buttress" roofline (tunneled into the "C" pillar) were highlights of the '66 hardtops, shared with other GM "A" body models. The new body reflected the "Coke bottle" body shape that became the fad for American cars in the mid-1960s.  A 4-door hardtop-styled Sport Sedan joined the Malibu series. It was an attractive car and was offered through 1972, but never achieved the high-production figures as the pillared sedan.  Chevelles continued in 300, 300 Deluxe, and Malibu trim. Available engines were a 327-cubic-inch V8 instead of either of the sixes, or the mid-level option, a 220-horsepower 283-cubic-inch V8. Options included a tachometer, mag-style wheel covers, and sintered-metallic brakes, four-way power seats, a tissue dispenser, and cruise control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet_Chevelle_Brochure/1966%20Chevrolet%20Chevelle-14.html|title=Directory Index: Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet/1966_Chevrolet_Chevelle_Brochure|work=oldcarbrochures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1967 Chevrolet Chevelle 300 Deluxe V8 4-dr, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Chevelle 300 Deluxe V8 four-door sedan]]

The 1967 models received a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps went into a new rear end with standard backup lights. "What you'll see inside," claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, "will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving." Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new dual master cylinder brake system incorporated a warning light.  Chevrolet also added 14" wheels and a three speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldride.com/library/1967_chevrolet_chevelle.html|title=1967 CHEVROLET CHEVELLE Information Specifications Resources Pictures|work=oldride.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; New safety equipment became standard, including a collapsible steering column.&lt;ref&gt;1967 Chevelle brochure&lt;/ref&gt; The SS396 continued as its own series with both sport coupe and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was dropped from the options list until late in the model year and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The manual-shift feature of the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was featured. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and special instrumentation.

===Overview===

The 1968 Chevelle received an all-new distinctly sculpted body with tapered front fenders and a rounded beltline. The car adopted a long-hood/short-deck profile with a high rear-quarter "kick-up". While all 1967 Chevelle models rode a {{Convert|115|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase, the 1968 coupes and convertibles now rode a {{convert|112|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. The sedans and wagons turned to a {{convert|116|in|mm|adj=on}} span. Tread width grew an inch front and rear. Hardtop coupes featured a semi-fastback, flowing roofline (with a long hood and short deck, mimicking the Camaro (which itself was an answer to the Ford Mustang). Top-trim models (including the SS 396 and new luxury Concours) featured GM's new Hide-A-Way wiper system. Lesser Chevelles would get that change later.

The entry level Chevelle 300 (131 - 132 VIN prefix) was available as a pillared coupe and/or station wagon (Nomad) while the 300 Deluxe and Nomad Custom (133 or 134 VIN prefix) had a 2-door hardtop added to the lineup (fourth and fifth VIN characters will be 37; with the previous 300 Deluxe the hardtop was available with the Malibu and SS396 but not the base 300/Deluxe in the USA not counting those produced for the Canadian market). The Super Sport (SS396 sport coupe, convertible, and El Camino pickup) became series on its own. Chevrolet produced 60,499 SS 396 sport coupes, 2,286 convertibles, and 5,190 El Caminos; 1968 was the only year the El Camino body style would get its own SS396 series designation (13880).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vehicle Profile: 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle |url=https://journal.classiccars.com/2013/07/01/1968-chevrolet-chevelle/ |website=The ClassicCars.com Journal |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government-mandated side marker lighting was incorporated, with early 1968 SS 396 light bezels seen with the SS 396 nomenclature - at some point in the later production cycle the engine callout had a 396 also shared with the Chevy II Nova SS (the side marker bezels, also sourced from the Chevy II Nova in 307, 327, and 396 displacements) had the engine displacement except for the six cylinder models). Black-accented Super Sports had F70x14 red-stripe tires and a standard 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch Turbo-Jet V8 engine with the special twin-domed hood; 350 and 375-horsepower 396 engines were optional. The SS 396 sport coupe started at $2,899 - or $236 more than a comparable Malibu with its 307-cubic-inch V8. All-vinyl bucket seats and a console were optional.  Three luxury Concours options became available in March 1968 for the 4-door sedan, the 4-door sport sedan (and the hardtop coupe) and consisted of special sound insulation, and a deep-padded instrument panel with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] accents and all-vinyl color-keyed interiors. Interiors were sourced and shared with select Buick, Oldsmobile, or Pontiac A body patterns - during the middle of the 1968 model year, some Chevrolet A-bodies (including the El Camino) ended up with interior door panels shared with the Buick or Oldsmobile A bodies (Special, Skylark) where supply and demand issues forced a substitution, and during the April 1968 production month in the wake of the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] there were some work stoppages e.g. strikes. A ribbed stainless steel panel was bolted to the rear taillight panel and a 'Concours By Chevrolet' emblem on the rear decklid. Other options included power windows and door locks. With the hardtop a rare option is a horseshoe floor shifter with integrated console (with bucket seats - sourced from the SS). These Concours options (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) should not be confused with the two Concours station wagons. At the time the ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7 Concours package was the equivalent of the Caprice. Also new for 1968 was the elimination of the term "sedan" for the 2-door pillar body style.  This was now called a coupe (or pillar coupe) while the 2-door hardtop remained a sport coupe.  These coupe/sport coupe designations would continue into 1969 as well.

The Concours Estate Wagon was one of four distinct Chevelle wagon models. A one-year [[Chevrolet Nomad|Nomad]], Nomad Custom was offered.

Regular Chevelle engines started with a {{convert|140|hp}} Turbo-Thrift six or the new {{convert|200|hp}} Turbo-Fire 307 V8, and a {{convert|325|hp}} version of the 327-cubic-inch V8. Manual transmission cars got GM's "Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)" smog pump. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967.

===Design Changes 1969–1972===
[[File:69 Chevelle SS396.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Chevelle SS396 Hardtop Coupe]]
'''1969''' Chevelles were billed as "America's most popular mid-size car." They showed only minor changes for 1969, led by revised front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights (which became a familiar Chevrolet trademark) with a revised front grille, now cast in ABS plastic, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. Taillight lenses were larger and more vertical, flowing into the quarter panels. Smaller side marker lighting bezels were phased in (shared with the Camaro and using the lens assembly as the previous year). Front vent windows (hardtop and convertibles only) began to fade away now that Astro Ventilation (first introduced on the 1966 Buick Riviera which was used a year earlier on the Camaro and Caprice) was sending outside air into several Chevelle models. The Chevelle lineup slimmed down to Nomad, 300 Deluxe/Greenbrier, Malibu/Concours, and Concours Estate series, and the base 300 series was history.  No longer a series of its own, the SS 396 turned into a $347.60 option package for any two-door model. That meant not just a convertible, sport coupe, or pickup, but even the pillared coupe and sport coupe in the lower-rent 300 Deluxe series (except the base 300 Deluxe El Camino pickup).  Fewer SS396-optioned 300 Deluxe coupes and sport coupes were built than their Malibu counterparts and they are solid gold for collectors. The Super Sport option included a 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem and a black rear panel. More potent editions of the 396 engine also made the options list, developing 350 or {{convert|375|hp}}. SS396s produced from this point on shared the same VIN prefix with the Malibu sport coupe (136), with the exception of the 300 Deluxe based SS396s using (134), where the original buildsheet and/or Protect-O-Plate (which is an aluminum tag included with the original sales invoice from Chevrolet dealers) can ID a genuine SS (especially for a numbers matching original which is unaltered); however, the VIN number alone cannot ID a genuine SS as in previous years. Around an estimated 323 Chevelle 2-door hardtops were fitted with an [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|L72 {{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] rated at {{convert|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,800 rpm and {{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]], where some Chevrolet dealers used the Central Office Production Order (this also included some Camaros and Novas of the same model year) - some COPOs were sold through select Chevrolet dealerships and out of the 323 COPO orders, a confirmed 99 were sold through the Yenko Chevrolet dealership in Canonsburg, PA. During the 1969 model year a police package (RPO B07) was available on the Chevelle 300 Deluxe 4-door sedan where some were optioned with the RPO L35 (396) motor along with a boxed frame (also shared with fleet orders e.g. taxicabs and rental cars); at the time the police option was reintroduced since the 1964/65 model years (at the time midsize squads came with economy powertrain usually in the case of the Chevelle a third generation Chevrolet inline six. The 300 Deluxe squads was not a sales success since the market was dominated by rival manufacturer Chrysler Corporation where its B platform (and its full sized sedans) outsold its competitors. Chevelle station wagons came in three levels: Concours, Nomad, and Greenbrier—the last a badge formerly used on the Corvair van. A new dual-action tailgate operated either in the traditional manner or as a panel-type door. Wagons stretched {{Convert|208|in|mm}} overall versus {{Convert|197|in|mm}} for coupes. Also the Concours option package (ZK5, ZK6, and ZK7) from the previous year was continued. 
New round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. Chevelle options included headlight washers, power windows and locks, and a rear defroster. Chevy's midsize production rose this year. About seven percent of all Malibus had a six-cylinder engine, while about 86,000 came with the SS 396 option. All 1969 Chevelles had a new locking steering column one year ahead of the Federal requirement,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RJLlTt-gB8edgweY-smBBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "The Popular Science Anti-Car-Theft Device Competition"] ''Popular Science", July 1969, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; and headrests required for all cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1969.

In 1969 Chevrolet developed a [[Steam car#Modern steam cars|steam powered concept vehicle]], designated the '''SE 124''' based on a Chevelle fitted it with a 50&amp;nbsp;hp [[Doble steam car#Bresler Brothers|Bresler]] steam engine in place of its gasoline engine.  The Bresler was based on the Doble steam engine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RJLlTt-gB8edgweY-smBBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "GM Takes Its Wraps Off Its Steam Cars."] ''Popular Science'', July 1969, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970 Chevrolet Chevelle===
In '''1970''', sheetmetal revisions gave the bodies a more squared-up stance following the coke bottle styling, and interiors were also redesigned. The 1970 Chevelle shared many sheet metal body parts with the 1970 Buick Skylark GSX, both are GM automobiles and have interchangeable sheet metal. They are  also the only two muscle cars to share the same roofline. The 1970 Chevelle came in Sport Coupe, Sport Sedan, convertible, four-door sedan, a couple of wagons, and [[coupé utility]] (the El Camino) body styles.  Only three of these (Malibu sport coupe, Malibu convertible and El Camino pickup) were available with a choice of one of two SS options; RPO Z25 with the SS 396 (402 cid) engine and RPO Z15 with the new 454 cid engine.  The base model was now simply called Chevelle in lieu of the former base 300 Deluxe, and was only available as a Sport Coupe or four-door sedan. In Canada, the base series retained its 300 Deluxe name, with appropriate badging on each front fender just behind the front wheel well. The 300 Deluxe 2-door sedan was cancelled and replaced by the base Chevelle Sport Coupe, a 2 door pillarless hardtop.  The hardtop, convertible, and sedan received the upgraded sheetmetal but the station wagons and El Camino retained the previous year sheetmetal panels (which went on for the next 2 model years). Station wagons were the entry level Nomad, the Chevelle level Greenbrier, the Malibu level Concours and an upscale Concours Estate. New options included power door locks and a stalk-mounted wiper control. Production was expanded to the [[Arlington Assembly|GM Arlington Assembly]] plant in Arlington, Texas (where the Chevelle was assembled with its corporate siblings in this case the Oldsmobile Cutlass).

Engine choices ranged from the standard {{convert|155|hp}} six-cylinder and 200-horsepower 307-cubic-inch V8, to a pair of 350 V8s and a pair of 402 engines. RPO Z25 SS equipment option included one of these 402 cid engines but was still marketed as a 396.  The second 402 cid engine was available under RPO, rated at 330&amp;nbsp;hp with single exhaust, and was available in any V8 series except an SS optioned Malibu or El Camino. 1970 also saw the introduction of the 454 cid engine and was only available with the RPO Z15 SS Equipment option. The base [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#454|{{convert|454|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine]] was rated at {{convert|360|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}}, which was also available with cowl induction; and the optional LS6 version equipped with a single 4-barrel 800 [[Cubic foot#Cubic foot per minute|CFM]] [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]] produced {{convert|450|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm and {{convert|500|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1964→1972-chevrolet-chevelle-ss454/|website=supercars.net|title=1964→1972 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454|accessdate=July 5, 2018|editor=Nick D. |date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heacockclassic.com/articles/the-best-muscle-car-1970-ls6-chevelle/|website=heacockclassic.com|title=The 1970 LS6 Chevelle Was America’s King Of The Streets|accessdate=July 5, 2018|editor=Paul Zazarine |date=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 4,475 LS6 Chevelles produced.

The SS 396 Chevelle included a {{convert|350|hp}} Turbo-Jet 396 V8, special suspension, "power dome" hood, black-accented grille, resilient rear-bumper insert, and wide-oval tires on sport wheels. Though a {{convert|375|hp}} cowl induction version was available, few were sold in favor of the newly introduced 454 engine during late-1969 timeframe. The LS5 454-cubic-inch V8 produced {{convert|360|hp}} in standard form and a cowl induction version was also available. The LS6 produced a claimed 450 gross HP in solid-lifter, high-compression guise.

"You can make our tough one even tougher," the brochure explained, by adding Cowl Induction to either the SS 396 or the SS 454. Step on the gas, and a scoop opened "to shoot an extra breath of cool air into the engine air intake....like second wind to a distance runner." Neither functional hood lock pins nor hood and deck stripes were standard with either SS option, but were part of the optional ZL2 cowl induction hood option. The {{convert|454|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} LS5 [[V8 engine|V8]] was rated at {{convert|360|hp|abbr=on}}.

===New design for 1971===
[[File:2019 Food &amp; Shelter Car Show 06 (1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS).jpg|thumb|1971 Chevrolet Chevelle SS]]

The '''1971''' Chevelles were treated to new front-end and rear-end styling that included large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. The grille was widened and featured a bright horizontal bar that divided it into two sections.  At the center of this bar was a large Chevy bowtie for Malibus, or a large "SS" emblem for the SS models.  The grille on the Super Sport was painted flat black, other models got a silver finished grille.  Base Chevelles got a thinner, plain bar with no ornamentation.  A small "Chevelle" nameplate was located in the lower left corner of the grille.  New dual round taillights were integral with the back bumper. Because SS models suffered heavy insurance surcharges, Chevrolet introduced the "Heavy Chevy" at midyear, which was based on the base Chevelle, and was available with any V8 engine except the 454, which was exclusive to SS models. The Heavy Chevy (RPO YF3) was only available with the base Chevelle sport coupe (13437) and was primarily a dress up option and even it was limited to options available on the standard Chevelle sport coupe; vinyl carpeting, front bench seat, no center console shift, etc.

Chevrolet specifications for 1971 included both "gross" and "net" horsepower figures for all engines. The standard Chevelle SS engine was a two-barrel 350-cubic-inch V8 rated at 245 gross (165 net) horsepower. Optional was a four-barrel carbureted version of the 350 V8 rated at 275 gross (200 net with dual exhaust and 175 net with single exhaust) horsepower. The 402 cid big-block engine continued to be optional as the SS 396 but was only available in one horsepower rating, 300 gross (260 net) horsepower, and was not available with cowl induction. The base LS5 454 V8 produced 365 gross and 285 net horsepower, but cowl induction was available that produced more power because of the air induction and louder exhaust system. The LS6 454 option, which was originally announced as a regular production option on the Chevelle SS for 1971, was dropped early in the model year and no official records indicate that any 1971 Chevelles were assembled with the LS6 engine.

For 1971, the SS option could be ordered with any optional V8 and became more of a dress-up option than a performance option. The SS option was reduced to one RPO code, RPO Z15, and was only available for the Chevelle Malibu.  This RPO code required any optional engine and transmission available in the Chevelle lineup.  Since the 307 V8 was the standard base V8 in 1971, it could not be ordered with the SS option; one had to order the LS3 402 or the LS5 454, or one of the two 350 V8 engines (L65 or L48 - which reintroduced the small block to the SS option for the first time since the 1965 model year for USA market Chevelles).

GM mandated all divisions design their engines to run on lower-octane regular, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. To permit usage of the lower-octane fuels, all engines featured low compression ratios (9:1 and lower; well below the 10.25-11.25:1 range on high-performance engines of 1970 and earlier). This move reduced horsepower ratings on the big-block engines to 300 for the 402 cubic-inch V8 but the LS5 454 option got an "advertised" five-horsepower increase to 365.

Both 350 V8 engines, as well as the dual exhaust 402 cid V8 engine, were available without the SS option; only the LS5 454 V8 required the SS option. A single exhaust version of the 402 cid engine existed in 1970 with 330 gross hp and in 1972 with 210 net hp.  In 1971 the single exhaust version of the 402 cid engine produced 206 net hp, but only appeared in the full size Chevrolet brochure.

[[File:1972 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu.jpg|thumb|right|1972 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Sedan]]
'''1972''' Chevelles featured single-unit parking/side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille. All Malibus had concealed wipers. The SS equipment option requirements remained the same as those in 1971, any optional V8. The 1972 Chevelle series had wide enough appeal to qualify as America's second-best-selling car. Base versions again included a four-model wagon series. Upscale versions were Malibus including the convertible models. More than 24,000 Malibu Sport Sedans were built, with a standard 307-cubic-inch V8 rated at 130 (net) horsepower. This 4-door hardtop used the same body as the 1968-71 models, and although it was attractive, it was the least popular body style in the lineup.  It was not available with the overhead-valve "Turbo-Thrift" six cylinder engine.  With that V8, the Malibu Sport Coupe was the top seller by far starting at $2,923. The six-cylinder version ran $90 less. Powertrain options included the 175-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V8 and 240-horsepower 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396), as well as a 454 that produced {{convert|270|hp}} under the net rating system. Chevelles sold in California were not available with the 307 V8, but had a 350-cubic-inch engine. Through the 1970s, California cars often had different powertrains than those marketed in states with less-stringent emissions regulations.

The 1972 Chevelle SS had a top engine rated at 270 net&amp;nbsp;hp (201&amp;nbsp;kW) conforming with GM's decree that all engines were to be rated at their net engine ratings. All other engines on the SS roster were unchanged from 1971.  1972 was the last year for the cowl induction option for the 454 cid engine and was not even mentioned in the 1972 Chevelle brochure.

Chevelle wagons measured {{convert|10|in|mm}} shorter than full-size wagons and weighed about half a ton less, but sold much slower. Model-year output totaled 49,352 Chevelles and 290,008 Malibus—plus 54,335 station wagons.

===The Yenko Chevelles===
Retired Corvair and Corvette [[race car]] driver [[Don Yenko]] (a Pittsburgh-area Chevrolet dealer) developed his own line of signature Chevelles, [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]]s and [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova]]s, marketed as Yenko Super Cars. At the time, the largest engine being installed in Chevelle SS's was the 396 cid [[V8 engine|V8]]. Yenko used the Central Office Production Order system, which normally filled special-equipment fleet orders, to create a special COPO 9562 that included the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|L72 {{convert|427|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] with a single 4-barrel 800 [[Cubic foot#Cubic foot per minute|CFM]] [[Holley Performance Products|Holley]] [[carburetor]] that produced {{convert|425|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm and {{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1969-chevrolet-chevelle-l72-427425hp-copo-9562-read-httpwww-supercars-netcars4352-htmlqu2bg0yaxezfuopt-99/|website=supercars.net|title=1969 Chevrolet Chevelle L72 427/425HP COPO 9562|accessdate=July 5, 2018|editor=Nick D |date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the needed drive train upgrades.A few other dealers ordered the package Yenko created and sold them as their own supercars.

===Overview===
[[File:1973 Chevrolet Chevelle.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Coupe]]
The most extensive redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, [[convertible]] and 4-door [[hardtop]] models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop was replaced by a [[Pillar (car)|pillared]] coupe—named "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-[[fastback]] roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled "B" pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear quarter glass on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. [[Wheelbase]] dimensions were retained;  a sporty {{Convert|112|in|mm}} for coupes and {{Convert|116|in|mm}} for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127&amp;nbsp;mm)  longer and an inch wider with a {{Convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.&lt;ref name="MT73"&gt;Motor Trend 1973 Buyers Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans to release the updated A-body lineup was scheduled for the 1972 model year but a strike which occurred at some GM assembly plants delayed the release for a full model year, eventually extending the lifecycle of the 1968-era generation; the redesigned A-bodies were designed in studio where it had more of a European influence - at the time of development John Z. DeLorean was the chairman at the Chevrolet division where he delayed some product releases and extending the lifecycle of some of its products; the redesigned A-bodies had some styling cues lifted from the concurrent second generation F-bodies - the front suspension was integrated into the A-body redesign with output from respective GM divisions (each division had its own sheetmetal design).

1973 models also introduced molded full foam front and rear seat construction, a flow-through power ventilation system, an inside hood release, a larger 22 gallon fuel tank, and "flush and dry" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets.
Another structural improvement was side-impact guard beams in the doors, as required by new [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]].&lt;ref name="MT73"/&gt; New options included swivel bucket seats with console for coupes and Turbine I steel-backed urethane wheels. A power moonroof was an option in 1973-75.&lt;ref&gt;1973–1977 Chevrolet Chevelle brochures&lt;/ref&gt; Interior roominess of the '73 Chevelle was improved, particularly in the rear. Headroom was up slightly and shoulder room gains were by {{Convert|1.6|in|mm}}. Rear seat legroom was up {{Convert|3.5|in|mm}} in sedans. Another was a {{convert|15.3|cuft|L|adj=on}} luggage capacity, an increase of {{convert|2.5|cuft|L}} over 1972 models. Still another benefit of the new body designs was greatly improved visibility, up 25% in coupes and wagons, and 35% in sedans. The unusually thin windshield pillars also contributed to much better visibility.

===New chassis===

The [[chassis]] design was new , with a sturdier [[perimeter frame]], revised chassis/body mounts, larger 8½&amp;nbsp;inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, revised rear control arm bushings, increased front and rear suspension travel, adjusted [[shock absorber]] location, and revised front suspension geometry&lt;ref&gt;Chevrolet engineering report-73 Chevelle&lt;/ref&gt; - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive [[camber angle|camber]] than the right which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining freeway stability. Clearances for spring travel were also revised; the [[coil spring]]s at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front [[disc brakes]] were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. [[John Z. DeLorean]], Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief period as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates.&lt;ref name="The Editors of Consumer Guide"&gt;The Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

Five power teams were available for 1973 Chevelle models; the 250 inline-six and 307 2-barrel V8 both rated at {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} were std. engines on Deluxe and Malibu. The 350 2-barrel V8 of {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was the base Laguna engine. Options for any Chevelle included a 350 4-barrel V8 of {{Convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at {{Convert|245|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. 3 speed manual transmission was standard; 4 speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic 3 speed automatic were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs that prevented air from entering the system prevented overheating.&lt;ref name="73brochure"&gt;1973 Chevrolet Chevelle Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revised model lineup===

[[File:1973 Chevelle Malibu SS.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Chevelle Malibu SS Colonnade Coupe]]

Malibu and the newly named Deluxe series base model featured the new {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper system with a large chrome front bumper and a chrome rear bumper. Malibu series interiors included cloth and vinyl or all vinyl seat trim and deep-twist carpeting.
Deluxe series interiors featured cloth and vinyl or knit vinyl seat trim. Floor coverings were color-keyed in vinyl-coated rubber.
The SS was now a trim option limited to the mid-level Malibu series. Shoppers could even get an SS station wagon this year - with the option of a 454-cubic-inch V8 engine, no less—but the mix of sport and utilitarian wagon virtues would last only a single season. Included was a black grill with SS emblem, lower bodyside and wheel opening striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, black taillight bezels, SS fender and rear panel emblems, special front and rear stabilizer bars, 14x7 inch rally wheels, 70-series raised white lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.&lt;ref name="73brochure"/&gt;
The SS option required an available 350 or 454 V8 with 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.

Chevrolet honored [[California]] beach resorts once again by naming the top Chevelle series [[Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna|Laguna]] with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe. In addition to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored [[polyurethane|urethane]] front end concealing the new [[5 mph bumper|5&amp;nbsp;mph bumper]] system. On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock- absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds; Laguna models also featured a specific [[die casting|diecast]] chrome [[grille]] with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]], front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna [[Woodie (car body style)|Estate]]. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.&lt;ref name="73brochure"/&gt;

Chevelle sales remained strong: 327,631 of them in the 1973 model year, plus 59,108 station wagons. The more upmarket Malibu continued to sell best by a wide margin and many Chevelles went to the fleet market, but the costlier Laguna coupe and sedan made a respectable showing, with 56,036 going to customers. Super Sport options went on 28,647 Chevelles of which 2500 held the big 454-cubic-inch engine. The SS option was dropped at the end of the model year.&lt;ref&gt;Cars of the 70's - By the Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes 1974–1977===
{{unreferenced-section|date=March 2020}}
{{originalresearch-section|date=March 2020}}

[[File:1974Laguna.JPG|thumb|left|1974 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna Type S-3 Colonnade Coupe]]
Yearly design changes to the front and rear mark the aesthetic differences as in previous years. The  Chevelles were top sellers for GM as was the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Buick Regal]], and [[Pontiac Grand Am#1973–1975|Pontiac Grand Am]] which used the same corporate [[GM A platform|A-body]] platform.

1974 Chevelles featured new Mercedes-inspired{{says who?|date=March 2020}} chrome grilles made of die-cast steel, and single rectangular [[Automotive lighting|tail lights]] replaced the dual round items on all coupes and sedans. More massive rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] were also added, in accordance with stricter US [[NHTSA|Federal standards]].

The Laguna, which had been Chevelle's top of the line model in 1973, now became the sporty Laguna Type S-3 and was only available solely as a coupe. It combined Laguna luxury with the upgraded handling of the SS, which it replaced. Handling was further enhanced with the addition of new GR70-15 [[radial tire]]s. The new Laguna S-3 sported the urethane front end with a revised grille and new parking lamps, and new tail lights. As on all 1974 models, a more massive rear [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] was installed to comply with new, stricter [[NHTSA|US Federal standards]]; those on the Laguna S-3 were chrome-plated rather than painted body color as on the 1973 car. Standard equipment included a console, a vinyl roof, opera-type vertical rear quarter windows which could be covered with horizontal ribs for a few dollars extra; body side striping, Laguna S-3 badging, rally wheels, a 4-spoke steering wheel, firmer springs and [[shock absorber]]s, a front [[anti-roll bar]], and HR70x15 radial tires on rally wheels. Interior features included swivelling front [[bucket seat]]s and a six-dial instrument cluster. Production totaled 15,792 cars, with prices starting at $3,723 - but with plenty of options to raise the price above $5,000. Engine offerings included a standard {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} providing {{convert|145|hp}} with a 2-barrel [[carburetor], with options for a {{convert|150|hp}} 2-barrel or {{convert|180|hp}} 4-barrel {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and a {{convert|230|hp}} {{convert|454|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, except in California where a {{convert|155|hp}} 350 four-barrel V8 was standard and the 400 and 454 engines were optional. The 454 was available with GM's [[Turbo Hydramatic|THM-400 automatic]] or Muncie 4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] transmission. Unitized 3-point [[seat belt]]s were introduced as on all Chevrolet models.

The upscale luxury trim level for 1974 was the new Malibu Classic, offered in sedan, coupe, and station wagon models. Unlike the 1973 Laguna, the Malibu Classic used the same front end and chrome bumper as the lesser models, and had the smaller vertical [[opera window]]s and a spring-loaded [[hood ornament]]. Early-production 1974 Classic coupes required the vinyl roof option; apparently{{says who?|date=March 2020}} inserts were used to cover part of the big rear quarter window.{{CN|date=March 2020}} Later-built cars were available with a standard painted roof that included the smaller opera window. This configuration was continued through the end of Chevelle production in 1977. Inside, the Malibu Classic interiors had notchback bench seats{{what?|date=March 2020}} upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels, and simulated woodgrain instrument panel trim. Optional on Malibu Classic coupes were swivelling [[bucket seat]]s in cloth or vinyl. The base Deluxe series was dropped for 1974, making the Malibu the base model. Base engines were the {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[straight-six engine]] and the 350 V8.

[[File:1974 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Estate (front).jpg|thumb|1974 Chevelle Malibu Estate]]
For 1975 although the basic body styling was unaltered, the "Colonnade" designation was dropped. Front and rear styling refreshes including a vertical grid-patterned grille and new bright trim around the headlights. Rectangular tail lights sat flush with the body surface, connected by a brushed chrome panel. Malibu Classic coupes had distinctive opera windows. Landau coupes came with a vinyl roof, full wheel covers, whitewall tires, color-keyed body striping, and dual sport mirrors. Engines ranged from the standard 250 six and 350/2-barrel V8 to options of 400 and 454-cubic-inch size, the last with a 235-horsepower rating. Variable-ratio [[power steering]] was now standard with V8 models, and all 1975 models came with steel-belted [[radial tire]]s and a [[catalytic converter]]. A new "Chevrolet Efficiency System" included GM's new [[High energy ignition]] (HEI) for longer tune-up intervals and more complete combustion. [[Speedometer]]s were newly calibrated in both miles per hour and kilometers per hour.

Following its debut as a 1974 model, the sporty Laguna Type S-3 left the lineup briefly, then reappeared in January 1975 with a slanted, urethane-covered aero-style nose designed for NASCAR (first use on a Chevrolet vehicle - later to show up on the 1983-88 Monte Carlo SS), louvered quarter windows, and could be ordered with a vinyl half-roof. The 454 engine option was available for the first half of the model year after which the 400 engine became the top engine. Options included an Econominder gauge package, affirming again that the age of muscle was long gone.

1976 Chevelles earned a billing{{says who?|date=March 2020}} as "a size whose time has come."{{CN|date=March 2020}} The top-of-the-line Malibu Classic got a crosshatch grille flanked on each side by two stacked newly-legal [[Parabolic aluminized reflector#Automotive headlamps|rectangular sealed-beam headlamps]], while lesser models had a waterfall grille and continued with the previous single round lamps. Three V8 enginess were available: a new {{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine rated at {{convert|140|hp}}, a {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine providing {{convert|165|hp}}, and a {{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine with {{convert|175|hp}}. Options included the Econominder gauge package.{{vague|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}} In its third and final year, the 1976 Laguna Type S-3 was little changed. It again featured quarter window louvers and a sloped, body-color urethane front end. Lagunas shared their round-gauge instrument panel with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, and could be ordered with a four-spoke sport steering wheel as well as swivel front bucket seats and a center console. Lesser models made do with a more conventional dashboard and a linear-readout speedometer. Production of the Laguna edged up to 9,100 cars as the base price went to $4,621.

The 1977 Chevelles got new grilles. The lineup consisted of Malibu and Malibu Classic models in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles. Estate Wagons and the Laguna Type S-3 were gone. Malibu Classics, again the top model, switched to a vertical grille pattern and six-section taillights but kept their twin stacked headlights and stand-up hood ornament. Malibu grilles changed little. Fewer engine selections were available though the engines that remained gained a few horses. In standard form, Chevelles had a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine or a {{convert|145|hp}}, 305 V8. The sole option beyond that was a {{convert|170|hp}}, four-barrel 350 V8, which came as standard equipment in the Malibu Classic station wagon. Malibu Classics had a luxurious cloth/vinyl split-bench front seat, color-keyed steering wheel, and woodgrain-accented instrument panel. Malibu options included a $46 Exterior Decor group, $54 tinted glass, and $33 full wheel covers. A total of 37,215 Malibu Classic Landau coupes were produced, as opposed to 73,739 Malibu Classic coupes and 28,793 Malibu coupes. In four-door sedan form, too, the Malibu Classics outsold base models by a substantial margin.

A Chevelle SE (special edition) was available and provided front and rear spoilers, turbine II wheels, F60-15 tires, special graphics and decals, quarter window trim, front and rear sway bars, sport suspension, and a deluxe interior. Three colors{{which?|date=March 2020}} were available. 50 of these cars were built. 

1977 models were the last ones to bear the Chevelle name; with the all-new 1978 models, Malibu became the basic name for Chevrolet's midsize cars.

''Speed and Supercar'' magazine said in a June 1974 "Street Test": "Chevy gets it right on." "Enough is plenty, that's how we feel about the 350 Laguna. "...&amp;nbsp;We couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell you what a groovy all around car it is even if it can't smoke the quarter-mile in 13 seconds. And what car in '73 can." "It's not overpowering but it's enough - and so comfortable that the editor bought the car." "The Laguna is the type of car you want to own for fast, comfortable transportation in quiet luxury."&lt;ref&gt;Speed and Supercar-June 1973: Driving impression 350 Laguna&lt;/ref&gt;

{{citation needed span|''[[Motor Trend]]'' - 1973 Buyers Guide said: "Chevrolet is fielding an all-new intermediate Chevelle series at a time when competitive lines from [[Ford Torino#1972–1976: Gran Torino|Ford]] and [[Plymouth Satellite#Third Generation (1971-1974)|Chrysler]] are one or more years old...when you look at what the stylists have done with what we used to call the pillar coupe, you might want to rush out and buy some stock in General Motors."|date=March 2015}}

{{citation needed span|''Motor Trend'' said: "The [[Pontiac Grand Am#1973–1975|Grand Am]] and the Laguna are large "small" cars. Nimble, quick and responsive."
"The cleanly styled Laguna has a lot to recommend it. The car has a very tight feeling, a by-product of the heavily ribbed underbody and double paneled roof. Strongly in the Laguna's favor is the integrated, body-colored urethane bumper-front end. It's a lot better looking out-front than the big bumper approach."|date=March 2015}}

{{citation needed span|''[[Car and Driver]]'' said: "[[Directional stability]] is so strong on the highway that the Laguna seems locked on some guidance-beam radiated from your destination." 
"The Laguna's urethane nose cap allows the front end to be flat and free of gaps in this day of jutting bumpers; its block-cut fenders are chauvinistically masculine, and no sheet metal is wasted cloaking its tires from view...so the Laguna looks like it could bowl over most of the cars on the road."|date=March 2015}}

[[File:NASCAR Chevelle Laguna- -11.jpg|thumb|Cale Yarborough's #11 Chevelle Laguna]]

The third generation Chevelle was an extensively used body style in NASCAR competition from 1973 to 1977.  The [[Chevrolet Laguna|Chevelle Laguna]] in particular was extremely successful allowing [[Cale Yarborough]] to win 34 races and earn the first two of three consecutive [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National]] championships. Considered a limited edition model by NASCAR, the Laguna S-3 was ineligible for competition following the 1977 season.

{{citation needed span|''Motor Trend'' said in 1973: "While neither Chevrolet or [[Pontiac]] are back in racing, the new crop intermediates out of GM's styling studios are curiously [[aerodynamic]]. They are also curiously competing on the [[NASCAR]] circuit tracks, and selling as fast as they can be hauled to the dealerships."|date=March 2015}}

October 21, 1973: American 500-Benny Parsons pits for repairs after an early crash. The help of several teams allow him to get back into the race and finish 28th. Parsons and his Chevelle hold on to win the NASCAR [[Winston Cup]] Grand National championship. Parsons took the points lead with a third-place finish at [[Talladega Speedway]] in early May and never gave up the lead. He held off a late rally by Cale Yarborough to win by only 67.15 points.

August 1976: Cale Yarborough drove his #11 Junior Johnson/Holly Farms Chevelle to the 1976 NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National championship. Yarborough won nine races along the way to the first of three consecutive titles. He finished last in the Daytona 500, but assumed command of the points chase in August. Yarborough beat Richard Petty by 195 points.

February 20, 1977: Daytona 500-Cale Yarborough Chevelle pulls away from Benny Parsons Chevelle in the final laps to win in his second Daytona 500. Cale Yarborough was running at the finish in all 30 NASCAR Winston Cup races as he dominated the 1977 season to wrap up his second consecutive title. Yarborough won nine races in 30 starts in his #11 Chevelle and finished 386 points ahead of runner-up Richard Petty.&lt;ref&gt;1973-77 NASCAR recap by the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Cruze''' is a [[compact car]] that has been made by the [[Chevrolet]] division of [[General Motors]] since 2008. The nameplate has been used previously in Japan, for a version of a [[subcompact car|subcompact]] hatchback car produced under a joint venture with [[Suzuki]] from 2001 to 2007, and was based on the [[Suzuki Ignis]].

Since 2009, the Cruze nameplate has designated a globally developed, designed, and manufactured four-door compact sedan—complemented by a five-door hatchback body variant (in 2010 it also replaced the Chevrolet Cobalt)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=21 April 2014|work=CNN|url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/04/17/news/companies/cobalt-failure/index.html|title=GM's recalled Cobalt was a failure from the start|accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2011, and a station wagon in 2012. The Cruze was actually released earlier in 2008 to the South Korean market under the name '''Daewoo Lacetti Premiere''' until the phasing out of the [[GM Korea|Daewoo]] brand in favor of Chevrolet in 2011. In {{not a typo|Australia}}, the model has been on sale since 2009 as the '''Holden Cruze'''. This new generation Cruze does not serve as a replacement for the Suzuki-derived Japanese market predecessor. Instead, it replaces three other compact models: the [[Chevrolet Optra]] sold internationally under various names (such as the [[Suzuki Forenza]] in the United States, Chevrolet Optra in Latin America and Canada, Chevrolet/Daewoo Lacetti in Europe and Asia), the [[Chevrolet Cobalt]], sold exclusively in North America, and the [[Opel]]-sourced, {{not a typo|Australia}}-market Holden Cruze (later returning in 2012 briefly as an Opel until the next year, and again in 2015 as a Holden).

While production of the Cruze in the United States and Mexico ended in 2019, the car is still produced and sold in other markets worldwide.

Before the release of the global Chevrolet Cruze [[compact car|compact]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] in 2008, [[General Motors]] made use of the name "Cruze" between 2001 and 2008 in Japan. Announced as the Chevrolet YGM1 [[concept car]] at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] in 1999, the original Cruze was derived from the [[subcompact car|subcompact]] [[Suzuki Ignis]] five-door [[hatchback]] (known as the [[Suzuki Swift]] in Japan).&lt;ref name="Cruze price bruise"&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton |first=Bruce |date=December 19, 2001 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/ADAABD7079C4FE09CA2572100028B88A |title=Cruze price bruise |work=GoAuto |publisher=John Mellor |accessdate=May 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005105930/http://goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/ADAABD7079C4FE09CA2572100028B88A |archivedate=October 5, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton |first=Bruce |date=September 6, 2000 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1984B8B98F6B29CFCA256AF500063925 |title=Suzuki acts swiftly on Ignis debut |work=GoAuto |publisher=John Mellor |accessdate=May 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018091100/http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/1984B8B98F6B29CFCA256AF500063925 |archivedate=October 18, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Chevrolet branding, the YGM1, like the production car, was the work of GM's Australian arm, [[Holden]].&lt;ref name = "Car review - Holden Cruze 5-dr wagon"&gt;{{cite web |last=Newton |first=Bruce |date=October 11, 2002 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/CA0C7BD665388785CA256C40000BDEED |title=Car review – Holden Cruze 5-dr wagon |work=GoAuto |publisher=John Mellor |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 19, 1999 |url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/newsarticle.html?&amp;A=51747 |title=Design By Holden, Engineering By Suzuki, Badge By Chevrolet |work=AutoWeb |publisher=Web Publications |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the styling, Holden executed most of the engineering work and were responsible for devising the "Cruze" nameplate.&lt;ref name = "Cruze price bruise"/&gt; The Cruze came either with a 1.3- or 1.5-liter engine coupled to either five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions.

[[General Motors]] (GM) ordered a recall on August 16, 2013, for 292,879 model year 2011 and 2012 Cruze models, manufactured at the [[Lordstown, Ohio]] plant United States. General Motors told the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] the recall was due to a potential intermittent loss of brake assist in Cruze models featuring the combination of the 1.4-liter dual overhead cam gasoline turbo engine and the 6T40 FWD automatic transmission. GM said it was aware of 27 alleged low-speed crashes due to brake issues that may include this particular issue, but it reported no injuries.
To address the issue, GM said dealers will replace a micro-switch in the power brake vacuum pipe assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Calia |first=Michael |date=August 16, 2013 |url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20130816-707236.html |title=GM to Recall Nearly 300,000 Chevy Cruze Models From 2011, 2012 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diesel model was discontinued, but a new chrome appearance package was offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/06/chevy-repurposes-first-gen-cruze-as-cruze-limited-for-fleet-customers/ "Chevy Repurposes First Gen Cruze as Cruze Limited For Fleet Customers"] from GM Authority (June 24, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trim levels (North America) ===
Between 2011 and 2016, the first-generation [[Chevrolet]] Cruze was available in several different trim levels:

'''L''' : The L, introduced in 2015, was positioned below the previously-base LS. Offering identical standard equipment as the LS described below, the base L omitted the standard front and rear carpeted floor mats that were standard equipment on the LS, and was only offered with a six-speed manual transmission.

'''LS''': Between 2011 and 2014, the LS was the base Cruze trim level, until the base L was added in 2015. Standard features of the LS included fifteen-inch black-painted steel wheels with full wheel covers, air conditioning, power windows and door locks, keyless entry, premium cloth seating surfaces, dual manually-adjustable front bucket seats, an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and auxiliary audio input jack with a six-speaker audio system, front and rear carpeted floor mats, tilt-and-telescopic vinyl-wrapped steering wheel with integrated audio system controls, a 1.8L [[EcoTec]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, a six-speed manual transmission, and a split-folding rear bench seat. Options included [[Bluetooth]] for hands-free telephone calls (no streaming audio capabilities), a six-speed automatic transmission, and [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]].

'''1LT''': Between 2011 and 2016, the 1LT was the value-oriented Cruze model. It added the following equipment to the base LS: sixteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], cruise control, and the [[OnStar]] in-vehicle telematics system. Options included the 1.4L Turbocharged [[EcoTec]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, a six-speed automatic transmission, [[Chevrolet MyLink]] seven-inch touch-screen infotainment system (2013+ models only), [[Bluetooth]] for hands-free telephone calls (no streaming audio capabilities) (later standard equipment in 2013+ models), a 290-watt premium amplified [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] audio system, a power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, a power sunroof, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and the RS Package.

'''Eco''': The Eco trim level, offered between 2011 and 2016 and based on the 1LT, was geared towards consumers who wanted a Cruze with higher [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] ratings. It added the following equipment to the 1LT: active front grille shutters, [[Bluetooth]] for hands-free telephone calls (no streaming audio capabilities- for 2011–2013 models only), [[Chevrolet MyLink]] touch-screen infotainment system (2013+ models only), a 1.4L Turbocharged [[EcoTec]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, a power-adjustable front driver's bucket seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a rear-mounted spoiler. Additional options were identical to that of the 1LT, though the Eco also offered luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with dual heated front bucket seats as part of an optional package.

'''2LT''': The 2LT trim level, offered between 2011 and 2016, added additional luxury and convenience features to the 1LT: a 1.4L Turbocharged [[EcoTec]] Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, [[Chevrolet MyLink]] seven-inch color touch-screen infotainment system (2013+ models only), luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with dual heated front bucket seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power sunroof, and a security system. Options included a six-speed automatic transmission, a 290-watt premium amplified Pioneer audio system, side blind zone alert with rear cross-traffic alert (2014+ models only), the RS Package, and GPS navigation.

'''LTZ''': The LTZ trim level, offered between 2011 and 2016, was the top-of-the-line Cruze trim level. It added additional luxury features to the 2LT, such as: premium aluminum-alloy wheels, remote start, a six-speed automatic transmission, and a 290-watt premium amplified Pioneer audio system. Options included GPS navigation and the RS Package.

'''Diesel''': The Diesel was a [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered version of the 2LT trim level of the Cruze, available for 2014 and 2015 only. It added unique seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, a six-speed automatic transmission, remote start, and a 2.0L Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) diesel engine to the 2LT trim level. Options were identical to that of the 2LT trim level, though the RS Package was not available on the Diesel.

The car was launched and began production for South America in 2011.

The new model was first announced for the [[China|Chinese]] market on the 2014 [[Shanghai Auto Show|Beijing Auto Show]] and went on sale in August 2014. Based on the same platform as the Cruze J300, the Cruze J400 CN was essentially a reskinned old model, and only sold for 2 years before the release of the international Cruze J400. The four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] has a [[fastback]]-like sloping roofline and a low drag coefficient of 0.28 comes with a choice of a {{convert|1399|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} turbocharged direct injection engine with a power of {{convert|110|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and torque of {{convert|235|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 1,600–4,000 rpm, which can be mated with a six-speed manual transmission or seven-speed Start/Stop enabled [[dual-clutch gearbox]], or a {{convert|1490|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} direct injection engine with a power of {{convert|84|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and torque of {{convert|146|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm mated to a six-speed Start/Stop-capable [[automatic transmission]]. Both engines come from the new [[GM Small Gasoline Engine]] family. Weight reduction of 10% is achieved by using very high-strength steels and aluminum alloys. [[Watt's linkage|Watt's link]] [[torsion beam suspension|torsion beam rear suspension]], first used on the [[Opel Astra]] (J), comes as standard. The car comes equipped with a 4.2" color screen radio or [[MyLink]] 2.0 infotainment system with an 8" screen, and can be configured with [[OnStar]] Gen10 offering 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] Internet connection with a built-in [[Wi-Fi hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/chevrolet/vehicles/cruze/2014.html|title=English|publisher=|access-date=January 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203230919/http://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/chevrolet/vehicles/cruze/2014.html|archive-date=February 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-generation Cruze began sales in North America in early 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/cruze/2016.html|title=Chevrolet Pressroom - United States - Cruze|website=media.gm.com|accessdate=September 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; delayed a year by engineering changes.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-gm-cruze-idUSBRE96G1F720130717|title=Exclusive: GM delays Chevy Cruze debut by a year – sources|date=July 17, 2013|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cruze has a new external design with a new [[Grille (car)|split grille]] front and a [[fastback]]-like sloping roofline from the Chinese version of the [[fastback]]. This second generation Cruze has a slightly longer length and wheelbase than the one designed for the Chinese market, with different styling cues. It is also powered by the 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing {{convert|153|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|177|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} torque.

The 2016 Cruze comes equipped with both Apple [[CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] Capability features. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927225/apple-carplays-coming-to-these-14-chevrolet-cars-in-the-2016-model-year.html "Apple CarPlay's coming to these 14 Chevrolet cars in the 2016 model year"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927293/these-are-the-14-chevrolet-cars-from-the-2016-model-year-that-will-have-android-auto.html "These are the 14 Chevrolet cars from the 2016 model year that will have Android Auto"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Chevrolet unveiled the five-door [[hatchback]] version of the North American Cruze at the [[North American International Auto Show]].  It went on sale in late 2016 as a 2017 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Daniel |date=January 8, 2016 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/36F3CF4D91C13E44CA257F33007855CC |title=Detroit show: Chevrolet Cruze hatch unveiled |work=GoAuto |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Daniel |date=January 8, 2016 |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1101722_2017-chevrolet-cruze-hatchback-revealed-before-detroit-auto-show |title=Detroit show: Chevrolet Cruze hatch unveiled |work=GoAuto |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trim levels continue to be L, LS, LT (now combined into one trim level, as opposed to the previous 1LT and 2LT designations), and Premier (replacing the previous LTZ trim level as the top-of-the-line Cruze trim level). Discontinued are the Eco and Diesel trim levels (at least for the time being).

All trim levels include a seven-inch [[MyLink]] touch-screen infotainment system with A/M-F/M radio, USB integration, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, optional [[SiriusXM]] [[satellite radio]], voice control, and CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities, keyless entry, power windows, power door locks, [[OnStar]] with [[4G]]/[[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]/[[Wi-Fi]] Hotspot connectivity for multiple devices and RemoteLink via an app on the consumer's [[smartphone]], air conditioning, and a 1.4-liter [[EcoTec]] inline-four engine.

Higher trim levels (LT and Premier) also offer features such as the "RS Sport Package", alloy wheels, remote start, keyless access with push-button ignition, a premium sound system by [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] with external amplifier and subwoofer, an eight-inch MyLink infotainment system with GPS navigation, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and power seats. However, only the top-of-the-line Premier trim level offers heated leather seating surfaces, premium alloy wheels, and other luxury features.

The base L only offers a six-speed manual transmission, while the Premier, on the other end of the spectrum, offers only a six-speed automatic transmission. The LS and LT trim levels offer either a six-speed manual transmission, or a six-speed automatic transmission.

A new diesel-powered Cruze will be available in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/cruze/2016.html?id=1446569198908|title=Chevrolet Pressroom – United States – Cruze|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will have the 1.6L turbodiesel also found in the 2018 Equinox, paired to either a nine-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20160802/RETAIL03/160809957/gm-will-take-aim-at-vw-with-diesel-chevy-cruze|title=GM will take aim at VW with diesel Chevy Cruze|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2018 Holden Astra (BL) LS sedan (2018-05-02) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Holden Astra Sedan]]
Before launching the Chevrolet Cruze as the Holden Astra in Australia, Holden engineers performed 100,000 kilometres of suspension and steering testing at the [[General Motors Proving Grounds|Lang Lang Proving Ground]] south east of [[Melbourne, Australia]], tuning for Australian roads. A firmer more compliant ride and more responsive steering tune is the result. Other major changes over the international model included revised front and rear bumpers, which aim to give it a similar look to the [[Opel Astra|Holden Astra Hatch]].&lt;ref name="General Motors"&gt;{{cite web |title=Holden Pressroom – Australia – Astra Sedan |url=http://media.gm.com/media/au/en/holden/vehicles/astra-sedan/2017.html |website=media.gm.com |publisher=General Motors |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |ref=Astra Sedan |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Hatch, the sedan is offered in LS, LS+, LT and LTZ trim levels. All models are powered by a {{convert|1399|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} turbocharged direct injection engine with a power of {{convert|110|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and torque of {{convert|235|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 1,600–4,000 rpm mated to a 6 speed manual or 6-speed automatic.&lt;ref name="General Motors"/&gt;

[[File:2019 Chevrolet Cruze hayon (SIAM 2019).jpg|thumb|right|Hatchback rear three-quarter view]]
For 2019, the Cruze received a mid-cycle facelift, which made its debut in April 2018, along with restyled versions of the 2019 [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]], [[Chevrolet Spark|Spark]] and [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]]. Changes for the Cruze for 2019 include the addition of a lower-priced LS model for the Cruze Hatchback, the deletion of the six-speed manual transmission option (all Cruze models, including the previous manual-only L, will come equipped with an automatic transmission), all-new third-generation [[MyLink]] Systems, and a revised RS Package for LT and Premier models. The 2019 Cruze went on sale in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/cruze/2019.html|title=Chevrolet Cruze/Cruze Hatchback - 2019|website=media.gm.com|accessdate=September 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM turned down an offer from Cleveland automotive dealer owner Bernie Moreno to keep the plant open and continue building the Cruze under a five-year deal, which he hoped would be used to launch a ridesharing service featuring a fleet of Cruzes with two shifts under Moreno's direction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vindy.com/news/2019/mar/17/did-gm-nix-huge-deal-for-cruzes/ "Did GM nix huge deal for Cruzes?"] from ''[[The Vindicator]]'' ([[Youngstown, Ohio]]) (March 18, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

Production in China ended in February 2020, following stronger sales of the [[Chevrolet Monza (China)|Chevrolet Monza]] in that market.&lt;ref&gt;https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/02/gm-ends-production-of-the-chevrolet-cruze-in-china/&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves Argentina as the sole remaining producer of the Cruze, for the Latin American market.

Unlike its Chevrolet predecessors for the U.S. market—Cavalier, Prizm, and Cobalt—or its Daewoo predecessors for the South Korean market—Espero, Nexia, Nubira, and Lacetti—the Cruze has been discontinued without any announcement or plans for a replacement.

[[File:Chevrolet trio 2011 WTCC Race of Japan (Race 2).jpg|thumb|right|The three works Chevrolet Cruze touring cars competing in the [[2011 World Touring Car Championship]]]]
The Chevrolet Cruze first entered the [[World Touring Car Championship]] in [[2009 World Touring Car Championship season|2009]] with a 2.0-litre naturally aspirated engine, taking six wins in its debut season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/wtcc-2011-chevrolet-cruze-1-6-turbo/28878 |title=WTCC 2011 Chevrolet Cruze 1.6 turbo |publisher=AutomobileReviews.com |date=March 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car has proved successful since its entry, with [[Yvan Muller]] winning the championship in [[2010 World Touring Car Championship season|2010]] and again in [[2011 World Touring Car Championship season|2011]] using the new 1.6-litre turbocharged engine. Chevrolet placed first, second and third in 2011, with Muller finishing ahead of teammates [[Rob Huff]] and [[Alain Menu]]. Chevrolet finished 1–2–3 again in [[2012 World Touring Car Championship season|2012]], this time, Huff becoming champion ahead of Menu and Muller.

The Cruze also entered the [[British Touring Car Championship]] for 2010 and 2011. [[Jason Plato]] won the championship for Chevrolet in [[2010 British Touring Car Championship season|2010]] and finished 3rd in [[2011 British Touring Car Championship season|2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/chevrolet-cruze-to-enter-2010-btcc-18387.html|title=Chevrolet Cruze to Enter 2010 BTCC|first=Alina|last=Dumitrache|date=March 23, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTCC Cruze used the 2.0-liter naturally aspirated engine found in the original variant of the WTCC Cruze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chevroletbtcc.co.uk/cars|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115112530/http://www.chevroletbtcc.co.uk/cars/|url-status=dead|title=3 Chevrolet car models you won't be willing to bet on a race &amp;#124; Chevrolet BTCC|archivedate=November 15, 2011|website=chevroletbtcc.co.uk|accessdate=September 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cruze won the [[Scandinavian Touring Car Championship]] in [[2011 Scandinavian Touring Car Championship season|2011]], being run by [[NIKA Racing]] under the banner of 'Chevrolet Motorsport Sweden' with [[Rickard Rydell]] driving. Rydell and teammate [[Michel Nykjær]] finished second and third in [[2012 Scandinavian Touring Car Championship season|2012]].

Chevrolet pulled their sponsorship at the end of 2011 from the BTCC to support the Chevrolet team in the World Touring Car Championship for 2012.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Chevrolet then announced they would not enter a works team for the [[2013 World Touring Car Championship season|2013 WTCC]] season. For 2013 [[RML Group|RML]], the original builders of the Cruzes, continued to compete without the support of Chevrolet. Cars were also entered by [[Bamboo Engineering]], [[NIKA Racing]] and [[Pepe Oriola|Tuenti Racing Team]]. Despite no funding from the manufacturer, the Cruze remained the car to beat, even against works teams from [[Honda]] and [[Lada]]. Muller won his fourth WTCC title, his third in a Cruze and [[James Nash (racing driver)|James Nash]] won the Yokohama Drivers' Trophy for independent entries, ahead of fellow Cruze drivers [[Alex MacDowall]] and [[Michel Nykjær]].

RML have confirmed they will build Cruzes to the new set of WTCC regulations for [[2014 World Touring Car Championship season|2014]], which sees the cars increase in power and feature greater aerodynamics. RML aim to build up to six cars. Confirmed recipients include [[Tom Chilton]] who has yet to announce a team to run his car, [[Bamboo Engineering]] who will run two cars and [[Campos Racing]] who will enter a car for [[Hugo Valente]].

The Cruze returned to the BTCC in [[2013 British Touring Car Championship season|2013]] in the hands of [[Joe Girling]] and [[Tech-Speed Motorsport]], who loaned the car from [[Finesse Motorsport]]. The increase in performance of the [[Next Generation Touring Car]] entries meant the older [[Super 2000]] specification cars like the Cruze were now too uncompetitive to compete for wins but were provided with their own category. Now running a 2.0-litre turbocharged NGTC-specification engine, Girling took one class win at [[Donington Park]] but missed the second half of the season. The car returned to Finesse Motorsport who entered the [[Knockhill Racing Circuit|Knockhill]] round of the championship with [[Aiden Moffat]] driving. At sixteen years old, Moffat became the BTCC's youngest driver at 16 years, 10 months and 28 days. This was to be the S2000 Cruze's final appearance in the BTCC, as S2000 cars are to be abolished from [[2014 British Touring Car Championship season|2014]]. [[Andy Neate]] entered the 2013 season with a new NGTC-specification Cruze, built by his own team, IP Tech Race Engineering and used an engine built by RML. The car made its debut at [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] and competed at several rounds towards the end of the season. The car has since been sold to Aiden Moffat, who will run the car with his own team for 2014. [[BTC Racing]] will enter a hatchback variant of the Cruze for 2014, driven by [[Chris Stockton]]. The car was originally intended to be used by Jason Plato in 2012 but RML and Chevrolet withdrew from the BTCC and mothballed the shell. BTC Racing acquired it and were initially included on the entry list for 2013 but the car was not finished in time and never appeared all season.

The first-generation Chevrolet Cruze debuted in the Argentine [[TC 2000]] in 2011, and the second-generation in 2016. [[Agustín Canapino]] won the 2016 championship.

The '''Chevrolet K5 Blazer''' is a [[full-size]] [[sport-utility vehicle]] that was built by [[General Motors]]. GM's smallest full-size SUV, it is part of the [[Chevrolet C/K]] truck family. Introduced to the [[Chevrolet]] line for the 1969 [[model year]], the K5 Blazer was replaced for 1995 by the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]. In 1970, [[GMC Truck|GMC]] introduced its own model of the truck, called the '''Jimmy''', which was discontinued in 1991 and replaced by the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Yukon]]. The "Jimmy" name was chosen to reflect how '''GM''' may sound in a similar manner to how ''[[Jeep]]'' was thought to be a pronunciation of GP in the competing market.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Both were short-[[wheelbase]] trucks and available with either rear- or [[four-wheel drive]].

The K5 Blazer and Jimmy had "full convertible" removable tops until 1975. For 1976, GM introduced a half-cab design that was less prone to leaks and slightly safer in a roll-over. These half cabs had the convertible top begin a few inches behind the driver/passenger doors and run back to the tailgate.

The Blazer's long-wheelbase relative, with an integrated rear body and doors for 2nd row passengers, is the [[Chevrolet Suburban]].

[[File:'70 GMC Jimmy (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '11).jpg|thumb|left|1970 GMC Jimmy]]
The original K5 was a short wheelbase [[truck]]. It was available in 1969 model year as four-wheel drive only; for 1970, a two-wheel drive model was offered. There were four choices for power plants: the ''[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|250]]'' [[straight-6]], the ''[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#292|292]]'' [[straight-6]], the ''[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#307|307]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]], and the ''[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|350]]'' V8.

The Blazer was designed and marketed to compete with [[International Harvester Scout]] and the [[Ford Bronco]]. Both of these were originally aimed at the short [[Jeep CJ]] series, which were much smaller than other trucks. The innovation of the Blazer was to simply offer a shortened pickup truck, which both increased interior space, and lowered the cost of production with a shared platform. The Blazer quickly became popular. For the first time, it married the off-road capabilities of the Scout with the "luxury" features like air conditioning and automatic transmissions routinely available on pickup trucks. By 1970, the Blazer was already outselling both of its older rivals. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Dodge]], and even Jeep would counter with similar shortened pickups, with the [[Dodge Ramcharger]] and [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]]. It also came as a convertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Convertible_Top/1969%20Chevy%20Blazer%20Convertible%20Top-01.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Convertible_Top |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-wheel drive version came with independent front suspension and rear trailing arms, both with coil springs. The four-wheel drive version had a solid front axle and used [[leaf spring]]s front and rear. Both versions used drum brakes at all four corners until 1971, when the entire GM light truck line got standard front discs. A tachometer was optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1971%20Chevy%20Blazer-06.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a choice between a three-speed [[automatic transmission]] Turbo Hydromatic (TH350), a three-speed [[manual transmission]], and a four-speed Synchromesh (SM465) manual transmission, often referred to as the "granny gear" due to its 6.55:1 low first gear. Two transfer cases were offered: the [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 20, available only with the manual transmissions, or the [[NP-205]], available with both types of transmissions. The Blazer had {{Convert|8|in|mm}} of ground clearance and an approach angle of 35°.&lt;ref name="oldcarbrochures1969"/&gt;

In October 2019, a customized version of the first generation K5 Blazer was made using the entire body of a 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe was circulated throughout the social media world ahead of a scheduled display at the 2019 SEMA Show, and in honor of Blazer’s 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thedrive.com/news/30480/this-chevrolet-tahoe-and-k5-blazer-retro-mashup-will-make-your-brain-hurt “2018 Chevrolet Tahoe and K5 Blazer Retro Mashup Will Make Your Brain Hurt”] from The Drive (October 17, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1973, GM's line of full-size trucks was redesigned and updated. A tilt-steering wheel became optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1973%20Chevrolet%20Blazer-07.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[rear-wheel drive]] Blazers were manufactured until 1982, the majority sold were [[four-wheel drive]].

Until 1975, the K5 had a removable convertible top. In 1976, a half-cab design was introduced and used until 1991.&lt;ref name='specs-76'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloradok5.com/specs.shtml#1976|title=Chevy Blazer specifications|work=ColoradoK5.com|publisher=Performance Media Group, Inc|accessdate= 2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=76p4&gt;{{citation|title=Blazer '76 catalog|date=September 1975|page=4|publisher=Chevrolet Motor Division|url=http://www.coloradok5.com/brochures/1976/blazer4.jpg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708175554/http://coloradok5.com/brochures/1976/blazer4.jpg|archivedate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 400|GMT400 platform]] was introduced in the spring of 1987 as a 1988 model, the K5 Blazer, Suburban, and crew-cab trucks retained the earlier platform until 1991. For in late 1988 for 1989 models, the front grille was changed to resemble the squared-off ones used on the GMT400 series of pickups.

The K5 Blazer was fitted with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-six as standard through 1984. Available engines included a {{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-six, small-block V8s of 305, 307, 350, or 400 cubic inches (5.0, 5.0, 5.7, and 6.6 liters), and a 6.2&amp;nbsp;L Detroit Diesel V8.

1973–1980 Blazers used the gear-driven part-time NP-205 transfer case (mostly mated to the SM465 manual transmission and some TH350s) or the chain-driven full-time NP-203 transfer case (mated to the TH350 automatic) and DANA-44 front/12-bolt rear axle combination through 1980. Starting in 1981 used the chain-driven NP208 transfer case (NP241 after 1988) with front 10-bolt/rear 10-bolt axle combinations until 1991. There is an overlap of 12-bolt rears into the early '80s, while the 10-bolt front axle was phased into production in the late 1970s.

The second generation K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate into a single unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.

Since 1981 (in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Arab Oil Embargo]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]]), Chevrolet and GMC used the smaller displacement 305s with a 9.2:1 compression ratio. These engines produced nearly as much torque as the 350, giving a similar driving feel. However, these power plants were underpowered and prone to [[detonation]] ([[engine knocking]]), especially with the electronic spark control module. To achieve the 9.2:1 compression ratio, the cylinder head chambers were smaller, measuring 56&amp;nbsp;cc instead of 76&amp;nbsp;cc.

Around 1976, a prototype K5 Blazer &lt;ref&gt;July 1976 FourWheeler magazine&lt;/ref&gt; was used as a testbed for a military [[CUCV]] vehicle built by Vic Hickey, father of the HUMVEE. Between 1983 and 1987, what is known as the M1009 [[CUCV]] was the production militarized version of the civilian K5. The differences are the lack of an air conditioner, an additional leaf spring in the suspension, a hybrid 12/24&amp;nbsp;V electrical system (described in detail below), blackout headlights, front mounted brush guard, a rifle rack, and special paint jobs. A majority of them are painted [[olive drab]] green or in the [[M81 Woodland|woodland]] camouflage pattern, though some vehicles that saw desert use were painted tan. All M1009s, including its derivatives, are powered with the 6.2 L Diesel power plant.

The M1009s have a split 24/12&amp;nbsp;V electrical system. Most of the truck actually runs on 12&amp;nbsp;V. It has two separate 12&amp;nbsp;V alternators and batteries wired in series, only the glow plug system, injection pump, the starter, and the jumper cable jack are wired to the 24&amp;nbsp;V terminals. everything else in the truck runs on 12&amp;nbsp;V. The glow plugs are actually 12&amp;nbsp;V glow plugs with a resistor pack on the firewall to drop the 24&amp;nbsp;V down to 12&amp;nbsp;V. This resistor pack can be bypassed and the glow plugs run directly off of the 12&amp;nbsp;V battery. If this is done and the 24&amp;nbsp;V starter is replaced with a standard 12v starter, the second alternator is no longer needed. (If this is done then the military 24&amp;nbsp;V slave adapter in the grille will need to be disconnected as well.)

Some decommissioned M1009s end up in law enforcement use (e.g. with the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]) or sold through government auctions, but a handful are still in use by the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]].

After 1987, when [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|throttle-body injection]] was introduced in the truck engines, the 350 was made the standard power plant.

[[General Motors|GM]] temporarily changed the usual "[[Chevrolet C/K|C/K]]" designation to "R" and "V" for the 1987 through 1991 model years. This was done to avoid confusion with the GMT400-based Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks, which were introduced in 1988, during the overlap period.

In 1988, four new colors were introduced: Bright Blue Metallic, Forest Green Metallic, Light Mesa Brown Metallic, and Dark Mesa Brown Metallic. More new features for 1988 included a fixed mast antenna in place of the old windshield antenna, a trip odometer as part of the gauge package cluster, and an improved pulse windshield wiper control. Also, helping to reduce air leaks in the doors was a new door handle seal.

The 1989 Blazer had new base and up-level grilles, as well as new headlight bezels, body side moldings, and front bumper rub strips. Corporate 10-bolt axles were upgraded to 30 spline axle shafts from previous 28 spline. New for 1989 was the introduction of an all-new base coat/clear coat paint. The standard L05 5.7-liter V-8 now had one serpentine accessory drive belt in place of the older multi-belt accessory drive setup. 1989 was first year for the  241 transfer case and also the only year for speedometer cable driven version of the 241. 

For the 1990 model year, all Blazers now had a standard rear wheel anti-lock braking system. A new electronic speedometer system, with a 6 digit odometer on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990, along with non-asbestos brake linings. A new brake warning light on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990. The Blazer body also used double sided, galvanized exterior sheet metal. A new option for 1990 was power mirrors. The 5.7 liter V8 (L05) engine was improved for 1990 with the addition of improved oil control rings, a redesigned rear crankshaft seal, a new camshaft sprocket design, non-asbestos intake manifold gaskets, and heavy-duty intake valves. 3 point shoulder harness also become standard for rear passengers. The rear seat arm rest were eliminated from rear seat to make room for shoulder belts and pads were added to the wheel housings. 

For 1991, the 700R4 was renamed to the 4L60. The TBI (throttle body injection) system used on the Blazer's standard 5.7 liter V8 had longer throttle shaft bearings, new throttle return springs, and improved fuel mixture distribution.  The 5.7 liter V8 also had new heavy-duty intake valves and powdered metal camshaft sprockets. Standard on all engines was a lighter more powerful 100-amp CS130 alternator. Two new exterior colors, Brilliant Blue and Slate Metallic were offered.

The '''Chevrolet''' and '''GMC B series''' is a series of cowled chassis that were produced by [[General Motors]], primarily fitted with [[school bus]] bodies throughout its production.  Based on the medium-duty (Class 6-7) trucks produced by the Chevrolet and GMC divisions of General Motors, the B series was produced in three separate generations; GMC initially produced its own version separate from Chevrolet.   Introduced in 1966, the B series was redesigned in 1984 and 1992 as a 1993 model.

Following the end of a supply agreement with [[Blue Bird Corporation]], effectively leaving General Motors without a body manufacturer with which to supply chassis, the company exited production of full-size bus chassis, producing the later GMT560 solely as a cutaway-cab vehicle.  The [[Blue Bird Vision]] entered production in 2004, becoming the first conventional-style school bus produced without a second-party chassis.

As of 2017, General Motors remains a supplier of bus chassis for school bus and commercial bus use.  Currently, all examples are [[cutaway van chassis]] based on the GMT610 architecture (Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana).

== Background ==
Prior to 1966, all medium- and heavy-duty trucks of General Motors were derived heavily from the [[Chevrolet C/K|C/K series]] trucks (and the [[Chevrolet Task Force|Task Force]] trucks before them).  Although using a stronger frame and suspension, much of the bodywork was shared.  With the exception of divisionally-produced engines, the Chevrolet and GMC medium-duty trucks were largely identical to one another.  Consequently, the conventional-type school bus chassis used for both divisions were largely the same.

For 1966, GMC ended the use of a shared conventional bus chassis as it debuted its own version derived from its H-series heavy truck line; Chevrolet debuted its own design in 1967, derived from the C/K medium-duty line.  For 1971, both divisions consolidated conventional bus production solely to the C/K chassis.

For 1973, General Motors redesigned the entire C/K truck line, ranging from half-ton pickups to medium-duty trucks.  As Chevrolet and GMC had only adopted the C/K chassis together in 1971, GM would continue the production of the 1967-generation chassis for another decade.  After 16 years as a Chevrolet and 12 years of production as a GMC, the first-generation C/K bus chassis was retired after 1983.

=== Chevrolet (1967–1983)  ===
In 1967, Chevrolet moved the medium-duty C/K to a dedicated chassis, taking the school bus chassis with it.  As with the previous generation, the design was a rear-hinged "alligator"-design hood.  The division offered its conventional school bus chassis with Chevrolet-produced engines, including the 250 inline-6 (replaced by the 292 inline-6), 366 V8, and 427 V8.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/historical-brochures/GMC/100_YR_GMC_HISTORY_MAR09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In both Chevrolet and GMC school buses, the Allison AT475 3-speed automatic transmission became an option in 1971 with single or two-speed rear axles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1974, the powertrain lineup was modified, as all GMC-built engines were dropped (alongside all diesel engines).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1980, a diesel engine made its return as Detroit Diesel introduced an 8.2L  V8.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Dubbed the "Fuel Pincher", it was the first four-stroke engine produced by the company; the engine was available in naturally-aspirated and turbocharged forms.

=== GMC (1966–1970) ===
[[File:GMC H6500 farm bus.jpg|left|thumb|1966-1970 GMC H6500 school bus (retired)]]
In 1966, the GMC division moved its school bus chassis from the medium-duty C/K to the all new H6500 heavy truck. A forerunner of both the [[GMC Brigadier]] and [[GMC General]], the H-series trucks featured an all-steel [[Fascia (car)|front fascia]] with a center-hinged "butterfly" hood for engine access.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Alongside GMC V6 and V8 gasoline engines, GMC school bus chassis were available with Detroit Diesel 6V53 V6 diesels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://67-72chevytrucks.com/vboard/showthread.php?t=514312|title=1966-81 Chevy H/J Series - The 1947 - Present Chevrolet &amp; GMC Truck Message Board Network|website=67-72chevytrucks.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, GMC transitioned its medium-duty trucks to the Chevrolet-based C/K medium-duty chassis introduced in 1967.  The heavy-duty GMC school bus chassis remained in use by the division for 1970, before both divisions consolidated designs for 1971.

While General Motors redesigned its entire light and medium-duty C/K truck line for 1973, Chevrolet and GMC retained the previous-generation cowled bus chassis for nearly another decade.  For 1984, a second generation was introduced, consolidating conventional trucks and cowled bus chassis for the first time.  Codenamed B6, the redesign was again shared by both Chevrolet and GMC, differing only in grille design.  From the drivers' compartment, the B6 chassis shared the steering column with its predecessor (with nearly the same instrument panel).  

In a major design change, the rear-hinged hood was replaced by a standard front-hinged tilting hood, allowing improved engine access.  The 6.0L (366) and 7.0L (427) V8 engines made their return, along with the 8.2L Detroit Diesel "Fuel Pincher" V8.  In 1990, the 8.2L engine was discontinued.    

In 1985, General Motors developed a modified version of the B series for [[Ward Body Works]] as a chassis for the Ward Patriot school bus.  To allow for a shortened hood (to improve driver visibility), the front chassis of the C/K conventional was shortened for a configuration similar to that of the smaller Chevrolet/GMC P-chassis.  The "semi-forward control" design would be developed further by GM with the [[Thomas Vista]], another bus that would use a GM B-series chassis during its production.

For 1990, General Motors introduced its GMT530 medium-duty truck platform as the [[Chevrolet Kodiak|Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick]], replacing the previous trucks of that nameplate, the GMC Brigadier, and the medium-duty C/K product lines. B series based on the GMT530 entered production for 1992, as a 93 model year. As with its predecessor, the chassis was shared between Chevrolet and GMC, with only the grill differentiating the two.

The GMT530 B series was powered by a range of gasoline and diesel engines.  As gasoline engines were being phased out of school buses during the 1990s, the B series became the last full-size school bus to offer them, with a 6.0L (366 cubic inch) V8 as standard.  As the Kodiak/TopKick was renamed the C series in 1997, the 6.0L V8 was eventually phased out in favor of the Vortec 7.4L V8; the 7.4L V8 was replaced by an 8.1L Vortec V8 (one of the largest gasoline engines ever used in a school bus) in 2001.  The Caterpillar 3116 was the first diesel engine option, joined by the turbocharged [[Caterpillar 3126]] in 1997.  Along with Allison automatic transmissions, the GMT530 B series was available with either 5- or 6-speed manual transmissions.

The last manufacturer to offer a gasoline engine in a conventional-chassis school bus (prior to its reintroduction in 2016 in the Blue Bird Vision), a number of GM gasoline school buses were converted to use alternative fuels, including LPG (propane) and CNG (compressed natural gas).  When GM replaced the GMT 530 series of medium duty conventionals with the GMT 560 series in 2003, no direct replacement for the B series was offered.  However, the GMT560 would see use for bus builders with [[Cutaway van chassis|cutaway cab]] buses in many forms, alongside those based on the [[Freightliner Business Class M2|Freightliner M2]] and [[Ford F-650|Ford F-650 Super Duty]].

===Blue Bird CV200===
Prior to 1992, the B-series chassis was available to any school bus manufacturer.  That year, GM and [[Blue Bird Corporation|Blue Bird]] signed a supply and marketing agreement, with the latter company becoming the exclusive supplier of the then-new GMT530 bus chassis for the next 10 years.  The resulting model was named the CV200; while the GM B-7 (internal name for the GMT530-based bus chassis) was standard, [[Navistar International]] and [[Ford]] (later, [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]]) chassis were available as options.

Along with the 1991 Navistar acquisition of [[AmTran]], the agreement was a part of a series of mergers and acquisitions in the school bus industry between body manufacturers and chassis suppliers, eventually crippling the market share of General Motors as a chassis supplier as the agreement was not renewed.  Effectively shut out of the industry as a full-size chassis supplier, General Motors ended chassis production in 2002 (2003 model) to concentrate on cutaway-chassis buses.

==Usage by body manufacturers==
While used nearly exclusively for school bus use, the B-series chassis was adapted for a wide variety of uses by body manufacturers, ranging from bookmobiles to police buses.  In the school bus industry, the General Motors chassis was popular for its wide range of engines.  During the 1980s and 1990s, its continued use of gasoline engines remained popular, as the powerplants were sometimes used as the basis for conversion to alternative fuels, including LPG (propane) and CNG (compressed natural gas).

Following the chassis and supply agreement between General Motors and Blue Bird in 1992, the B series was bodied exclusively by that company, nearly exclusively as a school bus.

The '''Chevrolet Tahoe''' (and its rebadged version, the '''GMC Yukon''') is a full-size SUV from [[General Motors]]. [[Chevrolet]] and [[GMC (General Motors division)|GMC]] sold two different-sized SUVs under their [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer/Jimmy]] model names through the early 1990s. This situation changed when GMC rebadged the full-size Jimmy as the Yukon in 1991. [[Chevrolet]] waited until 1994 to rebadge the redesigned mid-size [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|S-10 Blazer]] as the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], renaming the full-size Blazer as the Tahoe. The name Tahoe refers to the rugged and scenic area surrounding [[Lake Tahoe]] in the western United States. The name Yukon refers to the  [[Yukon]] territory of northern [[Canada]]. For the 1995 model year, the Tahoe and Yukon gained a new 4-door model slotting in size between the 2-door models and the longer wheelbase and higher passenger capacity to up to nine passengers like the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and newly named Yukon XL.

The Tahoe is sold in North America, Parts of Asia such as the Middle East, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Philippines, plus other countries including Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Angola and Russia as a left-hand drive vehicle. The Yukon is only sold in North America and the Middle East.

The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon currently serve as a part of General Motors' full-size SUV family. Lengthened wheelbase models are available for both as the [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]] for Chevrolet and [[Chevrolet Suburban|Yukon XL]] for GMC. A luxury Denali model joined the Yukon lineup in 1998 for the 1999 model year. As of 2001, a [[GMC Denali|Denali]] version of the Yukon XL has also been available as the Yukon XL Denali. The Cadillac Escalade is closely related to the Denali models of the Yukon. As of February 2014, the 2014 Tahoe was the top-ranked Affordable Large SUV in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''{{-'}}s rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/Affordable-Large-SUVs/|title=Best Affordable Large SUVs Rankings - U.S. News Best Cars|work=rankingsandreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tahoe's main competition comes from the [[Ford Expedition]], but it also competes with the [[Toyota Sequoia]] and [[Nissan Armada]].

The Tahoe has regularly been the best selling full-size SUV in the [[United States]], frequently outselling its competition by 2 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2018/01/large-suv-sales-america-december-2017/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new GMC Yukon was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, while Chevrolet continued to use the K5 Blazer name through 1994. All were 2-door models through 1994. The Chevrolet K5 Blazer was discontinued after the 1994 model year. The Chevrolet Tahoe was introduced in 1995 for the 1995 model year with the addition of an all-new 4-door version. The Tahoe was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] for 1996. It is named for [[Lake Tahoe]] on the California-Nevada border in the United States.

The Tahoe/Yukon were shorter than the [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]] on which they were based, but shared that vehicle's ''[[GMT400]]'' [[automobile platform|platform]]. This was a true truck chassis, and was based on that used in the [[Chevrolet Silverado]] full-size [[pickup truck]]. Both two-door and four-door models were produced in [[rear-wheel drive|rear-]] and [[four-wheel drive]].
The two-door weighs roughly {{convert|4500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} while the four-door weighs approximately {{convert|5500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.  The two-door rode a six-inch shorter wheelbase than the four-door.
"AutoTrac" full-time all-wheel drive and a programmable Homelink transmitter were added for 1998. The upscale '''Denali''' trim line to the Yukon was introduced in 1999 as these vehicles became popular with wealthy families.

The standard engine was Chevrolet's {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Chevrolet 350|LO5]] small-block V8, while a turbocharged {{convert|395|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|Detroit Diesel]] V8 was available beginning in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.media.gm.com/division/chevrolet/products/archive_prod_info/pguide/tahoe/tahbkgnd.htm |title=1996 Tahoe - History |work=GM Media Archives |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mexico]], the Tahoe 2-door was released in 1995, called the Chevrolet Silverado, and in 1998 the 4-door was released as the Silverado 4-door, and both were available in Base, LS, and luxury LT trim lines.
In [[Venezuela]], the Tahoe 2-door was released in 1993 (4WD only), called the Chevrolet Grand Blazer, and in 1996 the 4-door was released as the Grand Blazer 4-door (2WD). In 1996 the 2-door was discontinued. In 1996 only Grand Blazer 4-door 4WD was available. 
In [[Bolivia]], 1995 the 4-door was released as the Tahoe 4-door (4WD). The Chevrolet Tahoe is playfully referred to as a 'hoe'. It is often stated that men can have a wife and a 'hoe'. This name came about due to the overwhelming cost of upkeep on this vehicle after lifting it and putting it on big tires.

Beginning in 1994, GM began making numerous annual changes to the Blazer/Yukon, including:
* Revised front clip - Blazer (1994)
* Revised interior including a driver-side [[air bag]], revised side mirrors, Blazer renamed Tahoe, 4-door option included (1995)
* Revised ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|Vortec]] 5700'' (350 cu in) engine with increased [[power (physics)|power]] and [[fuel efficiency]], electronic 4WD shifting, [[daytime running lights]], illuminated entry, and some new interior features (1996)
* Revised front clip - Silverado Mexican market (1996)
* Revised automatic transmission, new EVO (electronic variable orifice) speed-sensitive power steering system and added passenger-side airbag, Yukon 2-door option dropped (1997)
* Programmable Homelink transmitter, PassLock security system, heated front seating surfaces optional, air conditioning for rear seat passengers, AutoTrac automatic 4WD option added, second-generation airbags, transmissions revised again (1998)
* Tahoe 2-door option dropped (1999)

=== Tahoe Limited and Tahoe Z71 ===
[[File:2000 Chevy Tahoe Limited.jpg|thumb|left|2000 Chevrolet Tahoe Limited]]
When the GMT800 platform based Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon was released for the 2000 model year, a 2WD Tahoe Limited and 4WD Tahoe Z71 remained in production on the GMT400 platform as special edition vehicles. These special edition vehicles were produced in the Arlington, Texas assembly plant for the 2000 model year only.

The '''Chevrolet Tahoe Limited''' was based on the Chevrolet Tahoe SS concept vehicle introduced in 1996 that never made it to production. It is reported that GM disliked the idea of an SS badged vehicle at a time when insurance companies were already demanding higher premiums for SUVs. The Tahoe SS prototype vehicles made in 1996 were painted either an unspecified metallic green or metallic blue, but the Tahoe Limited was produced only in ''Onyx Black''. The Tahoe Limited had a distinctive exterior appearance that included a factory equipped ground effects, a monochromatic theme with bumpers and grille painted in the same high gloss black as the body, removal of the roof rack, and fog lamps integrated into the front bumper. Other notable features of the Tahoe Limited included the Z60 high-performance chassis package (commonly known as the police package) which places the body of the vehicle {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} lower than the 4WD Tahoe, two-tone gray and charcoal leather interior seating surfaces, a {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} gauge cluster, {{convert|46|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein shock absorbers]], a 3.42 or optional 3.73 rear gear ratio, a limited slip rear differential, an engine oil cooling system, and distinctive 16&amp;nbsp;inch [[Ronal]] R36 five-spoke aluminum wheels.

[[File:2000 Chevrolet Tahoe Z-71 Special Edition.jpg|thumb|2000 Chevrolet Tahoe Z-71 Special Edition]]
The '''Chevrolet Tahoe Z71''' also exhibited a monochromatic appearance similar to the Tahoe Limited, but instead of ''Onyx Black'' the Tahoe Z71 was offered in either ''Light Pewter Metallic'', ''Victory Red'', ''Emerald Green Metallic'', or ''Indigo Blue Metallic''. Features of the Tahoe Z71 were similar to those of the Tahoe Limited with a few key differences to distinguish the 2WD Tahoe Limited from the 4WD Tahoe Z71. Features that differ from those previously mentioned on the Tahoe Limited included the Z71 off-road chassis package ({{convert|46|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Bilstein Shock Absorbers|Bilstein shock absorbers]], a standard 3.73 rear gear ratio G80 locking differential), color-keyed wheel flares, trim, grille and bumpers, underbody skid plates, inset driving lights built into the center of the front bumper, oversized two row radiator, two-tone leather seating surfaces in either a gray or neutral theme, distinctive taillamp lens protectors, black tubular side assist step bars, black brush guard, and distinctive 16&amp;nbsp;inch Alcoa five spoke 6 bolt polished aluminum wheels.

The [[L31 (engine)|L31]] 5.7 L Vortec V8 powerplant and 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission shared with other GMT400 Chevrolet Tahoe vehicles were not modified in these special edition vehicles, and as such these special editions were mostly appearance packages, albeit with unique-handling suspension options.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Other than the Tahoe Limited Edition, the vehicle was redesigned and launched in March 2000 for the 2000 [[model year]] on the new ''[[GM GMT platform#GMT 800|GMT800]]'' platform, still shared with the full-sized pickups and SUV's.&lt;ref&gt;http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/gm-engineers-had-extra-year-work-2000-truck-line&lt;/ref&gt; Two new engines replaced the old Chevy 5.7 L (350 cu in) small-block [[V8 engine|V8]], and while both were smaller, both produced more horsepower but less torque. In [[Mexico]], the GMT800 Chevy Tahoe is called the Chevrolet Sonora. A 2-door GMT800 Tahoe prototype was made but never entered production.

Both vehicles received significant updates with only the grille, headlights and body-side moldings distinguishing one from the other. Both vehicles now featured softer lines as part of a more aerodynamic design. The interior was also updated with new seats, dashboard, and door panels.

=== 2000 ===
All-new Tahoe and Yukon are launched. Side-impact airbags are standard for driver and front passenger, [[OnStar]] communications system optional, automatic headlamp control standard, Power-operated sunroof optional for first time, new uplevel 9-speaker audio system with rear mounted subwoofer, Driver Message Center, new PassLock II theft-deterrent system, Autoride Suspension system optional on Tahoe LT and Yukon SLT, all-new independent SLA front suspension with torsion bars and all-new five-link rear suspension with coil springs.

=== 2001 ===
New colors ''Forest Green Metallic'' and ''Redfire Metallic'' are introduced while ''Dark Copper Metallic'' and ''Dark Carmine Red Metallic'' are canceled. Two-tone paint is discontinued, optional Z71 package available on LS 4x4 includes: tube side steps, unique lower molding and wheel flares with extensions, color-keyed grille, bumpers, door handles and mirrors, unique front foglamps, unique luggage carrier with rear roller (roof rack), specifically tuned shock absorbers, 17-inch wheels, P265/70R17 all-terrain tires and [[OnStar]]. 40/20/40 bench seat gets revised cupholder design, Tan/Neutral replaces Light Oak/Medium Oak interior trim. [[Onstar]] is now optional on Tahoe LS.

=== 2002 ===
Tahoe LS receives a plethora of new standard features, including: six-way power adjustable seats, heated exterior mirrors with drivers-side auto-dimming feature, electric rear-window defogger and HomeLink Universal Transmitter. Base trim is discontinued. Vortec 5300 V8 is now flex-fuel [[Ethanol fuel|E85]] capable. Tahoe LT models ordered in ''Redfire Metallic'' now come with body-color front bumper cap, bodyside moldings and wheel flares. Premium ride suspension is made standard on all models (excluding Z71).

=== 2003 ===
GM's full-size SUVs saw a major refresh for the 2003 model year. New features include: StabiliTrak stability enhancement system, dual-level airbags, passenger-sensing system, adjustable brake and accelerator pedals with memory. New radio systems with Radio Data System (RDS), custom designed [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] audio system available on models with front bucket seats, [[XM Satellite Radio]], and [[Panasonic]] rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Tri-Zone climate control with manual controls standard on LS and Z71, automatic controls standard on LT. Second-row bucket seats optional on models with leather seating surfaces. LT models feature power-adjustable, body-color exterior mirrors with power folding, memory and integrated turn signal indicators.

2003 Tahoe's provided early compliance to the 2005 LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) federal safety standards. A redesigned instrument cluster featured a new Driver Information Center, which can monitor and report on up to 34 different vehicle system functions including: Service StabiliTrak, Ice Possible and Door Ajar. The interior was refreshed, including a new eight-button steering wheel that allows the driver to safely access new infotainment features as well as a redesigned center console.

There were also new improvements to the powertrain and electrical system for 2003. These included a new Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) system to improve throttle feel and new oxygen sensors to improve durability and reduce emissions during engine warm-up. Models sold in [[California]] received a more robust catalytic-converter to meet Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) standards. A new battery-rundown protection system automatically turns off the headlamps, parking lamps, and interior lighting if left on for more than 10 minutes with the key removed from the ignition.

New colors for 2003 include ''Sandalwood Metallic'' and ''Dark Spiral Gray Metallic''.

=== 2004 ===
The Tahoe received minor updates for 2004, most notably newly designed 16 and 17-inch wheel choices and a tire pressure monitoring system. Hydroboost brakes and a front passenger seat belt reminder were also added as was a 7-to-4 pin trailer brake wiring adapter. 2004 was the final year Tahoe could be ordered with rear barn doors.

The 5.3L Vortec 5300 V8 is now rated at {{convert|295|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|335|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.

New colors for 2004 were ''Dark Blue Metallic'', ''Silver Birch Metallic'', and ''Sport Red Metallic''.

[[OnStar]] is now standard on all trims. Touch-screen navigation system now optional. 160-amp alternator, new interior trim, and redesigned aerodynamic side-sill assist steps to improve efficiency. All Tahoes come standard with a rear liftgate and liftglass.

A new all-electric cooling system helps with quiet operation as well as fuel efficiency. New aerodynamic changes, including a new front air deflector, help the Tahoe improve fuel efficiency by one MPG.

The 4.8L Vortec 4800 V8 is now rated at {{convert|285|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.

New colors include ''Sandstone Metallic'' and ''Bermuda Blue Metallic''.

=== 2006 === 
2006 marked the final year of the Tahoe and Yukon on the [[GMT800]] platform and because of this only minor changes were made. These changes included combining the [[OnStar]] and [[XM Satellite Radio]] antennas into one single unit, removal of the Chevrolet badging on the liftgate, relocating the catalytic converter closer to the engine to improve emissions performance and a new manual parking brake adjuster.

The flex-fuel capable Vortec 5300 V8 is now available on all retail packages.

General Motors redesigned the Tahoe and Yukon on the new ''[[GM GMT platform#GMT 900|GMT900]]'' platform in late 2005 as a 2007 model. A hybrid version of the Tahoe/Yukon, which uses the shared GM/[[Chrysler]] [[Advanced Hybrid System 2]], followed with the 2008 models. The GMT900 based Tahoe and Yukon exceeded initial sales expectations and continued to sell well despite a weakening market for large SUVs. The short-wheelbase Tahoe and its police counterpart began production at [[Arlington Assembly]] on December 1, 2005. SWB Yukon production began in early 2006, with [[Janesville Assembly]] coming online as well. For the first time, GM used the Tahoe name in [[Mexico]].

For 2007, the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe received different front fascias, hood, and tail lights. The GMC Yukon boasted a monolithic grille and headlights, while the Chevrolet Tahoe grille was divided by a body-colored bar similar to the chrome bar found on the [[GMT800]] Tahoe. Both the redesigned Yukon and Tahoe featured a more angular design that gave the vehicles a more upscale appearance than their predecessors. The interior was significantly redesigned as well, features a faux wood trim dashboard with chrome-accented instrument controls. New door panels, as well as new seats, were also added to the interior it still retains its nine-passenger seating availability on LS and SLE models only like the Chevy Suburban and GMC Yukon XL.

Highway mileage was improved from {{convert|19|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|21|to|22|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} with the addition of [[Active Fuel Management]] cylinder deactivation. For 2009, the 6.2&amp;nbsp;L engine in the Yukon Denali got a power increase to {{convert|403|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while a {{convert|395|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 6.2&amp;nbsp;L was added as an option for the Tahoe LTZ. A 6-speed [[GM 6L80 transmission|6L80]] automatic transmission replaced the 4-speed on all trucks except 2WD models with the 4.8&amp;nbsp;L engine. The 2011 model has a [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] [[Vehicle rollover|rollover]] risk of 24.6%,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=229 2011 Chevrolet Tahoe]" ''[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'' (click Rollover)&lt;/ref&gt; and a lateral [[roadholding]] of 0.79[[g-force|g]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2015-chevrolet-tahoe-ltz-vs-2015-ford-expedition-platinum-final-scoring-performance-data-and-complete-specs-page-4 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe specs][https://web.archive.org/web/20150317172957/http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2015-chevrolet-tahoe-ltz-vs-2015-ford-expedition-platinum-final-scoring-performance-data-and-complete-specs-page-4 Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

2008  Offered Hybrid 2mode with two trim levels HY1 or HY2 {{convert|332|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 6.0L Vortec 6000 with a pair of  80-hp, 184&amp;nbsp;ft./lb. torque electric motors.  From 0.36 to 0.34 drag coefficient from  upgraded body panels, 12V/300V battery system. 300V Electric AC, 42V Electric Power Steering, LED Tail Lights this was only an option in 2008-13 and only with the HY1/HY2 trim.

2009 LTZ Models had the option of the {{convert|405|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 6.2L Vortec 6200. This was only an option in 2009 and only in the LTZ trim.

2010 models underwent a mild mid-cycle refresh including a slightly raised bumper, removal of the GM "Mark of Excellence" door badge, revised interior door trim, improved side structure, side torso airbags and optional [[Blind spot monitor|side blind zone alert]].

For 2012, the GMC Yukon offered a special Heritage Edition package, featuring unique Heritage Edition exterior badging, embroidered color-keyed carpeted floor mats, embroidered headrests, SLT-2 Equipment Group standard features (such as 10-way memory leather seats and power liftgate), and optional 20-inch wheels. The Heritage Edition added $1,970 to the price of the Yukon and Yukon XL and was offered in three colors, ''Heritage Blue'', ''White Diamond Tricoat'' and ''Onyx Black''.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gmc/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Mar/0330_gmc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Apprentice'' make-your-own-ad contest ===
In 2006, the 2007 Tahoe was featured on and promoted through [[Donald Trump]]'s TV series, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', where the two teams put together a show for the top General Motors employees to learn about the new Tahoe. Also, ''The Apprentice'' sponsored a controversial online contest in which anyone could create a 30-second commercial for the new Tahoe by entering text captions into the provided video clips; the winner's ad would air on national television. An early example of [[User generated marketing|user-generated marketing]], headed by ad agency [[Campbell Ewald]], the campaign began to backfire when hundreds of environmentally conscious parodies flooded YouTube and Chevy's website critiquing the vehicle for its low gas mileage. Over 400 negative ads were created in total; however, over 20,000 positive ads were created which Chevrolet viewed as successful,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabuyerplanner.com/2006/04/04/despite_negative_ads_chevy/ Despite Negative Ads, Chevy Declares Viral Video Campaign a Success], Media Buyer Planner, 2006-04-04&lt;/ref&gt; despite the negative media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.12/tahoe.html Commercial Break], from Wired News, 2006-12-04&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chevrolet Tahoe, [[Chevrolet Suburban]], [[GMC Yukon]], [[GMC Yukon XL]], [[Cadillac Escalade]], and [[Cadillac Escalade ESV]] had a shortened 2014 model year starting in June 2013, and was replaced with a new version in February 2014 as a 2015 model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/12/2015-chevy-tahoe-suburban-gmc-yukon-unveiled/ "2015 Chevy Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon unveiled"] from Autoblog (September 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tahoe and Yukon are built on the [[GMT K2XX]] platform and assigned as K2UC (for Chevrolet Tahoe) and K2UG (for GMC Yukon). Production on the Tahoe and Yukon began in December 2013 with the first completed SUVs being used for testing purposes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/business/autos-latest-news/20131202-gm-arlington-plant-prepares-for-big-suv-launch.ece "GM Arlington Plant Prepares For Big SUV Launch"] from [[Dallas Morning News]] (December 2, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and started officially shipping the vehicles to dealerships on February 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2014/02/general-motors-arlington-plant-begins-shipping-2015-full-size-suvs.html/ "General Motors Arlington plant begins shipping 2015 full-size SUVs"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807133601/http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2014/02/general-motors-arlington-plant-begins-shipping-2015-full-size-suvs.html/ |date=2016-08-07 }} from ''Dallas Morning News'' (February 7, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Tahoe was later named the fastest-selling vehicle for February 2014, averaging seven days of sales upon its release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2014/03/februarys-fastest-and-slowest-selling-cars.html "February's Fastest- and Slowest-Selling Cars"] from Kicking Tires/Cars.com (March 3, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; 
On September 12, 2013, GM released photos and press release of the fourth-generation Tahoe and Yukon. Like its larger siblings Suburban and Yukon XL, the front fascias of the Tahoe and Yukon are distinct, but from the base of the A-pillars back, they share most of the same styling cues. This now includes inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics and fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels now are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight. A more-efficient, direct-injected EcoTec3 powertrain coupled with improved aerodynamics help increase fuel economy for the SUVs. Both fourth-generation SUVs do not share a single piece of sheetmetal or lighting element with the brands' full-size pick-up trucks, and the front grilles of both vehicles are slightly altered to give them their own identity. The front headlights features projector-beam headlamps that flanks the Chevrolet-signature dual-port grille – chrome on all models, sweeping into the front fenders, while the LTZ trims feature high-intensity discharge headlamps and light-emitting diode daytime running lamps.

Also new are the addition of fold-flat second- and third-row seats, now a standard feature but can be equipped with an optional power-folding feature for the upgraded trims, and an additional two inches of leg room for second-row passengers. The third-row fold-flat feature is accomplished using a raised platform that reduces available cargo space behind the third-row seats.  Standard third-row seats and raised "fold-flat" platform significantly reduce available cargo space compared with previous Tahoe models. Multiple USB ports and power outlets are now spread throughout their interiors, including one 110-volt, three-prong outlet, with the Tahoe adding an available eight-inch color touch-screen radio with next-generation MyLink connectivity along with an available rear-seat entertainment system (but will not feature a Blu-ray option that is exclusive to the Suburban for 2015), while the Yukon added a standard eight-inch-diagonal color touch screen radio with enhanced IntelliLink and available navigation.

The Yukon interior has more features including seats stuffed with dual-firmness foam, a standard Bose sound system and SD card slots, and laminated glass for the windshield and front windows, decreasing interior noise. GM's third-generation magnetic ride control suspension is optional on the Tahoe LTZ models, whose upgraded features include third-generation magnetic ride control, a real-time damping system that delivers more precise body motion control by "reading" the road every millisecond, and changing damping in just five milliseconds.

The new platform is based on the 2014 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500. Both SUVs feature sound deadening material to improve cabin quietness. A new [[Cadillac Escalade]] and [[Cadillac Escalade ESV]] arrived in dealerships in April 2014. Models continued for the Tahoe and Suburban as '''LS''', '''LT''', and '''LTZ''', and the Yukon and Yukon XL as '''SLE''', '''SLT''', and '''Denali'''. The Tahoe and Yukon went on sale in February 2014 as an early 2015 [[model year]] vehicle. Prices for the all-new [[General Motors|GM]] SUVs are expected to stay the same as the current-generation [[GMT900]] SUVs. The Tahoe Hybrid, Yukon Hybrid, and Yukon Denali Hybrid models were dropped along with their powertrains, as well as the [[Cadillac Escalade]] Hybrid and Cadillac Escalade Hybrid Platinum. The Yukon Denali AWD was also dropped as well.

On September 26, 2014, Chevrolet debuted the updated Z71 Tahoe at the State Fair of Texas, along with the debut of the Texas Edition Tahoe, the latter due to Texas having the largest units of Tahoes sold in the United States (as of August 2014, sales of the Chevrolet SUVs in Texas were up 37 percent) and to celebrate the 60th anniversary of GM's Arlington Assembly plant; production began in October 2014. As with the previous Z71 Tahoe, this version will continue to be offered in a 4WD LT trim only, featuring a front skid plate, off-road tires mounted on 18-inch wheels, a unique grille, running boards and "Z71" identification inside and out. Fog lamps, front tow hooks and front parking assist are also included. The Texas Edition will be available in both LT and LTZ trims, featuring a maximum trailering package, twenty-inch polished aluminum wheels (on LT models), twenty-two-inch premium painted aluminum wheels (on LTZ models), and an exclusive "Texas Edition" badge. The Texas Edition Tahoe package will be part of a lineup that will also use the Texas Edition package, alongside the Suburban and Silverado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/09/26/chevy-tahoe-suburban-z71-texas-edition-official/ "Chevy announces Tahoe and Suburban Z71, Texas Editions"] from Autoblog (September 26, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand and interest in the redesigned Tahoe has also translated into a 108 percent sales spike since it went on sale in February 2014, with most dealers reporting the units being sold within 17 days after they arrive on the dealership lots, with most customers opting for the fully optioned LTZ model, making it one of Chevrolet's fastest-selling vehicles in 2014 along with Suburban, who posted higher sales and quicker inventory turnovers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/05/chevrolet-says-demand-for-2015-suburban-and-tahoe-higher-than-expected/ "Chevrolet Says Demand For 2015 Suburban And Tahoe Higher Than Expected"] from GM Authority (May 7, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety recalls ===
On March 23, 2014, a 2015 GMC Yukon caught fire and went up in flames in [[Anaheim, California]], after a couple, who along with the sales representative who were giving them a test drive, noticed the vehicle stopping and that smoke was starting to make its way into the cabin, prompting the three individuals to park the car and escape before it was destroyed within 15 minutes. The cause of the fire was traced to an oil leak and an engine malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gmc-yukon-fire-test-drive-20140324,0,4338091.story#ixzz2wtQzbg9M "GMC Yukon erupts into flames during test drive in Anaheim"] from ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (March 24, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being an isolated incident, the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon are not believed to be tied to GM's announced recall of its vehicles that was made on March 17, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/17/gm-3-recalls-1.7-million-cars-barra-video/ "GM announces 3 new recalls affecting 1.7M vehicles in North America (w/video)"] from Autoblog (March 17, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; But five days later on March 28, 2014, GM announced a recall on the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon in order to fix a “transmission oil cooler line that is not securely seated in its fitting”, causing the vehicle to stop and rupture the oil cooling line, resulting in the engine to malfunction and catching fire immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20140328/BUSINESS0101/303280161/general-motors-gm-recalls-suburban-yukon-cruze "GM recalls another 680,000 trucks, cars, adding to quality woes"] from ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' (March 28, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 2014, GM issued another recall on the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon because their radio control modules may not work, and thus prevent certain audible safety warnings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2014/06/06/gm-issues-4-recalls-90k-vehicles-chevy-buick-gmc/ "GM issues 4 new recalls for 90k vehicles, Chevy, Buick, GMC affected"] from Autoblog.com (June 6, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 mid-year update ===
The Tahoe received 4G LTE, WiFi, and Siri capability, a new color palette, Brownstone Metallic, and added a hands-free power liftgate feature that is standard on LTZ, but included on LT with the optional Luxury Package. The MyLink with Navigation feature became standard on the LTZ trim, while E85 capability is removed from retail orders&lt;ref&gt;but remained available for fleet orders.[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/10/model-year-2015i-chevy-tahoe-suburban-get-a-bevy-of-technology-equipment-updates/ "Model Year 2015i Chevy Tahoe, Suburban Get A Bevy Of Technology &amp; Equipment Updates"] from GM Authority (October 24, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yukon, in addition to receiving the aforementioned features, sees the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine being updated with the new 8L90E eight-speed automatic transmission for the interim model year, allowing it to improve fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/11/gmc-gets-official-with-2015i-technology-equipment-updates-for-yukon-denali-and-denali-xl/ "GMC Gets Official With 2015i Technology &amp; Equipment Updates For Yukon Denali And Denali XL"] from GM Authority (November 6, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A body-colored painted Shark Fin antenna was added with the 2015 mid-year refresh for all models.

=== 2016 ===
For the 2016 model year, the Chevrolet Tahoe received more upgraded changes and new features, similar to the ones added to the Suburban. The changes included power-adjustable pedals, forward collision alert, IntelliBeam headlamps, lane keep assist and a safety alert seat as part of the newly introduced enhanced driver alert package as an available option on the LS trim. The inside floor console with storage area-SD card reader was removed and a new infotainment system was introduced, officially ending the CD player era for the Tahoe; the 8-inch MyLink feature was expanded to the LS trim and became standard (replacing the 4-inch display), although the navigation feature remains as an option on LT and standard on LTZ. A new liftgate shield was added to the Theft Protection Package, along with the new lane keep assist which replaced the lane departure warning. The capless fuel fill tanks became standard on all trims. ''Siren Red Tintcoat'' and ''Iridescent Pearl Tricoat'' became the new color trims, replacing ''Crystal Red Tintcoat'' and ''White Diamond Tricoat''. The instrument cluster was re-configured with a new multi-color enhancement and a heads-up display was introduced as a standard only on the LTZ trim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/tahoe/2016.html "2016 Chevrolet Tahoe"] from GM Media (June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/04/2016-chevrolet-tahoe-receives-new-colors-technology-and-other-conveniences/ "2016 Chevy Tahoe Receives New Colors, Technology And Other Features"] from GM Authority (April 26, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 GMC Yukon also sees similar changes, with liftgate, power, hands-free now packaged on SLT trims, a free-flow feature that replaced the Premium package, and two new premium colors (''Crimson Red Tintcoat'' and ''White Frost Tricoat'') replacing ''Crystal Red Tintcoat'' and ''White Diamond Tricoat'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/vehicles/yukon_xl_denali_xl/2016.html "2016 GMC Yukon XL"] from GM Media (June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/05/2015-gmc-yukon-yukon-xl-get-new-colors-technology-and-more/ "2016 GMC Yukon &amp; Yukon XL Gets New Colors, Technology, and More"] from GM Authority (May 13, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Tahoe came equipped with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto Capability features. However, only one of their phone brands at any one time can be used. The 2014 and 2015 LTZ and Denali packages came equipped with a "wireless" charging accessory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927225/apple-carplays-coming-to-these-14-chevrolet-cars-in-the-2016-model-year.html "Apple CarPlay's coming to these 14 Chevrolet cars in the 2016 model year"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; while the Android Auto option will only be available on LT and LTZ trims featuring 8 inch screens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2927293/these-are-the-14-chevrolet-cars-from-the-2016-model-year-that-will-have-android-auto.html "These are the 14 Chevrolet cars from the 2016 model year that will have Android Auto"] from ''PC World'' (May 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Russian-built Chevrolet Tahoe received the 6.2L V8 L86 EcoTec engine, which was the only engine offered in the region as an exclusive to the Russian and CIS markets only, as GM had no plans to make it available to North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/07/russian-market-chevrolet-tahoe-to-be-powered-by-6-2l-v8-l86-ecotec3-engine/ "Russian Chevy Tahoe To Be Powered By 6.2L V8"] from GM Authority (July 10, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===
For the 2017 model year, Chevrolet made upgraded changes to the Tahoe. New additions include the teen driver feature, the App Store feature, a rear seat reminder, and low speed forward automatic braking. Two new colors, ''Blue Velvet'' and ''Pepperdust Metallic'', were added to replace four colors. The 22-inch wheels option was expanded to three, and the rear seat entertainment system was overhauled. Chevrolet also made changes in the level trims, with the c-pillar badge now removed from LS models and the LTZ trim is renamed to Premier, which will continue to be the top of the line model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/08/2017-chevy-tahoe-updates-changes-new-features-announced/ "2017 Chevy Tahoe Gets New Colors, Wheels &amp; Technology; Active Aero Shutters, Premier Trim &amp; More"] from GM Authority (August 3, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 model year Yukon also received similar changes, but with a few exceptions. Two new colors, ''Dark Blue Sapphire Metallic'' and ''Mineral Metallic'' were introduced, the latter exclusive to the Denali, which is also adding a new 22-inch ultra bright aluminum wheels with midnight silver premium paint and a [[head-up display]] to its features. The interior backlights changed from red to blue. The heated and vented driver and front passenger seats are now standard on the SLT and Denali trims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/08/2017-gmc-yukon-changes-updates-new-colors-new-wheels-front-active-aero-shutters-revamped-rear-seat-entertainment/ |title=2017 GMC Yukon And Yukon XL Get New Colors, Wheels, Front Active Aero Shutters, Revamped Rear Seat Entertainment And More |work=GM Authority |date=August 8, 2016 |access-date=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 ===
For the 2018 model year, the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine will be available in the Tahoe RST (when bought with the Performance Package). All M.Y. 2018 Tahoe and Suburban trim levels will now be standard with LED Daytime Running Lights which will replace the high beam projector DRLs on LS and LT trim levels. The 2018 Tahoe will have the Custom Edition package added as an option on the base LS trim level. The Chevy Tahoe LS trim level will feature a chrome grille, 18" painted aluminum wheels, 18" all season blackwall tires, and third row seat delete (which reduces passenger capacity to 5 seats from 8 seats) if ordered with the Custom Edition package. The GMC Yukon received a 10 speed automatic transmission on the Denali trim level and the GMC Yukon is facelifted for 2018 with a refreshed grille similar to the one from the 2017 [[GMC Acadia]] and 2018 [[GMC Terrain]]. 
{{clear}}

=== 2019 ===
The 2019 model year Tahoe/Yukon will only see minor changes. One exterior color, ''Shadow Gray Metallic'', will replace both ''Havana Metallic'' and ''Tungsten Metallic'', and the Premier model receives a newly redesigned badge on the liftgate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/05/heres-what-new-for-the-2019-chevy-tahoe/ “Here’s What New For The 2019 Chevy Tahoe”] from GM Authority (May 15, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2020 ===
The 2020 model year Tahoe/Yukon will have a short tenure (due to being the final year for the fourth generation) as Chevrolet is deleting the All Season Package and the LT Signature Package, along with the ''Pepperdust Metallic'' exterior color from the Tahoe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/06/2020-chevrolet-tahoe-heres-what-new-and-different/ 2020 Chevrolet Tahoe: Here’s What New And Different] from GM Authority (June 19, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; while the 2020 GMC Yukon replaced its Pepperdust Metallic color with Carbon Black Metallic and made no additional changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/07/2020-gmc-yukon-heres-whats-new-and-different/ "2020 GMC Yukon: Here’s What’s New And Different"] from GM Authority (July 3, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2019, Chevrolet introduced a fifth generation Tahoe at [[Little Caesars Arena]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. This time around, GM chose to introduce the Chevrolet full size SUVs first, with the GMC Yukon debuting in January 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30517344/2021-gmc-yukon-xl-photos-info/|title=New 2021 GMC Yukon, Yukon XL Get AT4 Off-Road Trim and Diesel Engine|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Beresford|first=Colin|date=14 January 2020|accessdate=14 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cadillac Escalade set for February 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/12/next-gen-2021-cadillac-escalade-will-drop-in-february/ "Next-Gen 2021 Cadillac Escalade Will Drop In February"] from GM Authority (December 12, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the Tahoe could be pushed back due to the growing coronavirus pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-autos-launches/coronavirus-could-force-gm-to-delay-its-redesigned-2021-suvs-idUSKBN21H3D8 “Coronavirus could force GM to delay its redesigned 2021 SUVs”] from Reuters (March 30, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tahoe===
Based on the same [[GMT T1XX]] platform as the Silverado 1500, the Tahoe distinguishes itself by swapping that truck's live axle and leaf springs for an independent rear multilink suspension setup with coil springs, thus lowering the floor of the vehicle and creates more room in both the cargo area and the second- and third-row seats. The Tahoe expanded its size length to 210.7 inches, and the wheelbase to 120.9 inches while shortened down by 15 inches longer due to the rear wheelbase moving back by 5 inches, making it the largest SUV in the full size length segment. It gains 11 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row and 10 inches of third-row legroom.

The trims will continue to feature the primary basic LS, LT, and Premier levels, with both Z71 and RST moving from package to premium level, along with the newly added High Country level, the latter being the top of the line, making the Tahoe the only standard full size length SUV to offer the most level trims of any vehicle in this segment.

Quad exhaust tailpipes are added to the vehicle, giving it a more unique look, but this will only be standard on Premier and High Country and available on LT only. The LS, Z71, and RST trims will not have this feature because of their configurations. 

Although it retained a boxy look, it added a more curvy design with this change and adopted the same Chevrolet design language featuring the front grille and LED sinister-like lighting that is also used on the Silverado, save for the black-grilled Z71 (without the bumper) and RST. The tailgate is more front and center, with the signature "Tahoe" name stretched across it. 
 
The dashboard and entertainment system have been fleshed out, moving away from the traditional design. Newly updated features include a 10.25-inch touch screen that is now standard on all trims, and a pair of 12.6-inch LCD rear screens that can play movies and offer content from passengers’ smartphones, and can play different programs on the two screens. A new push button shifter column (P, R, N, D) is placed on the dashboard, nine camera displays for enhanced towing capabilities and a total of 30 additional safety features have been implemented throughout the Tahoe. An Air Ride Adaptive Suspension is standard on the higher trims, likewise with an 8-inch driver screen.

It'll also feature a Duramax diesel engine as an option (available on all trims and packages except for the Z71) for the first time, and so far the only brand outside its competitors to have this option; a 3.0L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] is used which produces 277 horsepower and 460&amp;nbsp;lb-ft of torque. Pending any changes due to the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic that has slowed down production, the fifth generation Tahoe will go on sale in the second quarter of 2020 as a 2021 model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30173547/2021-chevy-suburban-tahoe-photos-info/ "All-New 2021 Chevy Suburban and Tahoe Get Roomier, Add a Diesel"] from Car and Driver (December 10, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are plans to make it available in Left-hand drive regions, GM has been making plans to bring the Tahoe to right-hand drive countries for the first time. Australia and New Zealand are among the key countries expected to be included but held off on the plans, citing [[Holden]]’s brief and unsuccessful tenure to market the Suburban from 1998 to 2001 and its sudden announcement in February 2020 to cease operations. If they do bring the vehicle to the RHD regions, it would carry the Chevrolet badge as part of the “General Motors Specialty Vehicles” exporting sub-brand, as Chevrolet begins a slow expansion back to the Australasian region with an American-built lineup with a local company (expected to be [[Holden Special Vehicles]]) handling the conversions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/01/chevrolet-suburban-tahoe-looking-unlikely-for-australian-arrival/ “Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe Looking Unlikely For Australian Arrival”] from GM Authority (January 22, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whichcar.com.au/news/large-v8-powered-us-suvs-coming-to-australia “Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe put on ice for Australia”] from Whichcar (January 22, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caradvice.com.au/827459/holden-axed-in-australia-as-general-motors-gets-out-of-right-hand-drive-globally/ “Holden Axed In Australia as General Motors Gets Out Of Right Hand Drive Globally”] from Car Advice (February 17, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yukon===
GMC unveiled its fifth generation Yukon in [[Vail, Colorado]] on January 14, 2020, alongside its extended size sibling Yukon XL. Like the Tahoe, the Yukon will also feature an independent rear suspension, a 3.0-liter inline-six turbodiesel engine, and a top-shelf suspension option featuring air springs and magnetic-ride shocks, a standard 5.3-liter V-8, an optional 420-hp 6.2-liter V-8, and a 10-speed automatic transmission that is standard across the lineup. It also gains 4.9 inches in the wheelbase but only 0.4 inch in overall length, making it still short of the Tahoe's length. The dashboard will have two versions, one similar to the Tahoe while a different one with a larger entertainment screen will be exclusive to the Denali. The Yukon's design follows GMC's design language, with the front grille mimicking the Sierra but the tailgate mimicking the GMC crossover SUV lineup with the lights extended to the tailgate doors.

The lineup of level trims also expanded as well, with the SLE, SLT, and Denali now joined by the 4WD-exclusive AT4, the latter of which comes standard with the Magnetic Ride Control electronically adaptive dampers, AT4-exclusive leather-appointed seats and stitching with a unique Jet Black interior color and Brandy accents, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, heated second-row outboard seats, a two-speed transfer case, 20-inch [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] all-terrain tires, Traction Select System with off-road mode, hill descent control, and skid plates.

The fifth generation Yukon will debut in the Summer of 2020 as a 2021 model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motortrend.com/cars/gmc/yukon/2021/2021-gmc-yukon-yukon-xl-first-look-review/ "2021 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL First Look: Breaking Away from Chevy?"] from Motor Trend (January 14, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/14/2021-gmc-yukon-reveal/#slide-endcap "Redesigned 2021 GMC Yukon gets a diesel, AT4 model, Denali-exclusive interior"] from Autoblog (January 14, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

== GMC Yukon Denali ==
{{Further|GMC Denali}}

The [[GMC Denali]] nameplate started as the luxury version of the Yukon for the 1999 model year. The Denali is available on both standard and XL versions and is the top-of-the-line trim in the GMC Yukon lineup.

=== 1999 ===
[[File:1st-GMC-Yukon-Denali.jpg|thumb|right|GMT400 GMC Yukon Denali]]In 1998, at the time of its introduction, the Yukon Denali was GM's answer to the [[Lincoln Navigator]], but then GM introduced a clone to the Yukon Denali and rebadged it "Escalade" under the Cadillac nameplate. The Yukon Denali's exterior was shared with the [[Cadillac Escalade]], with the entire front clip and lower side body panels differing from the standard Yukon. In the interior, in addition, the Denali features luxury options not available in the Yukon. These included an upgraded leather interior, power seats, heated seats front and rear, Bose stereo system, and some woodgrain on the dashboard. The 1999 Yukon Denali and [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]] also saw the first application of GM's [[OnStar]] communications system in a full-size SUV. 
{{clear}}

=== 2001–2006 ===
[[File:GMC Yukon Denali GMT800.jpg|thumb|right|2006 GMC Yukon Denali]]
Even though the Yukon was redesigned alongside the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and Tahoe in 2000, the Denali and [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]] remained on the [[GMT400]] platform. It was not until 2001 that the Denali and Escalade were redesigned. While the [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]] departed from its Yukon based exterior design scheme in attempt to hide its roots, the Yukon Denali's exterior is almost the same as that of a post-2000 model year GMT800 Yukon. Embossed side body panels and slightly reworked headlights with projector-beam lenses along with 17" polished wheels and a unique grille and front bumper differentiate the Yukon Denali from the regular Yukon. 2001 also saw the introduction of the "punch" grille which now has become the hallmark of the Denali nameplate.
{{clear}}

=== 2007–2014 ===
[[File:2011 GMC Yukon Denali Hybrid -- 2011 DC.jpg|thumb|right|2011 GMC Yukon Denali]]
The Yukon Denali was redesigned for the 2007 model year alongside the regular mainstream Yukon. The biggest change was in the styling, such as the flattened tailgate reminiscent of the new Tahoe, and particularly the grill and headlight shapes, which made the Yukon look less aggressive than previous models. The only exterior difference between the Yukon Denali and the standard Yukon are the chrome grille and extensive use of chrome accents; and of course the insignias, embeveled rockerpanels, chromed headlights and the Vortec 6200 engine which it shares with the [[Cadillac Escalade]].

===2015–2020===
[[File:GMC Yukon XL P4250780.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Yukon XL Denali]]

The Yukon Denali was redesigned and updated along with other GM SUVs in September 2013 and went to dealerships on February 5, 2014 as a 2015 model. The Yukon Denali continues with the top-of-the-line features (using the similar features found in the Tahoe LTZ trim) and the front grille honeycomb design, equipped with a new active noise-cancellation technology and GM's third-generation magnetic ride control suspension as a standard feature. In November 2014 The Yukon Denali saw its MSRP bumped up by $1,300 in part due to the loaded features added to its 2015 mid-year updates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2014/11/2015i-gmc-yukon-denali-family-with-8-speed-sees-minor-msrp-bump/ "2015i GMC Yukon Denali Family With 8 Speed Sees Minor MSRP Bump"] from GM Authority (November 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2021-present===

The fifth generation Yukon Denali was introduced in January 2020. The updated and redesigned vehicle will move up in its top of the line level trim due to the introduction of the AT4 that was slotted above the SLT level. It will also have a different dashboard feature that will be exclusive to this trim.

The Tahoe made its hybrid electric debut in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/wireless/content/life/stories/cars/09/29/0929tahoe.html "Full-size hybrids? GM's got 'em"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607165419/http://www.statesman.com/wireless/content/life/stories/cars/09/29/0929tahoe.html |date=2011-06-07 }} from Statesman.com&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, starting price was [[United States dollar|US$]]50,540.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gm.com/shop/vehicle.jsp?year=2008&amp;pvc=11650&amp;pvc=11651 "2008 Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416151731/http://www.gm.com/shop/vehicle.jsp?year=2008&amp;pvc=11650&amp;pvc=11651 |date=2008-04-16 }} from GM.com&lt;/ref&gt; The starting price of the 2009 model was increased to [[United States dollar|US$]]51,405.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prod3.gmautobuilder.com/BuildYourOwn/Chevrolet.byo?year=2009&amp;mmc=CC10706&amp;modelname= "2009 Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918001418/http://prod3.gmautobuilder.com/BuildYourOwn/Chevrolet.byo?year=2009&amp;mmc=CC10706&amp;modelname= |date=2009-09-18 }} from gmautobuilder.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid uses a combination of its dual displacement 3.0/6.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 engine and two {{convert|60|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} (continuous) electric motors with a 300-volt nickel-metal hydride battery. The vehicle can run on either gasoline, electricity or a mixture of the two using automatic [[Two-Mode Hybrid]] system that monitors the vehicle's torque, and state of the battery to choose the most efficient source of power. The battery is charged either directly by generating electricity through driving one or both electric motors using the gasoline engine (while the vehicle is coasting or being driven by the gasoline engine), or by the wheels driving one or both electric motors through what is called "[[Regenerative braking]]" when the vehicle is decelerating, thus regaining some of the energy invested in forward momentum. The Tahoe is considered a strong or full hybrid, in that it can run entirely on the battery (for a limited range) at low speeds. In city driving, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] rating of fuel consumption for the 2WD version of the hybrid is {{convert|21|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}. In comparison, non-hybrid varieties of the Tahoe are rated no higher than {{convert|15|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} in city driving. In highway driving, the EPA rating is {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chevrolet.com/vehicles/2010/tahoehybrid/overview.do |title=2010 Tahoe Hybrid SUV |publisher=Chevrolet.com |accessdate=2010-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412111804/http://www.chevrolet.com/vehicles/2010/tahoehybrid/overview.do |archive-date=2010-04-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tahoe and Yukon Hybrid models were discontinued after the 2013 model year as GM moved to make their SUVs more fuel efficient with the introduction of the EcoTec engine that they would later install in the 2015 Tahoe and Yukon.

== Outside the United States ==
In [[Brazil]] the Tahoe GMT400 was sold under the name of "Grand Blazer", sourced from Argentina with rear-wheel drive only, regionally-sourced 6-cylinder engines (the late-type 4.1 M.P.F.I. Chevrolet straight-6 as the only gasoline-powered option and the 4.2L MWM Sprint 6.07T for those who preferred Diesel) and manual transmission. The GMT400 is used by Brazilian elite police units, such as the BOPE (Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais) in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the ROTA (Rondas Ostensivas Tobias de Aguiar) and GATE (Grupo de Ações Taticas Especiais) in [[São Paulo]]. It is also used by the São Paulo State Police and the [[Rio Grande do Sul]] State Police. But as the cars grew old, the great majority of them were substituted, mainly by the smaller [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] midsize SUV. The Tahoe name was not used in Brazil because it would be unfamiliar to most Brazilians since it refers to the [[Lake Tahoe]] on the border of Nevada and California.
{{clear}}

Another South American country, [[Chile]], has incorporated this vehicle as transport unit for special operations unit ([[GOPE]]) of the Chilean Police ([[Carabineros de Chile]]) to carry communication equipment.

The Tahoe was also assembled in Venezuela from CKD kits for 3 generations, being phased out in 2014 along most of the local Chevrolet range due to unfavorable economic conditions and political circumstances. The 4th generation of the Tahoe has not been available in Venezuela.

In Ecuador, due to fiscal benefits to hybrid vehicles, the 3rd generation of the Tahoe had been offered only in the Hybrid versions until 2011. A review of the benefit to exclude hybrid vehicles with a displacement greater than 1.8L rendered the Tahoe Hybrid less cost-effective than the non-hybrid in Ecuador.

== Police package ==
[[File:Chevrolet-Tahoe-GMT400-police.jpg|thumb|right|GMT800 Chevrolet Tahoe Police package]]

[[File:Hoover Dam, Police Chevrolet Tachoe.jpg|thumb|A Tahoe used for the [[Hoover Dam]] police]]

In [[North America]], the Tahoe is used by many [[law enforcement agencies]], [[Firefighting worldwide|fire departments]], and [[Emergency medical services|EMS agencies]]. Prior to the announcement of the Z56 police package model the civilian base &amp; LS models based on the GMT400 were used in police service. During the 1997 model year, the Tahoe was offered with the Z56 police option using suspension components from the discontinued 454SS truck&amp;nbsp;– the first Tahoe Z56s were available only in 2WD until the GMT400 was phased out. The original prototype had rear disc brakes based on the B-body 9C1s whereas the production Z56s came with rear drum brakes. Plans for outfitting the Tahoe with the Z56 police package originated around the 1994 model year when GM broke news about phasing out its B-platform sedans (Caprice, Impala SS, Roadmaster) at the end of the 1996 model year where a replacement was imminent since GM ended production of its body-on-frame passenger sedans due to SUV sales. Since the introduction of the GMT900, Chevrolet currently offers two versions of the police package Tahoe; a four-wheel-drive version and a two-wheel-drive version. Just like the GMT400 based models civilian GMT800 Tahoe base &amp; LS models were also used for police use until the Z56 police package option was reintroduced in 2004 late in the GMT800's life cycle by some agencies.

Chevrolet refers to the four-wheel drive (4WD) version as "Special Service Vehicle" (SSV) which has the 5W4 code. This version of the Tahoe can be used for all purposes except pursuits and high speed responses due to its high center of gravity just below the front window&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chevrolet.com/content/dam/Chevrolet/northamerica/usa/nscwebsite/en/Home/Ownership/Manuals_and_Videos/02_pdf/2k13tahoepolice.pdf 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe Police and Special Service Packages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193447/http://www.chevrolet.com/content/dam/Chevrolet/northamerica/usa/nscwebsite/en/Home/Ownership/Manuals_and_Videos/02_pdf/2k13tahoepolice.pdf |date=2015-05-03 }} page 9-2&lt;/ref&gt; (height, not location), thus having a higher probability of [[Vehicle rollover|rolling-over]] at high speeds. This version is preferred by agencies where snow, ice, flooding, rough terrain, and ground clearance are common issues.[34]

Chevrolet refers to the two-wheel drive (2WD) version—also known as the rear-wheel drive (RWD) version—as "Police Pursuit Vehicle" (PPV). This version be used for all purposes including pursuits and high speed responses. The center of gravity in this vehicle is lower than that of the four-wheel-drive version and the ground clearance is about 1 in (25&amp;nbsp;mm) less, with a standard rear bumper replacing the tow hitch on civilian Tahoes. Highway patrol agencies prefer the two-wheel-drive version, where pursuits and long distance responses are more common. As of the 2012 model year, the Tahoe was the last body-on-frame, rear-wheel drive police vehicle manufactured for the United States market since Ford phased out its aging Panther platform, the [[Volvo XC90]]-based Ford Police Interceptor (known as the Ford Explorer in civilian trim). Other SUVs like the Ford Expedition are used by many law enforcement and EMS agencies, but are not pursuit rated.[35]

Chevrolet built a 2015 Chevrolet Tahoe Police Patrol Vehicle that was previewed as a concept at the [[SEMA Show#2013|2013 SEMA Show]] in Las Vegas. The vehicle became available in 2WD and 4WD drivetrains with orders coming in the first quarter of 2014 for special service models, followed by the orders for the police pursuit models afterwards.

When production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle in 2001.  In 2005, LSSV production switched to [[AM General]], a unit of [[MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings]]. The LSSV is a GM-built [[Chevrolet Silverado#First Generation (1999-2007)|Chevrolet Silverado 1500]], [[Chevrolet Silverado#Heavy Duty|Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD]], [[Chevrolet Tahoe#2001-2006|Chevrolet Tahoe]], or [[Chevrolet Suburban#Tenth Generation (2000–2006)|Chevrolet Suburban]] that is powered by a Duramax 6.6 liter turbo diesel engine. As GM has periodically redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001 to the present, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.&lt;ref name=LSSV&gt;{{cite web|title=Light Service Support Vehicle (LSSV)|url=http://olive-drab.com/idphoto/id_photos_lssv.php|work=Olive-Drab|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The militarization of standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook, tow shackles and a 24/12 volt electrical system. The dashboard has additional controls and dataplates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.&lt;ref name="LSSV"/&gt; In the Canadian Army these vehicles are nicknamed "Milverado".

The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds an uprated suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking rear differential, beadlock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units have been sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.&lt;ref name=LSSV /&gt;

      <text bytes="4925" xml:space="preserve">The '''Chevrolet El Morocco''' was a customized full-size car produced by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Businessperson|businessman]] Reuben Allender based on the 1956 and 1957 Chevrolet. The relationship with [[Chevrolet]] began with Allender, a wealthy businessman who had had built a business in the surplus textile industry and had a dream of building his own car. He was a long-time buyer of [[Cadillac|Cadillacs]], with the ambition to build a smaller, lighter car that would be styled after them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coachbuilt.com/bui/a/allender/allender.htm|title=El Morocco, R. Allender &amp; Company, 1956 Chevrolet, 1957 Chevy, Bel Air, Reuben Allender, Baby Cadillac - CoachBuilt.com|website=coachbuilt.com|access-date=2020-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Impressed by his 1955 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], Allender felt that he could recreate its elegance and prestige, but lower the price by basing his dream car on the contemporary [[Chevrolet Bel Air]]. He originally chose the 1955 Bel Air as the basis for his project, but work did not begin until 1956. The first-year El Morocco was based on the 1956 Bel Air Sport Coupe and Convertible. Looking for a name that sounded like "Eldorado", but not wanting to get into trouble from Cadillac, he chose "El Morocco," named after a popular [[Manhattan]] nightclub. He managed to get the brand legally registered, so all El Moroccos were licensed as such, not as Chevrolets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1956-1957-chevrolet-el-morocco.htm|title=1956-1957 Chevrolet El Morocco|date=2007-10-24|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2020-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
Allender bolted and [[Epoxy|epoxied]] Eldorado-style [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]] [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] to the rear deck&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and used side moldings borrowed from the Eldorado. On the front, he modified the grille by removing the Chevy crest while retaining the "V" emblem on the hood. He also added large [[Dagmar bumper|Dagmar front bumper guards]]. [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]-style "Sabre-Spoke" gold [[Anodizing|anodized]] wheel covers were modified with a custom El Morocco "V" emblem.

For 1957, Allender offered a new El Morocco based on the 1957 [[Chevrolet 210|Chevrolet Two-Ten]] Sport Coupe, Sport Sedan, and the Bel Air convertible. He removed the Chevy grille and replaced it with an aluminum egg crate insert. The "Chevrolet" lettering was replaced with El Morocco badges on the front and rear in block letters just over the "V." At the rear, the '57 El Morocco sported metal Eldorado-style rear fins welded to the rear quarters in the wake of a shortage of skilled fibreglass workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bright side "[[Hood scoop|scoop]]" moldings on the rear quarter panels gave the car more of a resemblance to the $13,000 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Allender's cars were at their core customized Chevrolets, albeit hand-built ones. Allender used stock parts where possible; for example, the Dagmar bumper elements were reversed 1937 Dodge headlight pods,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; whereas the taillights were 1955 Dodge units.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A [[Frazer (automobile)|Frazer]] horn button served as a front medallion,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and "saddle" pieces on the front door came from dash padding on a [[Willys]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Drivetrain|Drivetrains]] for all El Moroccos were strictly stock Chevrolet units. Standard was the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet small-block V8]] with a four-barrel [[carburetor]] and [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Sales ===
It is likely that even though the El Morocco cost significantly less than a Cadillac, it was still pricey for a Chevrolet, which would explain the small demand for the car. The primary reason for its low production numbers was the conversion price, which moved it too far out of reach for most consumers. It was too close to the base price for a Cadillac, plus it is believed that a profit was never made on the El Morocco. Allender sold between 10 and 20 El Moroccos in 1956 and 1957; ten hardtop sedans, two hardtop coupes, and two convertibles are known to have been created in 1957. Each car sold for approximately $1,000 more than an equivalent Bel Air.

Today, the El Morocco is a valuable collector's car, with one selling for $181,500 in 2016.

The '''Chevrolet Blazer'''  is a 5-seat [[Mid-size car|mid-size]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]] produced by [[General Motors]] brand [[Chevrolet]]. The vehicle went into production in December 2018 and sales began in January 2019 as a 2019 model. In China, it is a larger, 7-seat crossover SUV, which debuted in 2019 and will go on sale in 2020.

== Overview ==
The Blazer nameplate, whose history dates back to 1969 when it was introduced as a two-door large SUV,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/chevy-blazer-history/ “History of the Chevy Blazer”] from CNET (June 20, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced to the public in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] on June 21, 2018 as a mid-size CUV that will be slotted in between the compact [[Chevrolet Equinox|Equinox]] and the 3-row full-size Traverse. It will serve as a counterpart to the [[GMC Acadia]] in the midsize CUV segment and will be built on the same platform as the Acadia. The vehicle's design will detail a sporty-style look that takes its cues from the [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] but will have a CUV feel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2018/06/21/2019-chevy-blazer-official-info-pictures “The 2019 Chevy Blazer looks like the Camaro of crossovers”] from Autoblog (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motortrend.com/news/2019-chevrolet-blazer-first-look-reinventing-suv-cuv-world/ “2019 CHEVROLET BLAZER FIRST LOOK: REINVENTING THE SUV FOR A CUV WORLD”] from Motor Trend (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Powertrain ===
The Blazer will be powered by a standard 2.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] engine rated at {{convert|144|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|255|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. A 3.6&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]] engine option will also be available, offering up {{convert|227.5|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|365|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2018/jun/0621-2019-blazer.html “BOLD DESIGN DEFINES 2019 CHEVROLET BLAZER”] from Chevrolet (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transmission ===
The Blazer will make use of GM's 9-speed [[List of GM transmissions|9T50]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2019-chevrolet-blazer-gets-detailed-on-camera-126566.html |title=2019 Chevrolet Blazer Gets Detailed on Camera |author=Mircea Panait |publisher=autoevolution |date=2018-06-22 |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/5-ways-the-blazer-competes-outside-its-class-ar181707.html |title=5 Ways The Blazer Competes Outside Its Class |author=Safet Satara |publisher=TopSpeed |date=2018-07-08 |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same transmission is also used in the company's [[Chevrolet Cruze|Cruze]], [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]], and Equinox models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autoevolution.com/news/gm-hydra-matic-9t50-transmission-confirmed-for-chevrolet-cruze-malibu-equinox-113469.html |title=GM Hydra-Matic 9T50 Transmission Confirmed for Chevrolet Cruze, Malibu, Equinox |author=Mircea Panait |publisher=autoevolution |date=2016-12-06 |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trim levels and pricing ===
The Blazer will feature both FWD and AWD, with a choice of L, LT (1LT, 2LT, and 3LT), RS, and Premier trim levels.  It will have a starting [[MSRP]] of $29,995 (USD), including destination charge, for the base L model when it officially goes on sale in January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/09/2019-blazer-price-chevy-mid-size-crossover-suv-starts-at-29995/ "2019 Blazer Price Starting at $29,995"] from GM Authority (September 25, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard features on all Blazer models include the [[Chevrolet]] Infotainment 3 system with eight-inch touchscreen and [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] [[smartphone]] integration, [[OnStar]] with 4G [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] Wi-Fi capabilities, keyless entry with keyless access and push-button start, and alloy wheels. Options include remote start, upgraded alloy wheels, a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] premium audio system, GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a power sunroof, heated and ventilated front bucket seats with driver's memory, red interior accents (RS trim only), and a power tailgate.

Chevrolet also announced that ten colors, three exhaust styles, and seven wheel designs, will be featured for the Blazer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/10/2019-blazer-colors-exterior-and-interior-hues-uncovered/ “2019 Blazer Colors: Exterior and Interior Hues Uncovered”] from GM Authority (October 3, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/10/chevrolet-2019-blazer-offers-three-different-exhaust-outlet-styles/ “Chevy’s 2019 Blazer Offers Three Different Exhaust Outlet Styles”] from GM Authority (October 17, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/11/2019-blazer-wheels-new-chevy-suv-offers-7-rim-choices/ “Blazer Wheels: New Chevy SUV Offers Seven Rim Choices”] from GM Authority (November 7, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes==
===2020===
The 2020 model year Blazer will see a 2.0L turbocharged 4 cylinder LSY engine that will be optional on 2LT and 3LT level trims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/06/2020-chevrolet-blazer-the-complete-engine-lineup/ “2020 Chevrolet Blazer: The Complete Engine Lineup”] from GM Authority (from GM Authority (June 28, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three-row version==
In November 2018 at [[Auto Guangzhou]], Chevrolet unveiled the '''FNR-CarryAll''' concept, a larger 3-row crossover SUV counterpart of the Blazer.  It had a length of 5,000&amp;nbsp;mm (196 inches) on a wheelbase of 2,867&amp;nbsp;mm (112.87 inches), a width of 2,258&amp;nbsp;mm (88.9 inches) including mirrors and height of 1,693&amp;nbsp;mm (66.65 inches). It previewed a production version, to be sold in countries where it could fill the same full-size crossover SUV slot reserved for the Traverse due to the latter's length and width. 

On November 8, 2019, Chevrolet officially introduced the 3-row, 7-seat Blazer during 2019 Chevrolet Gala Night, a special event held in the Chinese city of Hefei. The Blazer, using the same model name as the 2-row version available in other markets, will serve as its flagship SUV in China albeit marketed as a full size vehicle. There will be three trim levels available: standard, RS, and Redline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/11/gm-teases-upcoming-three-row-chevrolet-blazer-xl/ "GM Teases All-New Three-Row Chevrolet Blazer XL In China"] from GM Authority (November 3, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/03/gm-reveals-the-three-row-chevrolet-blazers-interior/ “GM Reveals The Three-Row Chevrolet Blazer’s Interior”] from GM Authority (March 9, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, in addition to China, Chevrolet has looked at Brazil and South Korea as key markets, but they have yet to be confirmed for production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/02/gm-to-debut-three-row-chevrolet-blazer-xl-in-2020-exclusive/ "GM To Debut Three-Row Chevrolet Blazer XL in 2020: Exclusive"] from GM Authority (February 25, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; Chevrolet will not make the 3-row Blazer available to North American markets, where it was rumored to be called the "Blazer XL".

== Production and assembly ==
[[File:2019 Chevrolet Blazer RS 3.6L, front 8.18.19.jpg|thumb|right|2019 Blazer '''RS''']]
Intended to be built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, or possibly Lordstown, Ohio, GM chose the [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly]] in Mexico instead due to its capabilities to assemble midsize vehicles and to allow the Spring Hill facilities to focus more on producing the Acadia and [[Cadillac XT5]] because of shift hour issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/06/2019-blazer-to-be-built-in-mexico/ “2019 Blazer To Be Built In Mexico”] from GM Authority (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 2018, Chevrolet began production on the Blazer in Ramos Arizpe, phasing out production of the discontinued [[Chevrolet Cruze]] altogether. The latter ended its North American production in March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bomey |first=Nathan |title=GM to kill Chevrolet Volt, Cruze, Impala as Americans ditch passenger cars |work=Detroit Free Press |date=November 26, 2018 |url=https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2018/11/26/chevrolet-volt-cruze-impala/2114433002/ |accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Centeno| first=Deivis| title=GM To Also End Chevy Cruze Production In Mexico| work=GM Authority |date=November 28, 2018| accessdate=November 28, 2018| url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/11/gm-to-also-end-chevy-cruze-production-in-mexico/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy from Trump and UAW ==

The decision to build the Blazer in Mexico was criticized by the [[United Auto Workers]], who wanted the vehicle built in the United States and is disappointed by GM's reason behind the announcement to begin production outside the country, citing GM's decision to cut back on its second shift workforce (and announced shutdown) at the [[Lordstown Assembly]] and moving production to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/06/uaw-unhappy-over-decision-to-build-2019-blazer-in-mexico/ “UAW Unhappy Over Decision To Build 2019 Blazer In Mexico”] from GM Authority (June 22, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/09/gm-ceo-mary-barra-still-wont-commit-to-lordstown-plants-future/ "GM CEO Mary Barra Still Won’t Commit To Lordstown Plant’s Future"] from GM Authority (September 27, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2019, the UAW announced that it has ordered its members to boycott the Blazer. Terry Dittes, director of the UAW's GM Department, said the automaker has doubled down on cheaper labor in Mexico and continues to use temporary workers at U.S. plants, which robs laid-off UAW members of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/01/uaw-advocates-for-boycott-on-mexico-made-chevrolet-blazer/ "UAW Advocates For Boycott on Mexico-Made Chevrolet Blazer"] from GM Authority (January 10, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While GM had already decided on Ramos Arizpe prior to the development of the Blazer, the union, as well as the automotive industry in general, is concerned that the possibility of President [[Donald Trump]]’s statement about raising tariffs on vehicles built outside the United States and threats to force automakers to bring jobs back to the country (based on his [[Twitter]] message made on June 22, 2018) could make things complicated, but GM has dismissed those theories and is confident about the Blazer’s prospects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-22/gm-ignores-trump-call-for-u-s-jobs-by-building-blazer-in-mexico “GM Building Chevy Blazer in Mexico Risks Provoking Trump's Ire”] from Bloomberg (June 22, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The move also gave concerns for lawmakers from both political parties. U.S. Congresswoman [[Debbie Dingell]] (D-Michigan), herself a former executive at GM, said her former employer's decision to idle U.S. plants in 2019, on top of the decision to produce the Blazer in Mexico, reinforces a belief that the just-agreed [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement|USMCA deal made by President Trump]] doesn't correct the soon-to-be-replaced [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]'s problems: "Before I approve any trade agreement I am going to make sure we're writing trade agreements that level the playing field for the working men and women of this country, and that we're keeping jobs here, not making it easier to keep shipping jobs overseas... This GM announcement gives me greater concern, not less."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20181210/OEM01/181219956/gm-cutbacks-usmca-nafta-trump-dingell "GM cutbacks complicate USMCA's path to passage"] from Automotive News (December 11, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 2019, a Blazer and a [[Chevrolet Silverado]] were placed atop the Chevrolet Fountain at Detroit's [[Comerica Park]], as the official vehicles for the [[Detroit Tigers]]' 2019 MLB baseball season.  The Blazer was replaced a few days later by a Traverse, after complaints from automotive workers and enthusiasts in the local media, pointing out that it was made in Mexico, and the park's proximity to GM's Detroit-Hamtramck assembly, which is scheduled to go idle in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/gm-removes-2019-chevrolet-blazer-from-comerica-display/ "GM Removes 2019 Chevrolet Blazer From Comerica Display"] from GM Authority (April 1, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sales ==
The news and buzz surrounding the Blazer and its expectations has paid off with customers acquiring the SUV ahead of its January 2019 debut. According to GM, the first 27 units were sold in December 2018, a rarity for a soft launch among GM vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/01/chevrolet-blazer-sales-kick-off-right-on-schedule/ "Chevrolet Blazer Sales Kick Off Right On Schedule"] from GM Authority (January 3, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of first quarter 2019, it had sold 3,023 units in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/chevrolet-blazer-sales-numbers-figures-results-first-quarter-2019-q1/ "Chevrolet Blazer Sales Tally 3,023 In Q1 2019"] from GM Authority (April 17, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; By the fourth quarter of 2019, it immediately swelled to 23,008 units sold, and closed out 2019 with 58,115 units sold overall, making it one of Chevrolet's fastest selling brands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/01/gm-sales-figures-numbers-results-united-states-q4-2019/ U.S. GM Sales Decrease 6.3 Percent To 735,909 Units In Fourth Quarter 2019] from GM Authority (January 3, 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

== International markets ==
===North America===
Although the Blazer debuted in the United States and Canada in December 2018, the vehicle was not launched in Mexico, where the CUV is built, until mid-February 2019. This gives all three countries a complete crossover and SUV lineup, ranging from the Trax all the way up to the Suburban. The Mexican version differs from the ones built for U.S. and Canada markets, as the levels trims are Tela (replacing L), Piel (replacing Premier), and RS, exclusive to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/02/chevrolet-launches-2019-blazer-in-mexico/ "Chevrolet Launches 2019 Blazer In Mexico"] from GM Authority (February 14, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The larger version of the Blazer was introduced in China in November 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/11/chevrolet-fnr-carryall-concept-gives-the-blazer-a-third-row/ "Chevrolet FNR-CarryAll Concept Gives The Blazer A Third Row"] from GM Authority (November 15, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-sales began in March 2020, with deliveries starting by mid-year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/03/three-row-chevrolet-blazer-presale-starts-in-china/ Three-Row Chevrolet Blazer Pre-Orders Start In China]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
Chevrolet will also sell the Blazer in South American markets, with Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia (where they expect to modify their roster) receiving the vehicle in 2019 as part of its lineup expansion in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/11/2019-blazer-announced-for-colombia-goes-on-sale-next-year/ "2019 Blazer Announced For Colombia, Goes On Sale Next Year"] from GM Authority (November 18, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/01/seven-new-chevrolet-models-to-launch-in-south-america-in-2019/ "Seven New Chevrolet Models To Launch In South America In 2019"] from GM Authority (January 22, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
GM was looking at expanding the Blazer to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] as a [[Holden]], up until GM’s decision to eliminate the Holden brand in 2020. It would have been slotted as a mid size entry between the Acadia and Equinox (both vehicles whose future in this region is cloudy due to Holden’s demise) as part of its expansion of its North American vehicles into this region; with Chevrolet planning to export vehicles to this region, it is not known at this point if the Blazer will be among the CUVs joining the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motoring.com.au/new-chevrolet-blazer-could-become-a-holden-113301/ "New Chevrolet Blazer could become a Holden"] from Motoring (June 25, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia/Middle East===
GM began selling the Blazer in the Middle East and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]] (excluding [[Iran]]) in June 2019. The features are the same as the North American version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/05/2019-blazer-launches-next-month-in-the-middle-east/ "2019 Blazer Launches Next Month (June 2019) In The Middle East"] from GM Authority (May 6, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nameplate ==
The use of the Blazer nameplate on a midsize CUV has sparked mixed reviews, mostly from fans of the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|K5 Blazer]] and [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|S-10 Blazer]] SUVs, as well as the [[Chevrolet TrailBlazer|TrailBlazer]] faithful, who were disappointed in Chevrolet applying it to a CUV instead of importing the international TrailBlazer to North America, building it as an SUV on the same platform as the [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]]/[[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe]], or putting it on an SUV platform based on the [[Chevrolet Colorado|Colorado]], hopefully as an answer to Ford's planned revival of the [[Ford Bronco|Bronco]], citing the Blazer's history as an adventurous off-road vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/news/2019-chevrolet-blazer-article-1.4040789 “First Look: Chevrolet confirms the return of the Blazer, but it’s a crossover and not a Bronco-busting SUV”] from New York Daily News (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gearjunkie.com/2019-chevy-blazer-why “2019 Blazer: Why Chevy, Why!?”] from Gear Junkies (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedrive.com/news/21696/2019-chevrolet-blazer-this-is-not-the-blazer-were-looking-for “2019 Chevrolet Blazer: This Is Not the Blazer We're Looking For”] from The Drive (June 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  The TrailBlazer will return to North America as a compact crossover that will be slotted below the Equinox  in 2020 as a 2021 model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.autoblog.com/2019/05/29/2021-chevy-trailblazer-revealed-blazer-little-brother/ "2021 Chevy Trailblazer is revealed as the Blazer's little sibling"] from Autoblog (May 29, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In a side-by-side comparison with the [[Ford Edge]], ''[[Car and Driver]]'' declared the Blazer the best, for its "responsive and stable handling, aggressive styling, and stout V-6 engine."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26574466/2019-chevrolet-blazer-vs-2019-ford-edge/ "2019 Chevrolet Blazer RS and 2019 Ford Edge Titanium Face Off: Which Is Detroit's Best Two-Row Mid-Size SUV?"] from ''[[Car and Driver]]'' (April 10, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

The car shared its [[GM F platform|platform]] and major components with the [[Pontiac Firebird]], also introduced for 1967.

Four distinct generations of the Camaro were developed before production ended in 2002. The nameplate was revived on a [[concept car]] that evolved into the [[Chevrolet Camaro (fifth generation)|fifth-generation Camaro]]; production started on March 16, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http://image.emerald.gm.com/gmnews/viewmonthlyreleasedetail.do?domain=3&amp;docid=27934 |title= Auto Buyers Have Spoken: GM Will Build An All-New Chevrolet Camaro |date= August 10, 2006 |publisher= GM Media Online |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070225053150/http://media.gm.com/servlet/GatewayServlet?target=http%3A%2F%2Fimage.emerald.gm.com%2Fgmnews%2Fviewmonthlyreleasedetail.do%3Fdomain%3D3&amp;docid=27934 |archivedate= February 25, 2007 |accessdate= April 5, 2016 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 5 million Camaros have been sold.

== Background ==
Before any official announcement, reports began running during April 1965 within the automotive press that [[Chevrolet]] was preparing a competitor to the [[Ford Mustang]], code-named ''Panther''.&lt;ref name="PantherDied"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/The_Day_the_Panther_Died |title=The Day the Panther Died |last=Settlemire |first=Scott |work=GM Heritage Center |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715205006/https://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/The_Day_the_Panther_Died |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 1966, around 200 automotive journalists received a telegram from General Motors stating, "...please save noon of June 28 for important SEPAW meeting. Hope you can be on hand to help scratch a cat. Details will follow...(signed) John L. Cutter&amp;nbsp;– Chevrolet public relations&amp;nbsp;– SEPAW secretary." The following day, the same journalists received another General Motors telegram stating, "Society for the Eradication of Panthers from the Automotive World will hold first and last meeting on June 28...(signed) John L. Cutter&amp;nbsp;– Chevrolet public relations SEPAW secretary." These telegrams puzzled the automotive journalists.&lt;ref name="PantherDied"/&gt;

On June 28, 1966, General Motors held a live press conference in Detroit's Statler-Hilton Hotel. It was the first time that [[conference call|14 cities were connected in real time for a press conference via telephone lines]].&lt;ref name="PantherDied"/&gt; Chevrolet general manager [[Pete Estes]] started the news conference stating that all attendees of the conference were charter members of the ''Society for the Elimination of Panthers from the Automotive World'' and that this would be the first and last meeting of ''SEPAW''. Estes then announced a new car line, project designation ''XP-836'', with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter ''C'' such as the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]], [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]], [[Chevrolet Nova|Chevy II]], and [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]. He claimed the name, ''suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner'' and that ''to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... go.'' The ''Camaro'' name was then unveiled.&lt;ref name="PantherDied"/&gt; Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, ''what is a Camaro?'' and were told it was ''a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147864031 |title=Top 10: Muscle cars |last=Biggs |first=Henry |date=February 3, 2006 |publisher=MSN Cars UK |quote=When asked, Chevrolet sales executives claimed a Camaro was a: 'a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs'. |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723022033/http://cars.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=147864031 |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''The Complete Book of Camaro: Every Model Since 1967'', the name ''Camaro'' was conceived by Chevrolet merchandising manager Bob Lund and General Motors vice president Ed Rollett, while they were reading the book ''Heath's French and English Dictionary'' by James Boïelle and by de V. Payen-Payne printed in 1936. In the book ''The Complete Book of Camaro'', it states that Mr. Lund and Mr. Rollett found the word ''camaro'' in the French-English dictionary was [[slang]], to mean ''friend, pal, or comrade''. The article further repeated Estes's statement of what the word ''camaro'' was meant to imply, that the car's name "suggests the comradeship of good friends, as a personal car should be to its owner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Book of Camaro: Every Model Since 1967 |last=Newhardt |first=David |year=2013 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0-7603-3961-9 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the actual French word that has that meaning is "camarade," from which the English word "comrade" is derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comrade|title=Comrade - Definition of comrade|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not "camaro"; "camaro" is not a recognized word in the French language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.larousse.fr/ |title=Larousse |author=Éditions Larousse|work=larousse.fr |accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camaro was first shown at a press preview in Detroit on September 12, 1966, and later in Los Angeles, on September 19, 1966. Public introduction of the new model was on September 26, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= 4 |title=The Camaro White Book, 1967-2002 |first=Mike |last= Antonick |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7603-1879-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Camaro officially went on sale in dealerships on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 [[model year]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonick, p. 21.}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First generation (1967–1969) ==
{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)}}

[[File:'67 Chevrolet Camaro (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '12).JPG|thumb|[[Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)|First-generation Camaro]] ]]

The first-generation Camaro debuted in September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 on a new rear-wheel drive [[GM F platform|GM F-body platform]] and was available as a two-door [[coupé]] or [[convertible]] with 2+2 seating, and a choice of {{convert|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[inline-6]] or {{convert|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on|lk=in}}, {{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|396|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the [[Ford Mustang]], Chevrolet executives realized that their compact sporty car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]], would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its rear-engine design, as well as declining sales, partly due to the negative publicity from [[Ralph Nader]]'s book, ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]''. Therefore, the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as the Mustang and Chevy II Nova. In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro lasted until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro [[Fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaro|fifth-generation Camaro]].

The first-generation offered a standard, ''Super Sport'', and ''Rally Sport'' editions. In 1967, the Z/28 model was added featuring stripes on the hood and trunk, styled rally road wheels, and a {{convert|302|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. In the Rally Sport edition it was more the style of the car itself. Placed with the hideaway headlights, wing windows, and the more rounded out rear fender. Once they brought out the 1968 year they introduced the use of side marker lights. With the 1969 Camaro they did not have the wing windows as placed on the 1967 as well as having a more flat drawn out rear fender.

== Second generation (1970–1981) ==
{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)}}

[[File:1971 Camaro SS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Second-generation Camaro]] (1971 SS model shown)]]

Introduced in February 1970, the second-generation Camaro was produced through the 1981 model year, with cosmetic changes made in 1974 and 1978 model years. The car was heavily restyled and became somewhat larger and wider with the new styling. Still based on the [[GM F platform|F-body platform]], the new Camaro was similar to its predecessor, with a unibody structure, front subframe, an A-arm front suspension, and leaf springs to control the solid rear axle. ''Road &amp; Track'' picked the 1971 SS350 as one of the 10 best cars in the world in August 1971. RS (shown to the right), SS package was dropped in 1972 and reintroduced in 1996.

The 1980 and 1981 Z28 models included an air induction hood scoop with an intake door that opened under full throttle.

== Third generation (1982–1992) ==
{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)}}

[[File:Chevrolet Camaro Z28 (10065927676).jpg|thumb|right|[[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Third-generation Camaro]] (1983 Z/28-E model shown)]]

The third-generation Camaro was produced from 1981 (for the 1982 model year) to 1992. These were the first Camaros to offer modern fuel injection, [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] 700R4 four-speed [[automatic transmission]]s, five-speed [[manual transmission]]s, 14,15- or 16-inch wheels, a standard OHV [[GM Iron Duke engine#Tech IV|4-cylinder]] engine,&lt;ref&gt;Antonick, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hatchback]] bodies. The cars were nearly {{convert|500|lb|kg|0}} lighter than the second generation model.

The [[International Race of Champions|IROC]]-Z was introduced in 1985 and continued through 1990. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) Regulations required a CHMSL (Center High Mounted Stop Lamp) starting with the 1986 model year. For 1986, the new brake light was located on the exterior of the upper center area of the back hatch glass. Additionally, the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L Iron Duke pushrod 4-cylinder engine was dropped, and all base models now came with the 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 (OHV). For 1987 and later, the CHMSL was either mounted inside the upper hatch glass, or integrated into a rear spoiler (if equipped). In 1985, the {{convert|305|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} small block V8 was available with [[indirect injection]] called "tuned port injection" (TPI). In 1987 the L98 {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine became a regular option on the IROC-Z, paired with an automatic transmission only. The convertible body style returned in 1987 (absent since 1969) and all came with a special ''"20th Anniversary Commemorative Edition''" leather map pocket. 1992 offered a ''"25th Anniversary Heritage Package"'' that included stripes and a unique spoiler plaque. Beginning in 1988, the 1LE performance package was introduced, optional on street models and for showroom stock racing in the U.S. and Canada. The [[Chevrolet Camaro B4C|B4C]] or "police" package was made available beginning in 1991. This created a Z28 in more subtle RS styling.

== Fourth generation (1993–2002) ==
{{Main|Chevrolet Camaro (fourth generation)}}

[[File:1997 Camaro Z28.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chevrolet Camaro (fourth generation)|Fourth-generation Camaro]] (1997 Z/28 model shown)]]

The fourth-generation Camaro debuted in 1993 on an updated [[GM F platform|F-body platform]]. It retained the same characteristics since its introduction in 1967: a coupé body style with 2+2 seating (with an optional [[T-top]] roof) or [[convertible]] (reintroduced in 1994), rear-wheel drive, pushrod 6-cylinder and [[V8 engine|V8]] engines. The standard powerplant from 1993-1995 was a 3.4&amp;nbsp;L V6, then a 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6 was introduced in 1995. A [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT1|350 MPFI (LT1) Small Block V-8 engine]], which was introduced in the Corvette in 1992, was standard in the Z28. Optional equipment included all-speed traction control and a new six-speed T-56 manual transmission; the 4L60E 4-speed automatic transmission was standard on the Z28, yet optional on the V6 models which came with a 5-speed manual as standard. Anti-lock brakes were standard equipment on all Camaros. A limited quantity of the SS version (1996-1997) came with the 330 HP [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT4|LT4]] small block engine from the Corvette, although most were equipped with the 275&amp;nbsp;hp LT1. The 1997 model year included a revised interior, and the 1998 models included exterior styling changes, and a switch to GM's aluminium block [[GM LS1 engine|LS1]] used in the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5|Corvette C5]]. In 1998, the 5.7&amp;nbsp;L LS1 was the first all-aluminum engine offered in a Camaro since the 1969 ZL-1 and carried a 305-horsepower rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.classicchevrolets.com/chevy-camaro-1993-2002/ |title=Chevy Camaro 1993 to 2002 |work=Chevrolet History |publisher=Classicchevrolets.com |date=May 26, 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SS versions (1998-2002) received slightly improved exhaust and intake systems, bigger wheels and tires, a slightly revised suspension for improved handling and grip while retaining ride comfort, an arc-shaped rear wing for downforce, and different gearing ratios for faster acceleration, over the Z28 models. Chevrolet offered a 35th anniversary edition for the 2002 model year. Production of the F-Body platform was discontinued due to slowing sales, a deteriorating market for sports coupés, and plant overcapacity, but an entirely new platform went on sale in 2009. The B4C Special Service Package for police agencies was carried over from the 3rd generation &amp; sold between 1993-2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/533524/posts |title=GM to Discontinue Camaro, Firebird |first=Ed |last=Garsten |agency=Associated Press |date= September 27, 2001 |newspaper=Free Republic |location=Fresno, CA |accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hotrod.com/articles/0409phr-2007-chevrolet-camaro/ |title= Rising from the Ashes |date=July 29, 2004 |last=Hunkins |first=Johnny |work=Hot Rod Network |quote= Publicly, GM blamed slow sales, a deteriorated sports coupé market, and plant overcapacity. |accessdate=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the development of the [[GM Zeta platform|Zeta architecture]] and because of its position as the GM global center of RWD development, [[GM Holden]] in Australia led the final design, engineering, and development of the Camaro. Production of the coupé began on March 16, 2009, in LS, LT, and SS trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/21/2010-chevy-camaro-official-details-and-images/ |title=2010 Chevy Camaro: Official Details and Images |last=Neff |first=John |date=July 21, 2008 |work=Autoblog |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jbcarpages.com/chevrolet/camaro/2010/ |title= 2010 Chevrolet Camaro Review |publisher=JB Car Pages |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; LS and LT models are powered by a {{convert|3.6|L|cuin|abbr=on}} V6 producing {{convert|312|hp|kW|abbr=on}} for the 2010 and 2011 models mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic with manual shift. The SS is powered by the {{convert|376|cuin|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} LS3 V8 producing {{convert|426|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and is paired with a 6-speed manual. The automatic SS has the L99 V8 with {{convert|400|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The RS appearance package is available on both the LT and SS and features 20-inch wheels with a darker gray tone, halo rings around xenon headlamps, a unique spoiler, and red RS or SS badges.

In addition to the original 2012 Camaro LS model. Chevrolet has manufactured the 2LS model. The 2LS model uses a slightly different rear axle ratio than the original LS. Having a 2.92 rear axle ratio this helps the vehicle get about 19/30 miles per gallon. The 2012 model allows drivers to reach 7200 rpm which higher than before for the V6; delivering an overall boost in the power and performance of the car. Almost all 2LS models have been released with various styles of a rear spoiler on the back as well. The 2LS was made for a better fuel mileage than the Camaro LS.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/buy/2012-Chevrolet-Camaro-2LS__2dr_Coupe/expert-review/|title=2012 Chevrolet Camaro New Car Test Drive|website=Autoblog|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2010, the Camaro was named the World Car Design of the Year at the [[World Car of the Year]] Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ausmotive.com/2010/04/08/chevrolet-camaro-world-car-design-of-the-year-2010.html |title= Chevrolet Camaro: World Car Design of the Year 2010 |publisher= AUSmotive.com |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January 2011, the production of 2011 Camaro Convertibles started. The first going to [[Rick Hendrick]] via [[Barret-Jackson]] Car Auction. Convertibles had the same options as the coupé (engines, RS, SS, etc.). The Camaro convertible added an aluminium brace over the engine assembly, and under the transmission. Due to the [[2011 Fukushima earthquake]], certain pigments were not available to make certain colors.

On November 2011, the export version (excluding Japanese version) of the Camaro was introduced after a two-year delay. The delay was due to the unexpected domestic demand. The export version included different [[Taillamps|tail lamps]] with integrated reverse and amber turn signal lamps, larger external rear view mirrors with integrated side turn signal repeaters, a rear bumper without reverse light inserts, and other changes as to comply with ECE regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.camaroz28.com/2011-export-camaro-details-differences/ |title= 2011 Export Camaro Details &amp; Differences |publisher= camaroz28.com |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not in continuous production for the entire period, the 2012 model year marked the 45th anniversary of the Camaro and this was commemorated with a model available only in "Carbon Flash Metallic" paint. This edition Camaro also included a unique stripe package, red, white, and blue interior stitching and 45th edition exclusive 20-inch wheels. The V6 was updated to a 3.6&amp;nbsp;L "LFX" engine producing {{convert|323|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The SS model received an upgrade to the suspension system. All models received the RS spoiler and taillight details, steering wheel-mounted volume and radio controls, and Bluetooth connectivity controls as standard. The 2012 ZL1 Camaro included a 6.2&amp;nbsp;L LSA supercharged V8 producing {{convert|580|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. This engine was first used in the Cadillac CTS-V for the 2009 model year. Other features included a 2-stage exhaust, the addition of suede seats, steering wheel, and shift knob, as well as ZL1-exclusive 20-inch aluminum wheels. In 2012, Chevrolet unveiled the production of the 2013 Camaro ZL1 Convertible.

The 2014 Camaro was unveiled at the 2013 New York Auto Show, with a refreshed body style and the return of a Z/28 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mlive.com/auto/index.ssf/2013/03/2014_chevrolet_camaro_debuts_a.html |title=2014 Chevrolet Camaro, Camaro Z/28 debut at New York Auto Show |first=Michael |last=Wayland |work=MLive |date=March 30, 2013 |publisher=Booth Newspapers |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upgrades included a slimmer grille along with a larger lower fascia and new fog lights along with taillights that took styling cues from the original first generation Camaro.

The new Z/28 features upgrades intended to improve lap times, and as with the original Z/28, air conditioning is an option. The Z/28 model retains only one speaker for the seat belt chime, the rear quarter glass has been thinned, rear seats have been thinned, and most of the sound deadening has been removed in an effort to reduce the weight of the vehicle.

== Racing ==
[[File:Trans-Am-01.jpg|thumb|right|Vintage Trans-Am racing of today]]
[[File:Camaro Cup 35.jpg|thumb|[[Camaro Cup]] race car]]

The Camaro was one of the vehicles in the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]]-sanctioned [[Trans-Am Series]]. Chevrolet worked with [[Roger Penske]] to operate their unofficially factory-backed Trans Am team, winning the title in 1968 and 1969 with [[Mark Donohue]]. [[Jim Hall (race car driver)|Jim Hall]]'s Chaparral team replaced Penske for the 1970 season. Warren Agor of Rochester, NY, was the series' leading Camaro privateer, his orange #13's o, 1993, 1994, and 1998.

There was also another SCCA Trans-Am Series Camaro that was not popular because of racing but because of its body modifications. This Camaro, number 13, had been built and driven by Henry “Smokey” Yunick. Smokey Yunick was a car builder who worked to reduce the weight of his cars by acid-dipping body parts and installing thinner safety glass.

Camaro-styled cars also race in the [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], with all Chevrolet teams having used the body since 2013.

The Penske/Donohue Camaros also had the front sheet metal dropped, all four fenders widened, windshield laid back, front sub-frame “Z’d” to lower the car, the floor pan moved up and even the drip-rails were moved closer to the body. This Camaro had always kept its stock look and had a 302 engine that was able to produce 482 horsepower. One part that had come out of his testing was the Edelbrock Cross-Manifold. To this day the Smokey Yunick 1968 Camaro is owned by Vic Edelbrock Jr.

[[Bob Jane]] won both the [[1971 Australian Touring Car Championship|1971]] and [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]] [[Australian Touring Car Championship]]s at the wheel of a Camaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/a/australiantouringcarchampionship.php |title= Australian Touring Car Championship |publisher=Cars and Racing Stuff |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camaro was the official car of and used in the [[International Race of Champions]] starting in 1975 and lasting for 12 years until 1989. It was the first American car of the series succeeding the [[Porsche Carrera|Porsche Carrera RSR]].

Camaros are a favorite in [[drag racing]], having won many championships, and can be currently found in several series from the [[National Hot Rod Association]], [[International Hot Rod Association]], and [[United States Hot Rod Association]]. [[Road racing]] Camaros can currently be found in the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s American Sedan series. They have also been the vehicle used in the Swedish [[Camaro Cup]] series since 1975.

The Camaro was the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car in 1967, 1969, 1982, 1993, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2016. The Camaro also paced races at Daytona, Watkins Glen, Mosport in Canada, and Charlotte Motor Speedway.

The Camaro was also a regular in the [[IMSA GT Series]].

The fifth-generation Camaro took to the tracks in 2010 in the GT class of the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand Am]] Road Racing Championship. Stevenson Motorsports announced that it was seeking to run a two-car team of [[Pratt &amp; Miller]] built cars, based on the same spaceframe as the Pontiac GXP-R.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with John Stevenson, Speed TV Grand Am Montreal 200 broadcast, August 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The team also competed with Camaros in the Grand Sports class of the Grand-Am's Continental Tire Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=Stevenson Motorsports |url= http://cdn.motosnap.com/DealerImages/Website_1193/111308%20Stevenson%20Camaro%20KONI%20Press%20Release.pdf |title= Stevenson Motorsports to Race a Brand New Chevrolet Camaro in the Grand-Am KONI Challenge Series |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Camaro ZL1 was introduced in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] in 2018, replacing the discontinued [[Holden Commodore (VF)|Chevrolet SS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crossman|first=Matt|url=http://autoweek.com/article/nascar-sprint-cup/camaro-zl1-chevys-pick-2018-monster-energy-nascar-cup-series-car|title=Camaro ZL1 is Chevy's pick for 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series car|publisher=Autoweek |date=August 10, 2017|accessdate=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, 2018, [[Austin Dillon]] won the [[2018 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] in the ZL1's debut.

The final moments of the 2018 reboot film ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'' reveal that the Camaro was his third-ever form that he took on upon arriving on Earth, after a Jeep and a Volkswagen Beetle.

[[Hot Wheels]] has been making several versions of the Camaro since 1968, with the "Custom Camaro" being the first of the original lineup. Chevrolet worked with [[Lego]] to create a special "Lego Speed Champions" version of the Camaro.

'''''Exodus''''' is a [[Custom car|customized]] 1959 [[Chevrolet Impala#yr|Chevrolet Impala]] built by [[Bill Cushenberry]] in 1961. 

Built for Tony Cardoza, ''Exodus'' debuted at the 1961 Monterey Kar Kapades.&lt;ref&gt; Mauldin, Calvin. "Bill Cushenberry:  Custom Creations for the Future", in ''Rod &amp; Custom'', December 1998, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; It had twin vertical headlights.&lt;ref&gt; Mauldin, Calvin. "Bill Cushenberry:  Custom Creations for the Future", in ''Rod &amp; Custom'', December 1998, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; It also had chromed [[Bumper bullet|dagmar]]s.&lt;ref&gt; Mauldin, Calvin. "Bill Cushenberry:  Custom Creations for the Future", in ''Rod &amp; [sic] Custom'', December 1998, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every body panel was altered in some way, setting a new trend in customizing.&lt;ref&gt; Mauldin, Calvin. "Bill Cushenberry:  Custom Creations for the Future", in ''Rod &amp; Custom'', December 1998, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Exodus'' and [[El Matador (custom car)|''El Matador'']], which appeared the same year, drew a lot of attentioin to Cushenberry and a lot of custom work for his shop.&lt;ref&gt; Mauldin, Calvin. "Bill Cushenberry:  Custom Creations for the Future", in ''Rod &amp; Custom'', December 1998, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5724" xml:space="preserve">'''The Reactor''' is a [[show rod]] built by [[Gene Winfield]]. It appeared in episodes of four [[Television series|TV series]]:  "[[Bewitched]]" (which had an episode written around it), [[Star Trek: The Original Series|"Star Trek"]], [[Batman (TV series)|"Batman"]], and  "[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]".

== History ==
After completing construction of his [[Strip Star (custom car)|''Strip Star'']] car, Winfield's next project was even more ambitious. Joe Kizis, an East Coast show promoter, held an annual Autorama, an indoor rod and custom car show in Hartford, Connecticut. Kizis gave Winfield a $20,000 commission to build a show car named the ''Autorama Special''.&lt;ref name="automag28jun2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harpies"/&gt; Designed by [[Ben Delphia]],&lt;ref name="sr-jul2003"/&gt; this vehicle later became known as ''The Reactor''.

== Construction details ==
''Reactor'' is a [[Front mid-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engined front wheel drive]] two seater. The bodywork, like that on Winfield's ''Strip Star'', is of lightweight aluminum. The front wheels are exposed and fenderless, while the rears are enclosed by the bodywork and skirts. The roof panel is hinged at the rear and, together with the windshield, tilts up and back to give access to the interior.

''Reactor'' was finished in a trademark Winfield fadeaway paint job, changing from metalflake gold on top to green below.&lt;ref name="sr-jul2003"/&gt;

The car's low hoodline was made possible by its use of a version of the [[Chevrolet Turbo-Air 6 engine]].&lt;ref name="lvcc-apr2016"/&gt; A similar engine was used in the [[The Pirana (custom car)|''Piranha'']].&lt;ref name="c-we-piranha"/&gt;  Winfield took the air-cooled {{convert|180|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Turbocharging|turbocharged]] [[flat-six engine]] from a [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair Corsa]] and mated it to the drive-train from a 1962 [[Citroën ID]],&lt;ref name="automag28jun2017"/&gt;

Winfield kept the wide front and narrow rear [[Axle track|track]] of the  donor Citroën&lt;ref name="fokti"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}, as well as its [[height adjustable suspension]]&lt;ref name="c-we-winfield"/&gt;, which enables the car's ground clearance to be varied from {{convert|4| to |9+1/2|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name="kustomrama"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}

== Television appearances ==
* "[[Bewitched]]", episode "Super Car".&lt;ref name="c-we-winfield"/&gt;
* [[Star Trek: The Original Series|"Star Trek"]], episode "Bread and Circuses" (as the Jupiter 8)
* [[Batman (TV series)|"Batman"]], episode "The Funny Feline Felonies" (as the Catmobile)&lt;ref name="tvlegends"/&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Series C Classic Six'''  is the first automobile produced by American car manufacturer [[Chevrolet]]. It is one of the few Chevrolets made while record-setting [[Buick]] race car driver [[Louis Chevrolet]] was with the company. This [[Brass Era car|Brass Era]] Chevy was much larger, more powerful, more stylized and therefore more expensive than the cars that would ultimately replace it. Louis Chevrolet loved it, but William Durant had a cheaper car in mind.

==The first Chevrolet==

The 1912-14 '''Chevrolet Type C ''' also called the '''Chevrolet Classic Six (Series C)''', '''Chevrolet Model C''', '''Classic Six''' or, at the time it was new, simply '''the Chevrolet''' (since there were no other models to confuse it with until 1914 when the Model H and L were released), was the first Chevrolet, and was also sold by other makes. It was a well constructed car and had a 6-cylinder engine up front with a cone clutch and a three-speed gearbox mounted at the rear axle. [[Henry Ford]] had been selling his much less expensive Model T for three years, in six models by the time Chevrolet entered the market. The Chevrolets that followed, under the management of Durant, would be much cheaper 4-cylinder cars that competed directly with the T.  The Series C Classic Six, however, was capable of 65&amp;nbsp;mph and competed against the more high-performance cars of that time. Standard equipment included a starter, four doors, a folding top, a tool box, cowl lights, and electric headlights. 
The 1914 Classic Six was in essence the 1913 model with a few slight changes.

===Design===

Penned by Etienne Planche under direction from Louis Chevrolet&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldcarsweekly.com/car-of-the-week/car-week-1913-chevrolet-classic-six|title=Car of the Week: 1913 Chevrolet Classic Six|last=bearnest|date=2014-02-25|website=Old Cars Weekly|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Chevy with its low running boards had a design more resembling European cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1911-1912-1913-chevrolet-series-c-classic-six.htm|title=1911, 1912, 1913 Chevrolet Series C Classic Six|date=2007-08-01|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiator shell and Chevrolet nameplate on the dashboard (the "bow-tie" emblem did not appear until the 1914 Chevrolet Series H and L models) were polished metal, the body, chassis and wheels were only Chevrolet blue. The hood, fenders, and splash aprons were black. Light gray striping was found on the body and wheels. The first prototype car appeared in late 1911, and Louis Chevrolet himself tested it on the back streets of Detroit. Throughout 1912 refinements were made to the design. Later in that same year the new 1913 model was released at the New York Auto Show.

===The T-head engine===

Chevrolet's first engine was a liquid-cooled 299-cubic-inch, six-cylinder [[cast-iron]] block cast in three groups of two, with a T-head configuration, that produced 40 horsepower. The T-head engine is a side valve engine that is distinguished from the much more common [[flathead engine|L-head engine]] by its placement of the valves. The intake valves are on one side of the engine block and the exhaust valves on the other, making dual camshafts necessary. Seen from the end of the crankshaft, in cutaway view, the cylinder and combustion chamber resembles a T - hence the name "T-head". The 299 was a very large engine at that time and the only engine in the C Series. In 1913 the ignition was a [[Frederick Richard Simms|Simms magneto]] with a compressed-air starter. For 1914 the ignition was now a Simms High Tension Magneto and the starter used was a Gray &amp; Davis. This was the biggest Chevy engine until the 1958, 348 cid V-8.?

The prototype of Planches design was built in 1911. After several improvements were made to the car, they began production for commercial sales in late 1912. Production continued through 1913 and was stopped in 1914&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Production Amount==
It is unclear due to conflicting production records as to how many were actually made. Total Chevrolet production for 1913 was 5,987. But this figure included all Little Motor Car Co. production (The Little Motor car was made in the same factory) and could also have included all the 1914 models produced in 1913. It is doubtful given the high price of the car that many were made and sold. The [[serial number]] of the below listed existing cars at the Sloan Museum and the [[Reynolds-Alberta Museum]] in Canada may or may not be indicative of the exact number built.

==Surviving Examples==
[[File:Sloan Museum at Courtland Center December 2018 14 (1913 Chevrolet Classic 6).jpg|thumb|1913 Chevrolet Classic Six at the [[Sloan Museum]]]]

There are only 2 Classic Sixes known to exist. The oldest example is a 1913 model, serial #93 located in the [[Reynolds-Alberta Museum]] in Canada and is an unrestored partial car. 
The other is also a 1913 model, serial #323 located in Flint, Michigan at the Alfred P. Sloan Museum (shown above). This car is the only complete and fully restored running example.

The Sloan Museum car was first purchased in southern Texas, the Classic 6 was driven daily until 1936, when it was bought by the Aldenhaven Family in Ft. Worth (who owned a Chevy dealership). It remained part of their collection until 1964, when it was placed up for auction. The Sloan Museum had been following the car for some time, and sent two employees to Texas with a signed check. The Chevy was twice bid up beyond the Museum's offer, but the Aldenhavens accepted the Museum's offer any way, as they knew the car would be appreciated and well kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-oldest-running-chevrolet-5795774|title=This is the oldest running Chevrolet|last=Bryant|first=Jefferson|website=Jalopnik|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, when GM executives were looking to name the new Chevrolet sports car, assistant director for the Public Relations department [[Myron Scott]] suggested ''Corvette'' after the [[corvette|small maneuverable warship]]—and the name was approved.&lt;ref name="myron-naming"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Corvette |last=Falconer |first=Tom |year=2003 |publisher=Crestline |isbn=978-0-7603-1474-6 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCFqjW2AXTcC&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=Corvette++Myron+Scott |accessdate=Sep 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first model, a [[convertible (car)|convertible]], was introduced at the [[General Motors Motorama|GM Motorama]] in 1953 as a concept and was followed ten years later by the 1963 second generation, in coupe and convertible styles.

== History ==

=== First generation (C1; 1953–1962) ===
{{Main|Chevrolet Corvette (C1)}}

The first generation of Corvette was introduced late in the 1953 [[model year]]. Originally designed as a show car for the 1953 Motorama display at the New York Auto Show, it generated enough interest to induce GM to make a production version to sell to the public.  First production was on June 30, 1953.&lt;ref name="Tech Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emanuel |first=Dave|title=Corvette Tech Q &amp; A|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1557883766}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chevrolet Corvette Restoration Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter |first=Lindsay|title=Chevrolet Corvette Restoration Guide|year=1997|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0760303252|page=256|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqpUBaVCOtEC&amp;dq=Chevrolet+Corvette+(C1)+1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edmunds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/corvette/history.html |title=Chevrolet Corvette History |publisher=Edmunds |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:1953 Chevrolet Corvette Motorama Show Car.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Chevrolet Corvette displayed at the 1953 GM Motorama car show.]]

This generation was often referred to as the "solid-axle" models (the [[independent rear suspension]] was not introduced until the second generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Classic Corvette 30 Years|year=2003|publisher=Crestline Imprints|isbn=978-0760318065|page=384|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBtsVHSnt5gC&amp;dq=Solid+axle+Corvette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three hundred hand-built polo white Corvette [[convertible (car)|convertibles]] were produced for the 1953 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Richard|title=Corvette Buyers Guide, 1953-1967|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0760310090|page=192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fqyf5ceXucC&amp;dq=Corvette+rushed+into+production|date=2002-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1954 model year vehicles could be ordered in Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, Black, or Polo White; 3,640 were built, and sold slowly.

The 1953 and 1954 model years were the only model years of the Corvette were the only ones that were sold with an engine that wasn't a V8. The engine used in these two model years was a 235 Cu. In. (3.9L) version of the second- generation Blue Flame inline-six generating 150 horsepower.
 
The 1955 model offered a {{convert|265|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]] as an option. With a large inventory of unsold 1954 models, GM limited production to 700 for 1955. With the new V8, the 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph time improved by 1.5 seconds.&lt;ref name="Edmunds" /&gt;

=== Second generation (C2; 1963–1967) ===
{{Main|Chevrolet Corvette (C2)}}
[[File:1963 Corvette Sting Ray.jpg|thumb|right|1963 Corvette Sting Ray coupe]]

The second generation (C2) Corvette, which introduced '''Sting Ray''' to the model, continued with fiberglass body panels, and overall, was smaller than the first generation. The C2 was later referred to as ''mid-years''.&lt;ref name="Corvette Factories"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=The Corvette Factories: Building America's Sports Car|year=2009|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-3551-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogJxa6-rMLEC&amp;dq=c2+corvette+Larry+Shinoda}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was designed by [[Larry Shinoda]] with major inspiration from a previous concept design called the "Q Corvette," which was created by Peter Brock and Chuck Pohlmann under the styling direction of [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=March 2003 |issn=0032-4558|page=61|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c88DAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=c2+corvette+Larry+Shinoda |title= 50 Corvette |last1=Magazines |first1=Hearst }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Mitchell had sponsored a car known as the "[[Corvette Stingray (concept car)|Mitchell Sting Ray]]" in 1959 because Chevrolet no longer participated in factory racing.

Production started for the 1963 model year and ended in 1967. Introducing a new name, "Sting Ray", the 1963 model was the first year for a Corvette [[coupé]] and it featured a distinctive tapering rear deck (a feature that later reappeared on the 1971 "Boattail" [[Buick Riviera]]) with, for 1963 only, a split rear window. The Sting Ray featured hidden headlamps, non-functional hood vents, and an [[independent rear suspension]].&lt;ref name="Hot Rod Magazine's 1981 p.77"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hot Rod |title=Street Machines and Bracket Racing |issue=5 |year=1981 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corvette chief engineer [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] never liked the split rear window because it blocked rear vision, but Mitchell thought it to be a key part of the entire design. Maximum power for 1963 was {{convert|360|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and was raised to {{convert|375|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} in 1964. Options included [[electronic ignition]], the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic first offered on some 1963 [[Pontiac]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Super Street Cars|publisher=Super Street Cars|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1964 models the decorative hood vents were eliminated and Duntov, the Corvette's chief engineer, got his way with the split rear window changed to a full width window.

[[File:1965 Corvette Sting Ray.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Corvette Sting Ray coupe]]

Four-wheel [[disc brake]]s were introduced in 1965, as was a "[[big-block|big block]]" engine option: the [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#Generation 2: Mark IV Series|{{convert|396|cuin|L|abbr=on}}]] V8. Side exhaust pipes were also optionally available in 1965, and continued to be offered through 1967. The introduction of the {{convert|425|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|396|cuin|L|abbr=on}} big block in 1965 spelled the beginning of the end for the [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] fuel injection system.&lt;ref name="Nothin' but Muscle"&gt;{{cite book|author=Staff of Old Cars Weekly|title=Nothin' but Muscle|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=978-1-4402-1549-0|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6hBEhAvkUoC&amp;dq=1965+%22big+block%22+Sting+Ray+corvette}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|396|cuin|L|abbr=on}} option cost {{USD|292.70}} while the fuel injected {{convert|327|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine cost {{USD|538.00}}. Few people could justify spending {{USD|245.00}} more for {{convert|50|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} less, even though FI could deliver over 20 mpg on the highway and would keep delivering fuel despite high G-loading in corners taken at racing speeds.  Another rare '63 and '64 option was the Z06 competition package, which offered stiffer suspension, bigger, multi-segment lined brakes with finned drums, and more. Only a couple hundred coupes and a single convertible were factory-equipped this way in 1963.  With only 771 fuel-injected cars built in 1965, Chevrolet discontinued the option at the end of the '65 production, having introduced a less-expensive big block 396 engine rated at 425&amp;nbsp;hp in the middle of the production year and selling over 2,000 in just a few months. For 1966, Chevrolet introduced an even larger {{convert|427|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#427|Big Block]] version. Other options available on the C2 included the Wonderbar auto-tuning AM radio, AM-FM radio (mid-1963), air conditioning (late-1963), a telescopic steering wheel (1965), and headrests (1966). The Sting Ray's independent rear suspension was successfully adapted for the new-for-1965 [[Chevrolet Corvair]], which solved the quirky handling problems of that unique rear-engine compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=September 1988 |issn=0032-4558|url= https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_zOQDAAAAMBAJ |quote=Sting Ray's independent rear suspension was.|title=Driving the New Corvette |publisher=Hearst Magazines }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1967 Corvette Sting Ray 427.jpg|thumb|right|1967 Corvette Sting Ray convertible]]

1967 was the final year for the C2 generation. The 1967 model featured restyled fender vents, less ornamentation, and back-up lamps which were on the inboard in 1966 were now rectangular and centrally located. The first use of all four taillights in red started in 1961 and was continued thru the C-2 line-up except for the 1966. The 1967 and subsequent models continuing on all Corvettes since. 1967 had the first L88 engine option which was rated at {{convert|430|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}, but unofficial estimates place the actual output at {{convert|560|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CqX-40TnVUC&amp;pg=PA203 |last=Leffingwell|first=Randy |title=Corvette Fifty Years |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |page=203|isbn=978-0-7603-1180-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only twenty such engines were installed at the factory. From 1967 (to 1969), the Holley triple two-barrel carburetor, or [[Tri-Power]], was available on the 427 L89 (a $368 option, on top of the cost for the high-performance 427).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J.

Duntov came up with a lightweight version of the C2 in 1962. Concerned about Ford and what they were doing with the [[Shelby Cobra]], GM planned to manufacture 100 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)#Grand Sport|Grand Sport]] Corvettes, but only five were actually built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|year=2003|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c88DAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=Chevrolet+Corvette+(C2)+Grand+Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were driven by historic drivers such as [[Roger Penske]], [[A.

=== Third generation (C3; 1968–1982) ===
{{Main|Chevrolet Corvette (C3)}}
[[File:69 Corvette Stingray.jpg|thumb|1969 Corvette Stingray coupe with T-top panels removed]]
[[File:1971 Corvette coupe.jpg|thumb|1971 Corvette Stingray coupe]]

The third generation Corvette, patterned after the [[Corvette Mako Shark (Concept car)|Mako Shark II]] concept car, was introduced for the 1968 model year and was in production until 1982. C3 coupes featured the first use of [[T-top]] removable roof panels. It introduced monikers that were later revived, such as LT-1, ZR-1, Z07 and Collector Edition. In 1978, the Corvette's 25th anniversary was celebrated with a two-tone Silver Anniversary Edition and an Indy Pace Car replica edition of the C3. This was also the first time that a Corvette was used as a Pace Car for the [[Indianapolis 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|year=1977|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engines and chassis components were mostly carried over from the C2, but the body and interior were new. The {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} engine replaced the old {{convert|327|cuin|L|abbr=on}} as the base engine in 1969, but power remained at {{convert|300|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. 1969 was the only year for a C3 to optionally offer either a factory installed side exhaust or normal rear exit with chrome tips. The all-aluminum ZL1 engine was also new for 1969; the special big-block engine was listed at 430-hp (320&amp;nbsp;kW), but was reported to produce {{convert|560|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and propelled a ZL1 through the 1/4 mile in 10.89 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Corvette 50th Anniversary-specifications and performance-by the Editors of Consumer Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an extended production run for the 1969 [[model year]] due to a lengthy labor strike, which meant sales were down on the 1970 models, to 17,316.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p.734.&lt;/ref&gt; 1970 small-block power peaked with the optional high compression, high-revving LT-1 that produced {{convert|370|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The 427 big-block was enlarged to {{convert|454|cuin|L|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|390|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} rating. The ZR-1 special package was an option available on the 1970 through 1972 model years, and included the LT-1 engine combined with special racing equipment. Only 53 ZR-1's were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1971-corvette.htm |title=1971 Corvette |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date=2007-06-07|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, to accommodate regular low-lead fuel with lower anti-knock properties, the engine compression ratios were lowered which resulted in reduced power ratings. The power rating for the {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} L48 base engine decreased from 300 to 270 horsepower and the optional special high performance LT1 engine decreased from 370 to 330 horsepower.  The LS5 454 cu in (7.4 L) motor was carried over and produced 365&amp;nbsp;hp (272&amp;nbsp;kW). Offered in ‘71 only was the LS6 454 cu in (7.4 L) big-block featuring aluminum heads and delivering 425 hp (317 kW), highest of the 1970-72 series, and could be ordered with an automatic transmission. For the 1972 model year, GM moved to the [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE Net]] measurement which resulted in further reduced, but more realistic, power ratings than the previous SAE Gross standard.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Antonick|first=Mike|title=Corvette Black, Books 1953-2007|year=2006|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-2894-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9P-RNjfCeRYC&amp;dq=1971+Corvette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1972 model's {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} horsepower was actually the same as that for the 1971 model year, the lower net horsepower numbers were used instead of gross horsepower. The L48 base engine was now rated at {{convert|200|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and the optional LT1 engine was now rated at {{convert|270|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Corvette Black" /&gt; 1974 models had the last true dual exhaust system that was dropped on the 1975 models with the introduction of [[catalytic converter]]s requiring the use of no-lead fuel. Engine power decreased with the base ZQ3 engine producing {{convert|165|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, the optional L82's output {{convert|205|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the 454 big-block engine was discontinued. Gradual power increases after 1975 peaked with the 1980 model's optional L82 producing {{convert|230|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="SoOC" /&gt; The 1981 L82 had {{convert|190|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the 1982 L82 had {{convert|200|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

Styling changed subtly throughout the generation until 1978 for the car's 25th anniversary. The Sting Ray nameplate was not used on the 1968 model, but Chevrolet still referred to the Corvette as a Sting Ray; however, the 1969 (through 1976) models used the "[[Stingray]]" name as one word, without the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=James |first2=Tom |last2=Falconer |title=Corvette 1968-1982|year=2010|publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0-7603-3747-9|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oTh4irEsXCgC&amp;dq=1968+Corvette }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the body design was updated including fender flares, and interiors were refined, which included redesigned seats, and indication lights near the gear shift that were an early use of fiber optics . Due to government regulation, the 1973 Corvette's chrome front [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]] was changed to a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}}system with a [[polyurethane|urethane]] bumper cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNicholl|first=George A.|title=How to rebuild Corvette rolling chassis 1963-1982|year=2007|publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0-7603-3014-2|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1973 Corvettes are unique in that sense, as they are the only year where the front bumper was polyurethane and the rear retained the chrome two-piece bumper set. 1973 was also the last year chrome bumpers were used. The optional wire-spoked wheel covers (left) were offered for the last time in 1973. Only 45 Z07 were built in 1973. From 1974 onwards both the front and rear bumpers were polyurethane.&lt;ref name="Chevrolet Corvette Restoration Guide" /&gt;

In 1974, a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} rear bumper system with a two-piece, tapering urethane bumper cover replaced the [[Kammback|Kamm-tail]] and chrome bumper blades, and matched the new front design from the previous year. 1975 was the last year for the convertible, (which did not return for 11 years) and [[Dave McLellan]] succeeded [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] as the Corvette's Chief Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corvettemuseum.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716165801/http://www.corvettemuseum.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|date=July 16, 2011|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1976 models the fiberglass floor was replaced with steel panels to provide protection from the [[catalytic converter]]'s high [[operating temperature]]. For 15 model years the names Corvette, Sting Ray, and Stingray were synonymous. 1977 was last year the tunneled roof treatment with vertical back window was used, in addition leather seats were available at no additional cost for the first time.

The 1978 25th Anniversary model introduced the [[fastback]] glass rear window and featured a new interior and dashboard. Corvette's 25th anniversary was celebrated with the Indy 500 Pace Car limited edition and a Silver Anniversary model featuring silver over gray lower body paint. All 1979 models featured the previous year's pace car seats and offered the front and rear [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoilers]] as optional equipment.&lt;ref name="Corvette Factories" /&gt; 53,807 were produced for the model year, making 1979 the peak production year for all versions of the Corvette.

After several years of weight increases, 1980 Corvettes were lighter as engineers trimmed both body and chassis weight.&lt;ref name="Standard Catalog of Corvette" /&gt; In mid-1981, production shifted from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] (where all subsequent Corvette generations have been built since), and several two-tone paint options were offered. The 1981 models were the last available with a manual transmission until well into the 1984 production run. In 1982, a fuel-injected engine returned, and a final C3 tribute Collectors Edition featured an exclusive, opening rear window hatch.&lt;ref name="Standard Catalog of Corvette" /&gt;

The fourth generation Corvette was the first complete redesign of the Corvette since 1963. Production was to begin for the 1983 model year but quality issues and part delays resulted in only 43 prototypes for the 1983 model year being produced that were never sold. All of the 1983 prototypes were destroyed or serialized to 1984 except one with a white exterior, medium blue interior, L83 350 ci, 205&amp;nbsp;bhp V8, and 4-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="Tech Q&amp;A" /&gt; After extensive testing and modifications were completed, it was initially retired as a display sitting in an external wall over the Bowling Green Assembly Plant's employee entrance. Later this only surviving 1983 prototype was removed, restored and is now on public display at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. It is still owned by GM.&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=The complete book of Corvette : every model since 1953|publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=978-0760341407 |date=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Missing 1983 Corvette"&gt;{{cite web|last=Connell|first=Bill|title=The Missing 1983 Corvette|url=http://www.corvetteblog.com/2007/02/corvette-museum-the-missing-1983-corvette/|publisher=Corvette Blog|accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 12, 2014, it was nearly lost to a sinkhole which opened up under the museum.

Regular fourth generation production began on January 3, 1983; the 1984 model year and delivery to customers began in March 1983. The 1984 model carried over the {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[L83]] slightly more powerful (5&amp;nbsp;bhp) "Crossfire" V8 engine from the final 1982 third generation model.&lt;ref name="Corvette Factories" /&gt; New chassis features were aluminum brake calipers and an all-aluminum suspension for weight savings and rigidity. The new one piece targa top had no center reinforcement. A new electronic dashboard with digital [[liquid crystal displays]] for the speedometer and tachometer was standard. Beginning in 1985, the {{convert|230|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} L98 engine with tuned port fuel injection became the standard engine.&lt;ref name="Tech Q&amp;A" /&gt;

[[File:1986 Chevrolet Corvette C4 Convertible (10323231024).jpg|thumb|1986 Corvette convertible Indy 500 Pace Car Edition]]

September 1984 through 1988 Corvettes offered a Doug Nash designed "4+3" transmission – a 4-speed manual coupled to an automatic overdrive on the top three gears. It was designed to help the Corvette meet U.S. fuel economy standards.&lt;ref name="2003newtonprojects" /&gt; Since 1981 (when it was last offered), a manual transmission returned to the Corvette starting with production in late 1984. The transmission proved to be problematic and was replaced by a modern [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 6-speed manual transmission in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cangialosi|first=Paul|title=How to rebuild and modify high-performance manual transmissions|year=2010|publisher=CarTech |isbn=978-1934709290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the second Corvette Indy Pace Car was released. It was the first convertible Corvette since 1975. A Center High Mounted Signal Light (CHMSL) – a third center brake light – was added in 1986 to comply with safety regulations. While the color of the pace car used in the race was yellow, all 1986 convertibles also had an Indy 500 emblem mounted on the console, making any color a "pace car edition". In 1987, the B2K twin-turbo option became available from the factory. The [[Callaway Cars Incorporated|Callaway]] Corvette was a [[Regular Production Option]] (RPO B2K). The B2K option coexisted from 1990 to 1991 with the ZR-1 option, which then replaced it. Early B2Ks produced {{convert|345|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corvetteactioncenter.com/specs/callaway/87tt.html|title=1987 Twin Turbo Callaway Corvette|publisher=Corvette Action Center|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; later versions boasted {{convert|450|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|613|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corvetteactioncenter.com/specs/callaway/90tt.html|title=1990 Twin Turbo Callaway Corvette|publisher=Corvette Action Center|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1988 saw the 35th Anniversary Edition of the Corvette. Each of these featured a special badge with an identification number mounted next to the gear selector, and were finished with a white exterior, wheels, and interior.&lt;ref name="Standard Catalog of Corvette" /&gt; In 1990, the ZR1 option Corvette was introduced with the LT5 engine designed by Lotus and built in the Mercury Marine plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The LT5 engine was a 4 cam (DOHC) design producing 375&amp;nbsp;hp (280&amp;nbsp;kW) when at "open throttle". The C4 ZR1 ran from 1990 thru 1995 model years. In 1991, all Corvettes received updates to the body, interior, and wheels. The convex rear fascia that set the 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model was now included on L98 Corvettes, making the styling of the expensive ZR-1 even closer to that of the base cars. The most obvious difference remaining between the base and ZR-1 models besides the wider rear wheels was the location of the CHMSL, which was integrated into the new rear fascia used on the base model, but remained at the top of the rear-hatch on the ZR-1's.&lt;ref name="Corvette Black" /&gt;

[[File:92 Corvette ZR1.jpg|thumb|left|1992 Corvette ZR-1]]

For the 1992 model year, the {{convert|300|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} [[GM LT engine|LT1]] engine was introduced, an increase of {{convert|50|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured [[Reverse-flow cylinder head|reverse-flow cooling]] (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called "Optispark", the distributor was driven directly off the front of the camshaft and mounted in front of the timing cover, just above the crankshaft and harmonic balancer.&lt;ref name="Corvette Black" /&gt; Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control which utilized the Corvette's brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear wheel spin and possible loss of control. The traction control device could be switched off if desired.&lt;ref name="Standard Catalog of Corvette" /&gt;

[[File:1996 Corvette Grand Sport 2.jpg|thumb|1996 Corvette Grand Sport]]

A special 40th Anniversary Edition was released in 1993, which featured a commemorative Ruby Red color, 40th anniversary badges, and embroidered seat backs. The 1993 Corvette also marked the introduction of the Passive Keyless Entry System, making it the first GM car to feature it. Production of the ZR-1 ended in 1995, after 6,939 cars had been built.&lt;ref name="2003newtonprojects"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Richard|title=101 projects for your Corvette : 1984-1996|year=2003|publisher=Motorbooks International |isbn=978-0760314616}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996 was the final year of C4 production, and featured special models and options, including the Grand Sport and Collector Edition, OBD II (On-Board Diagnostics), run flat tires, and the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT4|LT4]] engine. The {{convert|330|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT4|LT4]] V8 was available only with a manual transmission, while all {{convert|300|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} LT1 Corvettes used automatic transmissions.&lt;ref name="Nothin' but Muscle" /&gt;

Chevrolet released the Grand Sport (GS) version in 1996 to mark the end of production of the C4 Corvette. The Grand Sport moniker was a nod to the original Grand Sport model produced in 1963. A total of 1,000 GS Corvettes were produced, 810 as coupes and 190 as convertibles.&lt;ref name="Nothin' but Muscle" /&gt; The 1996 GS came with the high-performance [[Chevrolet small-block engine#LT4|LT4]] [[V8 engine]], producing {{convert|330|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Grand Sport came only in Admiral Blue with a white stripe down the middle, and black wheels and two red stripes on the front left wheel arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Corvette milestones|year=1996|publisher=Motorbooks International |isbn=978-0760300954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fifth generation (C5; 1997–2004) ===
{{Main|Chevrolet Corvette (C5)}}
[[File:Chevrolet-Corvette-C5.jpg|thumb|Corvette C5 coupe]]
[[File:Chevrolet C5 Corvette Convertible (Les chauds vendredis '10).jpg|thumb|Corvette C5 convertible]]

The C5 was the most completely redesigned Corvette since the Corvette's inception in 1953.  Production of the C5 Corvette actually began in 1996 but quality/manufacturing issues saw its release to the public in mass delayed until 1997, and continuing through the 2004 model year.  The C5 was a completely new design that featured many new concepts and manufacturing breakthroughs that would be carried forward to the C6 &amp; C7.  It had a top speed of {{convert|176|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and was judged by the automotive press as a breakthrough with vastly improved dynamics in nearly every area over the previous C4 design.  Innovations included a 0.29 drag coefficient, near 50/50 weight distribution, active handling (the first ever stability control for a Corvette), and electronic power steering assistance.  It also weighed less than the C4.

An all new LS1 aluminum engine (Gen III small block) featured individual ignition coils for each cylinder, and aluminum block and pistons. It was initially rated at {{convert|345|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}, but was increased to {{convert|350|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} in the 2001 edition. The new engine, combined with the new body, was able to achieve up to 28 mpg on the highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurn|first=Walt|title=High-performance C5 Corvette builder's guide|year=2007|publisher=CarTech |isbn=978-1932494334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corvette C5, Mike Mueller, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All Corvettes Are Red, James Schefter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corvette C5, Patrick Paternie, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Road &amp; Track Corvette Portfolio 1997-2002:(Road &amp; Track Series), Clarke, R.M, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corvette: Iconic Cars, Car &amp; Driver, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corvette Racing, David Kimble, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corvette: Sports Car Superstar, Editors of Consumer Guide, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corvette: Fifty Years, Randy Leffingwell, 2002, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pace|first=Harold|title=The Immortal Corvette: 1997-2003|url=http://www.automedia.com/The_Immortal_Corvette_19972003/res20031201c5/1/|publisher=autoMedia.com|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Z06-Blk-7.jpg|thumb|Corvette Z06]]

For its first year, the C5 was available only as a coupe, although the new platform was designed from the ground up to be a convertible, which returned in 1998, followed by the fixed-roof coupe (FRC) in 1999. One concept for the FRC was for it to be a stripped-down model with a possible V6 engine (nicknamed in-house as the "Billy Bob").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Richard|title=Corvette C5 performance projects|year=2006|publisher=MBI Pub. |isbn=978-0760320815|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, FRC plans laid the groundwork for the return in 2001 of the Z06, an RPO option not seen since Zora's 1963 race-ready Corvette.&lt;ref&gt;Schefter, pp. 96, 105, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Z06 model replaced the FRC model as the highest performance C5 Corvette. Instead of a heavier double-overhead cam engine like the ZR-1 of the C4 generation, the Z06 used an LS6, a {{convert|385|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} derivative of the standard LS1 engine. Using the much more rigid fixed roof design allowed the Z06 unprecedented handling thanks to upgraded brakes and less body flex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Essential musclecars|year=2004|publisher=Motorbooks International|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0760319666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those characteristics, along with the use of materials such as a titanium exhaust system and a carbon fiber hood in the 2004 model year, led to further weight savings and performance gains for the C5 Z06. The LS6 was later upgraded to {{convert|405|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}for 2002–2004. Although the Z06's rated power output equal to that of the C4 ZR-1, the improved rigidity, suspension, brakes, and reduced weight of the C5 produced a car quicker than C4 ZR-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Endres|first=Christopher P.|title=Chevy LS1/LS6 performance : high performance modifications for street and racing : covers Chevy LS1 and LS6 engines, 1997 and up |year=1996 |publisher=HP Books|location=New York |isbn=978-1557884077|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sixth generation (C6; 2005–2013) ===
{{Main|Chevrolet Corvette (C6)}}
[[File:Chevrolet Corvette Coupé Luxury (C6) – Frontansicht, 16. April 2011, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|Corvette C6 coupe]]
[[File:Yellow Corvette (8028247140).jpg|thumb|Corvette C6]]

For the C6 Corvette GM wanted to focus more upon refining the C5 than trying to redesign it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Corvette: Sports Car Superstar |author=Editors of Consumer Guide |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not prevent GM from trying to sell the C6 as being "all new".  The public immediately saw through the marketing ploy and GM's use of "simply changing the part numbers" despite a large number of the parts being interchangeable between the C5 &amp; C6. Car &amp; Driver, along with Motor Trend, quickly noticed the inaccuracy, noting that the C6 was more an "evolution of the C5, instead of a complete redo".  This even led C&amp;D to term the C6 as the "C5 and 11/16ths". 
To highlight the new generation, Chevrolet gave the C6 a face lift; reducing the exterior body overhangs for a noticeably overall reduction in outward dimension.  The front headlights were also redone, deleting the traditional "pop-up" headlights, opting for a more modern look. Beyond that, the majority of the changes focused on improving the quality of the interior. 
The C6 has a slightly longer wheelbase than the C5, a change necessitated by the use of a different automatic transmission which resulted in the rear linkage points being relocated; thus presenting a "longer" wheelbase.

The C6 brought a new and improved interior compared to the C5. As a result of the upgraded interior, the C6 had an slight increase in passenger hip room.  It also sported an updated LS1/LS6 engine now called the LS2.  This engine was primarily an LS1/LS6 with a bump in displacement from 5.7L to 6.0 liters. The increased displacement of the 6.0 bumped the LS2's horsepower up by 50 BHP over its LS1 progenitor, although still 5 BHP less than the upgraded LS6 engine found in the previous C5 Z06.  Thus the LS2 was now at 364 cu in, and it produced {{convert|400|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 6000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|400|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 4400&amp;nbsp;rpm, giving the vehicle a 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph time of under 4.2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Phil|title=Corvette C6|year=2004|publisher=Motorbooks International|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0760318652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its top speed was {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

The C6 generation did not match the previous generation's relatively good [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], despite its relatively low 0.28 [[drag coefficient]] and low curb weight, achieving 16/26 mpg (city/highway) equipped with automatic or manual transmissions; like all manual transmission Corvettes since 1989, it is fitted with Computer Aided Gear Selection (CAGS) to improve fuel economy by requiring drivers to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in low-speed/low-throttle conditions. This feature helps the C6 avoid the [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] by achieving better fuel economy.&lt;ref name="CAGS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.web-cars.com/corvette/1989.php |title=The Corvette Story |accessdate=Sep 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918144316/http://www.web-cars.com/corvette/1989.php |archivedate=2012-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Z06 arrived as a 2006 model in the third quarter of 2005. It has a 7.0&amp;nbsp;L version of the [[small block]] engine codenamed ''[[GM LS engine#LS7|LS7]]''. At 427.6 cubic inches, the Z06 was the largest small block ever offered from General Motors. Because of the Corvette's former use of 427 cubic-inch big blocks in the late-1960s and early 1970s, the LS7's size was rounded down to 427 cubic inches. Official output was {{convert|505|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and has a 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} time of 3.7 seconds. Top speed is {{convert|198|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/corvette/2006/first-drive-2006-chevrolet-corvette-z06.html|title=First Drive: 2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06|publisher=Insideline.com|date=August 31, 2005|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another first for a Corvette, the Z06 featured a full aluminum chasis. The frame mirrored the C5/6 architecture but substituting aluminum hydroformed rails and aluminum extrustions and castings fore and aft. This dropped weight from 419 to 287 pounds while improving chassis stiffness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2006-chevrolet-corvette-z06-first-drive-review-how-light-can-it-get-page-3|title=2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 - First Drive Review|access-date=2017-07-08|magazine=Car and Driver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corvette ZR1 avant.JPG|thumb|left|Corvette ZR1]]

For 2008, the Corvette received a mild freshening: a new [[GM LS engine|LS3]] engine with displacement increased to {{convert|6.2|L|cuin|abbr=on}}, resulting in {{convert|430|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|424|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} ({{convert|436|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|428|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} if ordered with the optional performance exhaust). The 6-speed manual transmission also has improved shift linkage and a 0–60 time of 4.0 seconds, while the automatic is set up for quicker shifts giving the C6 automatic a 0–60 time of 4.0 seconds, quicker than any other production automatic Corvette. The interior was slightly updated and a new 4LT leather-wrap interior package was added. The wheels were also updated to a new five-spoke design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/corvette/2008/road-test.html |title=First Drive: 2008 Chevrolet Corvette |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=Apr 27, 2007 |accessdate=Nov 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818232707/http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/corvette/2008/road-test.html |archivedate=August 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZR1 was formally announced in a December 2007 press statement by General Motors, where it was revealed that their target of {{convert|100|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} per {{convert|1|L|cuin|abbr=on}} had been reached by a new "LS9" engine with an Eaton-[[supercharged]] 6.2-liter engine producing {{convert|638|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|604|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.

The historical name ''Grand Sport'' returned to the Corvette lineup in 2010 as an entirely new model series that replaced the Z51 option. The new model was basically an LS3 equipped Z06 with a steel frame instead of aluminum. It retained many of the features of the Z06 including a wide body with 18x9.5 and 19x12 inch wheels, dry sump oiling (manual transmission coupes only), 6-piston 14" front brakes and 4-piston rear, and improved suspension.&lt;ref name="Mueller"/&gt; Manual power train equipped G/S coupe models receive a tweaked LS3 with a forged crank, are built in Z06 fashion by hand, and utilize a dry-sump oil system. The first three gears were also made shorter for better throttle response and faster acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/corvette/2010/road-test-2/|title=2010 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport First Drive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new launch control system was introduced for all models that allows for sub-4-second 0–60. EPA is estimated 26 MPG highway, 1.0 G on skid pad.&lt;ref name="SCoC" /&gt;

Beginning with the 2011 model year, buyers of the Corvette Z06 and ZR1 were offered the opportunity to assist in the build of their engine. Titled the "Corvette Engine Build Experience," buyers paid extra to be flown to the Wixom, Michigan Performance Build Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Earnest|first=Brian|title=Corvette the great American sports car|year=2010|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, WI|isbn=978-1440217531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants helped the assembly line workers build the V8 engine, then took delivery of the car at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, KY, near the Corvette final assembly point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/07/13/2011-chevy-corvette-engines-can-be-built-by-owner/|title=2011 Chevy Corvette Engines Can be Built by Owner|publisher=Automoblog.net|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012|date=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development for the seventh generation Corvette started in 2007. Originally set to be introduced for the 2011 model year, its introduction was delayed for three years. It was finally released for the 2014 model year.&lt;ref name="automag2012"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1201_2014_chevrolet_c7_corvette_spied/index.html |title=Spied: 2014 Chevrolet C7 Corvette |journal=Automobile Magazine |date=January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222025544/http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1201_2014_chevrolet_c7_corvette_spied/index.html |archivedate=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mid-engine]] and [[rear-engine design|rear-engine]] layouts had been considered, but the [[front-engine]], rear-wheel drive [[rear-wheel drive|(RWD)]] platform was chosen to keep production costs lower.&lt;ref name="motortrend-c7"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/auto_news/2008/112_0812_c7_chevrolet_corvette_update/ |title=No Mid-Engine For Chevrolet Corvette C7 |first=Mike |last=Connor|journal=Motor Trend|date=December 2008|accessdate=Sep 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To GM's product planners and marketers, the fact that the Corvette had become known as an "old man's toy" became a prime factor in developing the next generation. Studies showed that about 46 percent of Corvette buyers in 2012, through October, were 55 or older, compared with 22 percent of [[Audi R8]] and 30 percent of [[Porsche 911]] customers. The head of Chevy marketing, Chris Perry, acknowledges that too many people saw it as the car of "the successful plumber." John Fitzpatrick, Corvette's marketing manager said "It's the old saying, 'Nobody wants to be seen driving an old man's car, but everybody wants to be seen driving a young man's car.' "&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt; To counter that perception GM planned to make the new generation C7 more aspirational to younger people. Towards that end, a camouflaged version of the car was made available in the popular video game ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins |first=Tim |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-11/corvette-not-just-for-successful-plumbers-with-new-design.html |title=Corvette Not Just for Successful Plumbers With New Design |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-01-11 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the marketing effort associated with the introduction of the new generation, the 2013 Indianapolis 500 utilized a Corvette for the 12th time as its pace car.

Sales success of the new Corvette is important to GM. [[The Motley Fool]] reports that Chevrolet could be earning $10,000 or more in gross profit for every Corvette it sells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/09/the-2014-corvette-stingray-steps-on-the-gas.aspx|title=The 2014 Corvette Stingray Steps on the Gas|publisher=Motley Fool|date=2013-11-09|accessdate=2013-11-18|author=Adam Levine-Weinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM's profit on sales is separate from the profits made by the individual dealerships selling the cars to the public.

The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette uses an LT1 6.2 L V8 (376 cu in) making {{convert|455|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} or {{convert|460|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} with the optional performance exhaust. The LT1 engine (the "LT1" designation was first used by GM in 1970 and then later in 1992.) is in the Gen V family of [[GM LT engine|small block]] engines, which will be used in GM vehicles as the new small V8 option. It features three advanced technologies to the new LT1 V8 engine: direct injection, variable valve timing, and an active fuel management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Oct/1024_GenVSmallBlock.html |title = All-New 2014 Corvette LT1 V-8 a Technological Powerhouse|date = 2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel injectors are located under the intake manifold. The Corvette remains rear-wheel drive with the transaxle located in the rear. Transmission choices include a 7-speed manual or a 6-speed (2014) / 8-speed (2015-) automatic with paddle shifters. The new interior includes wide-bottom seats as standard, with sportier versions with high side bolsters optional. The Corvette's flag logo has been revised for the new car and a small casting of a stingray has been added to the car's ornamentation.

Features of the new generation's structure include a carbon fiber hood and removable roof panel. The fenders, doors and rear quarter panels remain composite. At the rear of the car, the trademark round taillights have changed to a more squarish form.  The underbody panels are made of "carbon-nano" composite and it makes use of a new aluminum frame which locates the four wheels an inch farther apart, front to rear and side to side.  Luggage space decreased by 33% from the previous generation's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/new/sns-mct-bc-auto-chevroletstingray-review-20131101,0,5604602.story |title=2014 Chevrolet StingRay Review |accessdate=2013-11-10 |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Mark |last=Phelan |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110050247/http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/new/sns-mct-bc-auto-chevroletstingray-review-20131101%2C0%2C5604602.story |archivedate=2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall weight of the car was not announced by General Motors for many months after its first showing in January 2013.

The new generation Corvette resurrected the "Stingray" name (originally spelled "Sting Ray" on 1963 to 1967 models and "Stingray" from 1969 to 1976), last used in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2012/Oct/1018_CorvetteCrossedFlag.html|title=Next-generation Corvette to Debut 1.13.13 in Detroit|work=media.gm.com|date=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand Sport models were available in 10 exterior colors and could have the optional Heritage Package which included hash-mark fender graphics (available in six colors.  As part of the introduction of the Grand Sport in Geneva, Switzerland, Chevrolet also announced a [[2017 Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport Collector Edition|Grand Sport Collector Edition]], which was to be limited to 1,000 vehicles in total and only 850 for the US Market.  Final production numbers show 784 Coupes and 151 Convertibles were built; 935 total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corvettemuseum.org/2017-final-corvette-stats/|title=2017 Final Corvette Stats – National Corvette Museum|website=www.corvettemuseum.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The $4,995 Z25 Option Package was a cosmetic upgrade that contained the following: blue fender hash-marks, two-tone blue leather seating surfaces with a logo on the seat headrest, blue leather stitching, serialized edition numbered dash plaque and carpeted floor mats with logo, 

For the 2019 model year the ZR1 variant returned. This model features a new LT5 engine. The long block of the LT5 is the same as the LT4, but the supercharger displacement was increased from 1.7 liters to 2.65 liters. The C7 ZR1 power output is 755 horsepower.

[[File:SaturnVcenterVette.JPG|thumb|Astronaut [[Alan Shepard]]'s Corvette on display at the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]]]]
Astronaut [[Alan Shepard]], a long-time Corvette owner, was invited by then GM Chief Engineer [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] to drive pre-production Corvette models. General Motors executives later gave Shepard a 1972 model with a Bill Mitchell interior. [[Jim Rathmann]], a [[Melbourne, Florida]] Chevrolet dealer and winner of the 1960 Indy 500, befriended astronauts Shepard, [[Gus Grissom]], and [[Gordon Cooper]]. Rathmann convinced GM President [[Ed Cole]] to set up a program which supplied each astronaut with a pair of new cars each year. Most chose a family car for their wives and a Corvette for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Bean | first=Alan | url=http://www.alanbean.com/astronaut_training.cfm | title=Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir ''Last Man On The Moon'', [[Gene Cernan]] describes how this worked. The astronauts received brand-new Corvettes, which they were given the option to purchase at a "used" price after they'd been driven 3000 miles. [[Alan Bean]] recalls Corvettes lined up in the parking lot outside the astronaut offices at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, and friendly races between Shepard and Grissom along the Florida beach roads and on beaches as local police turned a blind eye.&lt;ref name="astrovette"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Nelson | first=John | title=The AstroVette an astronaut's Corvette from the beginning of the Space Age | journal=Vette | date=June 2009 | url=http://www.vetteweb.com/features/vet1101_1969_chevrolet_astrovette_stingray/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shepard, Grissom and Cooper even pulled each other on skis in the shallow water. The Mercury and later astronauts were unofficially tied to the Corvette and appeared in official photographs with their cars and with mock-ups of space vehicles such as the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] or [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]. Cooper talked of the races along Cocoa Beach in his eulogy of Shepard at the Johnson Space Center in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=French | first=Francis | title=Into That Silent Sea: Trailblazers of the Space Era, 1961–1965 | year=2009 | publisher=Bison Books | isbn=978-0-8032-2639-5 | page=261 | first2=Colin | last2=Burgess | first3=Paul | last3=Haney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept cars ==
Corvette [[concept car]]s have inspired the designs of several generations of Corvettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=auto editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=Corvette: 50th anniversary|year=2003|publisher=Publications International |isbn=978-0785379874}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Corvette, [[Harley Earl]]'s 1953 EX-122 [[Chevrolet Corvette C1#Origin 1951|Corvette prototype]] was itself, a concept show car, first shown to the public at the 1953 GM [[Motorama]] at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City on January 17, 1953. It was brought to production in six months with only minor changes.

[[File:1966 Chevrolet Ad-Mako shark II.jpg|thumb|[[Corvette Mako Shark (concept car)|Mako Shark]] II advertisement (1966)]]

Harley Earl's successor, [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]] was the man behind most of the Corvette concepts of the 1960s and 1970s. The second-generation (C2) of 1963 was his, and its design first appeared on the [[Corvette Stingray (concept car)|Stingray Racer]] of 1959. It made its public debut at Maryland's Marlborough Raceway on April 18, 1959, powered by a {{convert|283|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8 with experimental 11:1 compression aluminum cylinder heads and took fourth place. It raced through 1960 wearing only "Sting Ray" badges before retiring to tour the auto-show circuit in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Randy |last=Leffingwell |title=Corvette: fifty years|publisher=MBI |year=2002 |isbn=9780760311806 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 the XP-755 [[Corvette Mako Shark (concept car)|Mako Shark]] show car was designed by Larry Shinoda as a concept for future Corvettes. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired by the look of that very [[Mako shark|fast fish]]. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production Sting Ray.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1965 Mitchell removed the original concept body and redesigned it as the Mako Shark II. Chevrolet actually created two of them, only one of which was fully functional. The original Mako Shark was then retroactively called the Mako Shark I. The Mako Shark II debuted in 1965 as a show car and this concept influenced Mitchell's redesigned Corvette of 1968.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[Chevrolet Aerovette|Aerovette]] has a [[mid-engine]] configuration using a [[Transverse engine|transverse]] mounting of its V-8 engine. [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]]'s engineers originally built two XP-882s during 1969. [[John DeLorean]], Chevy general manager, ordered one for display at the 1970 [[New York Auto Show]]. In 1972, DeLorean authorized further work on the XP-882. A near-identical body in [[aluminum alloy]] was constructed and became the XP-895 "Reynolds Aluminum Car." Duntov and Mitchell responded with two [[Chevrolet Vega]] (stillborn) [[Wankel engine|Wankel]] 2-rotor engines joined together as a 4-rotor {{convert|420|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine which was used to power the XP-895. It was first shown in late 1973. The 4-rotor show car was outfitted with a {{convert|400|cuin|L|abbr=on}} small-block V8 in 1977 and rechristened Aerovette. GM chairman [[Thomas Murphy (chairman)|Thomas Murphy]] approved the Aerovette for 1980 production, but Mitchell's retirement that year, combined with then Corvette chief engineer [[Dave McLellan]]'s lack of enthusiasm for the mid-engine design and slow-selling data on mid-engined cars killed the last hope for a mid-engine Corvette.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Owner demographics ==
According to research by [[Specialty Equipment Market Association]] and Experian Automotive, as of 2009, there were approximately 750,000 Corvettes of all model years registered in the United States. Corvette owners were fairly equally distributed throughout the country, with the highest density in Michigan (3.47 per 1000 residents) and the lowest density in Utah, Mississippi, and Hawaii (1.66, 1.63, and 1.53 registrations per 1000 residents). 47% of them hold college degrees (significantly above the nationwide average of 27%), and 82% are between ages of 40 and 69 (median age being 53).&lt;ref name="demographics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sema.org/?q=node/1697 |title=Vette Owners Quick to Customize |publisher=SEMA |date=Jan 15, 2009 |accessdate=Sep 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511072329/http://www.sema.org/?q=node%2F1697 |archivedate=2013-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, three C-1 Corvettes were race modified and entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans by team owner Briggs Cunningham and which were numbered #1, #2 and #3 cars in the race. The numbered #3 car was driven by John Fitch and Bob Grossman and it had finished the race in eighth place overall, but it had won the big bore GT class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/lemans/news/gm-racing-corvette-history-at-le-mans/|title=GM Racing - Corvette history at Le Mans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car is based on the C5 generation of the Chevrolet Corvette sports car, yet is designed purely for motorsports use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|year=1991|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|page=156|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_KuYDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Chevrolet Corvette C5-R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of the most dominant cars in GT categories, with wins at the 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as championships in the American Le Mans Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|year=1999|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=Chevrolet+Corvette+C5-R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corvette C5-Rs debuted in 1999 and continues to be raced to this day, although the C5-R has effectively been replaced by the Corvette C6.R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLorenzo|first=Matt|title=The Corvette Dynasty|year=2007|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-932855-82-1|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C6.R GT1 (Z06)'''
In 2005, the factory Corvette Team began racing the C6.R to coincide with the new sixth generation (C6) Corvette being released to the public. Private teams, primarily in Europe, continued to race the C5-R for a couple of years before switching to the C6.R. Corvette C6.R went on to win its class at every race it entered in the 2005 [[ALMS]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 Carbon vs. 2010 Corvette Grand Sport vs. 2002 Corvette Z06 Comparison Test and Video|url=http://www.insideline.com/chevrolet/corvette/2011/2002-chevrolet-corvette-z06-vs-2010-corvette-grand-sport-vs-2011-corvette-z06-carbon-comparison-test-and-video.html|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of 2009, Corvette had clinched four consecutive ALMS GT1 team and manufacturers titles (2005–2008) and three [[Le Mans 24 Hour]] class victories in the LMGT1 category (2005, 2006, 2009). 2007 and 2008 races were won by the factory [[Aston Martin]] squad's [[DBR9]]. The last official race for factory GT1 Corvettes was the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pratt &amp; Miller Engineering Introduces Corvette C6RS Supercar for the Street |url=http://www.prattmillerc6rs.com/pressrelease.htm |work=Corvette C6RS |accessdate=10 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323040729/http://www.prattmillerc6rs.com/pressrelease.htm |archivedate=23 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C6.R GT2 (ZR1)'''
While some privateers continued to use GT1 version of the C6.R in Europe, the official factory team [[Corvette Racing]] switched from the slowly dying GT1 category to the much more competitive and popular GT2 class in mid-2009. The new GT2 C6.R used a modified version of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1|ZR1]] model body, but does not have the ZR1 supercharged engine. GT2 rules are based more on production vehicles, therefore the GT2 C6.R naturally aspirated engine was considerably more restricted and less powerful than its predecessor. The car debuted at [[Mid-Ohio]]'s ALMS round. They achieved one ALMS race victory in the remaining 2009 ALMS season, and one victory at the final round of 2010 ALMS season, [[Petit Le Mans]]. Corvette Racing's two GT2 C6.Rs also led most of the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], but both cars were forced to retire. Racing in the new GTE Pro class, the C6.R raced in the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]] with the No.&amp;nbsp;73 car taking the class victory. The No.&amp;nbsp;74 car led the class for most of the race but crashed in the morning hours. The C6.R raced by Larbre Competition also took the GTE Am class victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schilke|first=Nancy|title=Shanghai victory sees Larbre Competition crowned GTE Am world champions|url=http://www.motorsport.com/wec/news/shanghai-victory-sees-larbre-competition-crowned-gte-am-world-champions/|work=Race reports|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Corvette Racing returned to glory in the ALMS winning 4 of 10 races and claiming the Driver's, Team, and Manufacturer's Championships. Corvette Racing repeated the feat in 2013 by winning 5 of 10 races and claiming the Driver's, Team and Manufacturer's Championships again.

In 2014, Corvette Racing introduced the new C7.R to coincide with the launch of the seventh-generation C7 Corvette.

The '''Chevrolet Tracker''' (创酷) in China is a subcompact [[Crossover (vehicle)|crossover SUV]] produced by [[SAIC-GM]] for the Chinese market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autonews.com/shanghai-auto-show/chevy-revives-trailblazer-tracker-china|title=Chevy revives Trailblazer, Tracker for China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:2019 Chevrolet Tracker 003.jpg|thumb|left|2019 Chevrolet Tracker rear]]
The Chevrolet Tracker in the Chinese market was revealed in 2019 alongside the Trailblazer. The Chinese market Tracker was designed to replace the Chevrolet Trax in China, and shares the same Chinese name as the Chevrolet Trax. On the side note, the Chevrolet Trax was also called the Tracker in several other markets.

Despite the use of the Tracker name, the Chinese market Tracker is not related to the [[Chevrolet Tracker (Americas)|Chevrolet Tracker]] sold in North America as a rebadged Suzuki Escudo from the 1990s to the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/344929/chevrolet-trailblazer-tracker-shanghai-debut/|title=Chevrolet Trailblazer And Tracker Debut Modern Looks In China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GEM platform which the Chinese market Tracker was built on was designed for developing automotive markets including China, Latin America and Southeast Asia. The Chevrolet Tracker launched in China in 2019 is one of the vehicles with the GEM platform and is therefore not intended for the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/04/all-new-chevrolet-tracker-introduced-in-china/|title=All-New Chevrolet Tracker Introduced In China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engines==
The Chinese market Tracker is available with a 3-cylinder 1.0 turbo engine producing 84&amp;nbsp;kW and a 3-cylinder 1.3 turbo engine producing 121&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chejiahao.autohome.com.cn/info/3608349#pvareaid=28086821198|title=雪佛兰创界Trailblazer及创酷Tracker亮相上海车展}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Trailblazer''' is a [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] slotted between the [[Chevrolet Trax|Trax]] and the larger [[Chevrolet Equinox|Equinox]] sold in China. It will make its debut in North America in 2020 as a 2021 model.

== Overview ==
The Trailblazer was launched on 16 April 2019 at the 18th [[Auto Shanghai|Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition]] alongside the [[Chevrolet Tracker (China)|Tracker]], that both replace the outgoing Trax. It is a compact crossover that will be aimed for developed markets while the subcompact Tracker will be aimed for emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carscoops.com/2019/04/new-chevy-tracker-and-trailblazer-revealed-in-sporty-redline-trim-in-china/|title=New Chevy Tracker And Trailblazer Revealed In Sporty Redline Trim In China|date=April 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1122401_2020-chevrolet-trailblazer-debuts-at-2019-shanghai-auto-show|title=2020 Chevrolet Trailblazer debuts at 2019 Shanghai auto show|website=Motor Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by [[GM Korea]], the Trailblazer will be assembled in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea]].

The Trailblazer made its North American debut at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in November 2019, and will be sold in the United States starting in early 2020 as a 2021 [[model year]] vehicle. Chevrolet announced that the MSRP will be priced below $20,000(USD). There will be five trim levels: L, LS, LT, ACTIV and RS. The latter two will come standard with dual exhaust and top of the line features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/11/2021-chevrolet-trailblazer-makes-u-s-debut-will-start-at-under-20000/ "2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer Priced at Under $20k"] from GM Authority (November 21, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; The ACTIV and RS will also feature a two-tone roof.&lt;ref name="carlitus"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carlitus.net/2020-chevy-trailblazer/|website=carlitus.net|title=2020 Chevy Trailblazer Ready for Its Comeback in the U.S.|accessdate=2019-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the mid-size Trailblazer that was manufactured between 2002 and 2009, as well as the international market Trailblazer that is based on the Colorado pickup, this version of the Trailblazer will be slotted above the Trax, and below the Equinox. It features similar styling to the 2019 [[Chevrolet Blazer (crossover)|Blazer]], but in a smaller package.&lt;ref name="autoblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2019/05/29/2021-chevy-trailblazer-revealed-blazer-little-brother/|website=autoblog.com|title=2021 Chevy Trailblazer is revealed as the Blazer's little sibling|accessdate=2019-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2020, the Trailblazer was launched in [[South Korea]]. The Korean-market model is larger in dimension than Trailblazers sold in other markets, with a length of 4,425mm and width of 1,810mm.&lt;ref name="www.chevrolet.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chevrolet.co.kr/rv/trailblazer-specification.gm|title=쉐보레 트레일블레이저 제원 안내/쉐보레 Chevrolet |accessdate=2020-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chevrolet Menlo''' (畅巡) is an [[electric vehicle|electric]] compact wagon/CUV, sold exclusively in China.  It is the first Chevrolet EV available in China, as the [[Chevrolet Bolt]] is not sold there.&lt;ref name="gma20200220" /&gt; 

==History==

The Chevrolet Menlo is based on the Chevrolet FNR-X concept shown at the 2017 [[Auto Shanghai]] show.  The production version of the Menlo debuted at a gala event in [[Hefei]], Anhui on November 8, 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/cn/en/2019/Nov/1108_Chevrolet_Menlo_EV_and_Blazer_SUV.html| title=Chevrolet Menlo EV and Chevrolet Blazer SUV Make China Debut| publisher=General Motors| date=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and was also shown at the 2019 [[Auto Guangzhou]] show.  Pre-ordering began in December, and deliveries started on February 20, 2020.&lt;ref name="gma20200220"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/02/all-new-chevrolet-menlo-ev-officially-launches-in-china/| title=All-New Chevrolet Menlo EV Officially Launches In China| first=Deivis | last=Centeno| publisher=GM Authority| date=20 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to a government subsidy of up to 100,000 yuan (approximately $14,250 USD), the Menlo is the lowest-priced compact electric crossover in China.&lt;ref name="gma20200220" /&gt;

Unlike the rest of the Chevrolet's models, the Menlo has a unique trim level naming scheme, which includes Starshare, Galaxy, Nebula and Starlux. It also features three driving modes (standard, sport, and economy) and three levels of energy recycling.&lt;ref name="gma20200220" /&gt;

==Battery==

The Menlo has a lithium-ion battery, with 52.5 kWh capacity and a range of up to 410 km on the [[New European Driving Cycle|NEDC]]. It generates up to {{convert|110|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque.&lt;ref name="gma20200220" /&gt;  This battery is also used in the [[Buick Velite 6]] Plus.
